Review,Varietal
"Wonderful juicy serious Barbera. Ultra clean and vibrant on the nose with tons of red fruit and subtle hibiscus fruit. The crunchy fruit on the palate just goes on and on. Very approachable despite the significant structure and I'm very intrigued to see what a couple of years in the cellar does to this little guy. Absolutely world class wine making here resulting in exceptional complexity achieved at this very reasonable price point.
",Barbera
"This is a juicy, big, bold wine that perfectly captures the essence of Barbera! It has a beautiful harmony of fruit, depth, and character that lingers on the palate. Vignetti Massa has quickly become one of my favorite Italian wine producers-- his expressions are unique and far from shy. If you're looking for something equally unique in a white wine, grab a bottle of one of his Timorassos!!

"Domaine les Pins is a family run estate spanning five generations of vignerons.  Their vineyards are exclusively planted with Cab Franc, and their dedication to the grape shows in this amazing bottle.  Fresh, easy drinking and super food friendly, this is an awesome everyday red to have on hand.
",Cabernet Franc
"My visit to Bourgueil earlier this year was a revelation.  And for those not in the know (because I really didn't know that much myself), Bourgueil is one of the lesser known Cabernet Franc appellations sitting on the north side of the Loire River just across from Chinon.  About 30 minutes west of Tours gets you to the village of Bourgeuil.  Farms traverse the landscape with a mixture of agriculture but grapes dominate the view.  I have long been a fan of Cabernet Franc.  I find it to be one of the more versatile reds for pairing with food and I love lower alcohol and medium-bodied textured wines which make Cab Franc a must mid-week drink for me.  Upon arriving at Domaine les Pins we met with vigneron Philippe Pitault-Landry.  A father-son venture now, these detail oriented farmers are making reds that smell like classic Cabernet but with Pinot-like texture.  We tasted the new releases and the 2015 ""Les Rochettes"" was out of the gate charming.  Full of brushy herbal notes of sage and wild thyme, ripe black cherries and flavors of olive tapenade, this is a sumptuous red that is weighty and yet light on its feet.  The vintage of 2015 is a huge success for them and for the region, offering a generosity of fruit that make the wines more inviting and immediately accessible.  We drifted through the single plot, Les Clos and the Vieilles Vignes as well and they were most impressive.  Alas, those wines are due a little later in the year along with some older wines from their cellar.  The Les Rochettes though is truly the red of the summer for me.  It's versatility will make it an easy foil for things like roast chicken, grilled pork chops and leg of lamb.  Lots of herbs and lots of veggies to go with those and you will become as enamored with Bourgueil as I am now.  This is a lot of wine from people who really believe in what they are doing and would easily be twice the price from a more famous region.
",Cabernet Franc
"The bouquet of this wine instantly brought me back to my childhood in Ontario, Canada, where,  every summer,  I'd pick wild strawberries and make preserves with my mom. Wonderful berry fruit from the warm 2015 vintage is present, along with purple flowers and a savory element not unlike  black olives. On the palate the fruit has plenty of juicy depth and character with mineral notes and tannins that balance, not overwhelm. I enjoyed this with shredded, leftover roasted chicken leg tossed in a simple spinach salad with fennel and shallots. It would be equally enjoyable with pork tenderloin or warm farro salad with roasted vegetables. This is a fantastic wine.
",Cabernet Franc
"Riper berry fruit thanks to the healthy 2015 vintage, but with plenty of traditional green notes of brush and savory olive, plus blue floral aromatics, this is classic Cabernet Franc that shows lift and earthiness without sacrificing superior drinkability. Domaine Les Pins is an easy intro to Bourgueil, and if you’re not interested in exploring Loire Valley appellations, ""Les Rochettes"" is a bright, delicious, unbelievably-priced addition to your summer red lineup.
",Cabernet Franc
"Les Pins is a small producer out of Bourgueil, in the Loire Valley, a small region you may never have heard of, but ought to pay attention to. It is the neighboring region to the famous Chinon.  I find the wines of Bourgueil to be a bit more pretty, less fleshy and more structured - and typically of greater value.  The ""Les Rochettes"" is no exception, perfumed with notes of violets, sage and blackberry which leads into a palate of tilled earth, red plums, raspberries and a thread of black pepper. This medium-bodied, lifted red pairs perfectly with pork loin, mushroom based dished, and even game meats.
",Cabernet Franc
"This gorgeous example of cab franc is the perfect introduction to this special grape. The varietal is so often neglected, although a darling of the serious nerds, it rubs so many people the wrong way. Here we have this incredible vibrant example of the special grape of the right bank in it's most approachable yet authentic expression.  Vibrant earthy red fruit and only the slightest hint of greenness followed by a lovely lifted medium body. Perfect red to have around as summer bbq season starts to heat up.
",Cabernet Franc
"A great and FRESH cabernet franc that is just as affordable as it is delicious. The herbal aromas and fresh fruit make this an easy go to for any oven roasted bird.
",Cabernet Franc
"This is a truly lovely bottle of wine, whether you are accustomed to Bourgueil, or just looking for a new value red wine. The Cabernet Franc in this wine is neither harsh nor green, but rather displays soft and succulent black berry fruit with a medium body and just a hint of black pepper spice. The wine is extremely well-balanced and quite accessible right off the bat. We owe a lot here to the character and quality of the vintage, but the elegance of the wine making also contributes to the overall harmony of the wine. Try one and see why we are all so excited about this offering!
",Cabernet Franc
"I’ve been drinking “Les Rochettes” for awhile.  It’s such a great representation of Bourgueil at a killer price, but this vintage is something special.  2015 is by now well known for its warmth and ripeness across France, and it has imparted “Les Rochettes” with structure and personality like never before.  The riper phenolics highlight flavors of violets, cranberry, stewed bell peppers and herbs while the tannins provide more grip and structure, giving the impression of a wine at a much higher price-point.   If you enjoy Cab Franc, this is one value wine not to pass up.
",Cabernet Franc
"The Les Pins ""Les Rochettes Bourgueil"" has already been one of my go to wines for interesting people in Cab Franc from Loire who may not be very familiar with this varietal from this area. However in the 2015 vintage this good wine has become spectacular especially for the price. The lushness of the vintage shows itself in a more dark and bing cherry characteristic and practically no bell pepper unlike previous vintages. Although there are still lovely notes of savory herb and a touch of spice the fruit really sings in this bottle. A somewhat chewy finish compliments the medium body and makes this a fantastic everyday food wine.
",Cabernet Franc
"This old favorite is back again just in time for the holidays!  Perfect as an aperitif, a bottle to toast with or something to open for friends and family who drop by, this little bottle of bubbles is sure to please everyone!  Fresh, zippy, lively and full of finesse, this is an inexpensive gem to pick up a few bottles of so you'll always be prepared.
",Cabernet Franc
"Reading over all of the reviews for this delightful bottle of bubbly I realize that I have nothing new to add except to ditto everything that has been said about it. Is it a fantastically fun summertime bottle resplendent with notes of strawberry and citrus and a tantalizing tart taste on the tongue? In a word, yes. Basically this is a perfect little bottle to toast success, friends, BBQ's, picnics, and Monday's with. Enjoy!
",Cabernet Franc
"Perfect summer sparkler! I've recently brought this to graduation parties for a great and inexpensive gift. This brut rose has hints of strawberry and cherry and a light but crisp finish. So refreshing and for $13, how can you beat that price?!
",Cabernet Franc
"Loire buyer Eric Story has been doing his best to provide us with relatively inexpensive bubblies and in this case, he has come through. This little winner has bright red fruits, zippy acidity and a touch of minerality. Bright and refreshing. An added bonus is the tiny, tiny bubbles. Tiny bubbles, in the wine, make me happy, make me feel fine. Thank you, Don Ho!
",Cabernet Franc
"Light strawberry and citrus notes sally from this charming Cremant. Leaning more towards the tart than the sweet side of its personality, this is a refreshing, straightforward, easy going bottle of bubbly. And speaking of bubbles, the texture of this rose is one of the wines appealing characteristics, with an abundant mousse that yet manages to be silken and filigreed. Happily, it is also available a price that makes it perfect to open for any old reason at all.
",Cabernet Franc
"This bubbly is just too good and too cheap to say no to. Bright, lively and refreshing. This is a perfect sparkling to be had at anytime of the day and for any occasion. You may want to take two...
",Cabernet Franc
"A holiday pairing that sparkles, this favorite is back in stock just in time for celebrating - and works surprisingly well with the main event. Softly herbal with notes of strawberry plus delicate, teeny but exuberant bubbles, this Cabernet Franc Crémant is festive, and delicious with turkey: Deligeroy is glamour that the pilgrims only dreamed of, and still drinks beautifully year round.
",Cabernet Franc
"Tiny bubbles make me happy. Very happy. They can make you happy too! This $13 Cremant De Loire Rosé is just the ticket to add a little zip to your summer. Remarkably fresh and inviting, this sparkling wine offers sweet cherry, strawberry, and tart raspberry. The minerality, acidity, and structure of this wine is worth so much more than the price tag suggests. Give it a try today, tomorrow, and perhaps every weekend until labor day...
",Cabernet Franc
"No one's going to burst your bubble here. If you have Champagne taste on a shoestring budget, this might be the perfect antidote. With a killer price point, fun flavors of strawberry-orange, and a tart lively finish this bottle is an amazing value and super versatile. This would be the perfect choice to accompany a bucket of fried chicken, bring to a pancake brunch or just sip while binge watching Orange is the New Black.
",Cabernet Franc
"How can you not love a bottle of Bubbles from the Loire Valley that only costs $13 and tastes this good?!?!?  Loaded with tons of fresh berry fruit and copious amounts of tiny, delicate bubbles.
",Cabernet Franc
"This is one of my all time favorite Bubbly Rose and a fraction of the price of Champagne.I love the new cuvee of my Deligeroy Rose. Its much softer and more feminine that the last cuvee which was a touch herbaceous. This Cab Franc based blend is aimed to please this holiday season! Its the perfect party wine that will please a crowd instantly. Subtle fruit with balanced acid and a clean, dry finish! You wont believe your wallet! It has subtle red berry and sweet herb undertones with its racy acid and minerality keep it refreshing but still full on the palate. Perfect for any gathering or romantic date, or just sip and savor alone! Its that good
",Cabernet Franc
"This is long and fine with red cherry fruit and a persistant limestone laced finish.  There is an amazing amount of elegance and restraint showing here for only 13 bucks.
",Cabernet Franc
"Without a doubt one of my favorites sparkling rosé wines. Full of citron, wild strawberries, cherries and FUN! I recommend it for an aperitif on Valentine's day, or with the heart shaped box of chocolate! What?! It is not Valentines just yet? Just pretend, your significant other will love it!
",Cabernet Franc
"Rose with dark fruit and a very fine bubble structure for less than 15 dollars if just fine in my book. A glass of this on a sunny day while on a deck with a view would make this wine sing.
",Cabernet Franc
"Bright,fresh, clean and juicy, this is the perfect sparkler for parties or just plain enjoyment at any time. The Deligeroy Cremant Rose has a beautiful dark pink color, nice subtle berry flavors and a dry finish. All of this for a great price.
",Cabernet Franc
"This is well-balanced in the mouth and enhanced by a fresh but subtle finish. It also has tiny little bubbles, which always makes me happy! I love Cabernet Franc for sparkling wine, it has some great body and lovely fruit. For the price, buy a case!
",Cabernet Franc
"This is a perfect New Year's Eve Rose. On the nose bright cherry and strawberry aromas that carry through on the palate. The bright fresh red fruit flavors are surrounded by a more refined mouth feel. The price makes it affordable for a party.
",Cabernet Franc
"Party bubbles.  A touch darker than you'd expect.  Dark fruits fine bubbles and a crisp finish.
",Cabernet Franc
"This is the ultimate party and wedding Cremant rose of the year. It's easy on the palate, fun to drink and a great value. Nicely balanced acidity with a hint of minerality. There was even a strawberry flavor dancing in the back of my tongue...What's not to like?
",Cabernet Franc
"These Druet wines offer so much value and character for the price. The 2002 was in a perfect place in terms of age, although by no means near the end of the road. Nose of tart purple fruit, earthy pepper, soft herbaceous mint, and freshly tilled soil. The palate is surprisingly fruity despite the nose and filled with juice acid and a long silky tannin. Fabulously priced and wonderfully versatile. Just what I need.
",Cabernet Franc
"Deep color, fresh cut flowers on the nose alongside a bit of green tea, raspberries, blueberries, a touch of plum, and a good tannic structure to support all of this. The wine's depth shows even more on the palate; give it 30-45 min of air and watch the magic happen. Truly a unique and beautiful wine.
",Cabernet Franc
"The wines of Pierre Jacques Druet are difficult to find but worth the hunt.  The 2009 Chinon is earthy with notes of cedar and freshly cut fern.  It has the most structure out of the line up I tasted and has enough backbone to keep it cellared for a few more years.   There's a generous amount of red fruit and a lively quality to the wine as a whole.  An interesting, complex wine to snag at an unbelievable price.
",Cabernet Franc
"This is absolute INSANITY! These Druet wines are all ultra heady and complex, but the 2009 is truly a special wine. It's still a tiny little baby, but there's already so much life and depth. It's cleanest of the multi-vintage line-up showing the most fruit on the nose. The palate is still lively, taught and full of deep earth notes, but it's not as austere as the others. Tons of structure and tannin mean that this one is designed for the long haul. Easily one of the best values in the store and the perfect way to move from some of the bolder richer wines to the Southwest into the Loire valley.
",Cabernet Franc
"2015 Domaine des Ruettes Saumur-Champigny Rouge comes from 30 year old vines grown on clay, flint and calcareous tufa. Aged 12 months in French oak barrels (of which 25% new) it’s more robust, structured, has firm tannins and bright acidity, with earthy components. Flint soil gives it a touch of smoky notes. It’s full-bodied and rich in plum and black cassis with spicy finish. It can age nicely for another 5-7 years.
",Cabernet Franc
"This is great expression of young Cabernet Franc. It’s fruit-forward cherry-scented with touch of black peppercorns. Thanks to great conditions of 2015 vintage this wine has lovely concentration of black currants and sweet Bing cherries with low tannins and just a touch of minerality.
",Cabernet Franc
"If you like red wine with crunchy fruit, low tannin and great acidity for your mid-week meals, the Expression Saint Nicolas De Bourgueil from Joel Taluau should be at the top of your list to try. These wines go so well with simple grilled fair or even picnic food. The 2015 vintage ripeness has made this into a real crowd pleasing choice!
",Cabernet Franc
"Earthy and green with all the herbaceousness I love from Cab Franc, the 2015 L’Expression shows surprisingly rich fruit through the palate, especially for typically lighter-bodied Bourgueil, and a softer finish, with hints of violet and pepper throughout. Another lovely, interesting Taluau release at a great price.
",Cabernet Franc
"This  is a wonderful red wine with a beautiful, expressive and inviting nose. In the mouth it is lively with nice red fruit flavors that are balance out with a crisp finish. It is medium bodied with just the right amount of fruit and mineral notes. The La source Du Ruault  will go best with food.
",Cabernet Franc
"This represents all that is good and delicious about the wines of the region. Planted in the sandy and gravelly soils over the tuffeau, this powerhouse Cabernet Franc is rich, representing the depth of fruit from the 2015 vintage, but it is also full of finesse. The tannins are quite fine and the finish is long on black fruit, cedary spice and black pepper.
",Cabernet Franc
"What a standout Cabernet Franc from Anjou!  The 2015 Domaine Du Petit Clocher is supple and smooth with soft acidity and low tannin.  This is an extremely friendly wine filled with notes of wild blueberry, black plums and ripe strawberry.  It has a stony minerality and a slight woody floral note.  It's fresh and meant to be drunk young.  This wine is super easygoing and perfect to have around the house to open with a wide variety of dishes from veggie-based to poultry to steak.
",Cabernet Franc
"2015 Domaine du Petit Clocher Anjou Rouge is an amazing value and quite a gem.  This wine made entirely in stainless steel which helps to retain impeccable freshness and minerality that comes from vines grown on predominantly schist soil. It’s full of delicious berry pie notes: mix of blackberry, raspberry and blueberry. Supple, fresh, smooth and gentle, with low tannins, soft acidity, but bright and light texture it’s an incredibly elegant style of Cabernet Franc.
",Cabernet Franc
"The 2004 “Le Clos les Pins” was brimming with notes of tobacco, leather and spices. The fruit has mellowed but is ever-present, showing the classic style of the sandy and gravelly soils. This still has a long way to go.
",Cabernet Franc
"This earthy Bourgueil is rustic and Bistro ready, with all the characteristics of a classic Cabernet Franc from the region. Savory accords of allspice, umami and green olive give way to a smoky yet light palate with a complexity that only comes with age. Take it to dinner, or pair it with your own attempts at French cuisine!
",Cabernet Franc
"We’ve been working with Domaine les Pins in Bourgueil for several years now and the wines continually over-deliver for the money. On our recent visit, vignerons Philippe and Christophe Pitault-Landry were kind enough to dig some older bottles out of the cellar to show us how the wines evolve. I immediately homed in on their two 2004s—the Les Clos des Pins and Vieilles Vignes. After a little negotiating we were able to convince them to sell us a small parcel of each. The 2004 “Vieilles Vignes” Bourgueil was remarkably persistent on the palate, showing flavors of strawberries, clove and truffle nuances. It is still quite powerful in the mouth and loaded with body and texture. This could easily withstand another decade of evolution. Both are tremendous successes and demonstrate the ageability of Cabernet Franc, even from a modestly priced producer such as this.

"Gorgeous stewed red cherry, hints of leather and earth with great minerality, medium plus acidity and fine, well-integrated tannin. At $26.99, this is a crazy steal- we bought directly from the property! A must for Thanksgiving!
",Cabernet Franc
"This is a lovely, mature bottle of wine that still has plenty of vivacious refreshment left in it! Cinnamon and I had it last night with French onion soup, and this light bodied, aromatic red was perfect for the bistro fare. The 1995 Joel Taluau is classic St Nicolas De Bourgueil with plenty of green olive and herbs on the nose and great almost carnation-like earthiness in the mouth. The tannin is completely resolved, and the wine finishes fresh!
",Cabernet Franc
"I tried this recently at one of our staff tastings and I was blown away!  I always know I really like a wine when I review my notes and there are stars, plenty of exclamation points and lots of underlined words like, ""wow"" scattered about.  This wine has an incredibly aromatic nose, so much so that I wrote about it TWO different times in the margins of my notes.  2016 was a very promising vintage for Pinot Noir, which provided ripeness and concentration of aromas.  There's ripe strawberry, red cherries, candied red apples and rose.  It's balanced and has nice soft, velvety tannin and medium acidity.  I could honestly just drink this by itself and it would make a great hang out/cocktail wine, but if you're looking to pair with food it would be great with salmon, roast chicken, or even a pesto based pasta dish.    If you're ordering in this would be great with pizza or Chinese food!
",Cabernet Franc
"A sensei is a teacher (Jean-Noël practices martial arts in his spare time) and there is no better wine to teach you about the quality of Saumur fruit. More strikingly powerful, this is parcel-selected fruit that sees some time in barrel, giving it a long-lingering quality that will persist for years to come.
",Cabernet Franc
"One of the more generous offerings from Leeuwin within the string of great vintages Margaret River has enjoyed over the last decade. Sappy dark red fruits, sweet tobacco notes, exotic French oak tones. Though Suckling called this property the Mouton Rothschild of Australia last year, I might suggest this vintage is more like the Opus One of Australia! A little more dark, sweet fruit than I'm accustomed to in this bottling. A broad, dense, exotic mid-palate, plum, cassis, blackcurrant preserve. Some subtle cedar and mint notes linger reminding you this is still Margaret River Cabernet but certainly a more expansive, decadent expression of place this year without losing the structure and balance that has made this wine so legendary.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This wine is consistently great, there is a reason Leeuwin has the reputation that they do. This is the boldest, richest wine that I have had from them.  It still has that classic red fruit but it is heavier and darker, it is almost dank, in the best possible way.  The fruit is accentuated with a savory earthy, spice notes, you cannot keep yourself from going back to nose it again and again.  The heaviness of the nose is not echoed on the palate.  It is full and intense but structured and delineated.  Rich, complex, great fruit foiled by savory complexity, bold but not heavy.  This is great Cab from a Great producer and the best thing about it is drinking great now.  That was a lot of greats, and it deserves every one of them.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"I reviewed the 2012 vintage of this wine nearly a year ago and my adoration of the property has only magnified since then.  A perennial over-achiever, this gem has the chops to withstand a few decades of cellaring and at the price-point, there isn't much to compare it to.  This beauty shows classic Margaret River structure and notes of dried herbs, menthol and dark fruits.   There's a very good reason Robert Mondavi was mulling over the notion of purchasing the estate back in the '70s - as it  produces world-class wines with each passing vintage.  This one is a no-brainer.  Drink now and over the next twenty years.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Leeuwin Estates is one of Margret River’s founding wineries, and the grapes classified by the winemaker as “Art Series” worthy are only selected from the pinnacle of the estate fruit.  The sandy, loamy soils of these vineyards force the vine roots down into the fractured granite below insuring vine stress and true mineral expressions.  This terroir can only produce profound wines when paired with persistent cold winds like the ones howling off the Indian Ocean through these same Leeuwin vineyards.  The 2013 Art Series Cab greets you with boysenberry, blueberry, and eucalyptus that is decorated with the clear aromas of broken rock and thin, dusty soils.  Secondary notes of twiggy bay leaf, raspberry, and coffee percolate as you return for sniff after revealing sniff.  The palate is well structured with mid-weight tannins and an even presence through the mid palate and the ample finish.  Beautiful on its own, but I can see this wine being even more enjoyable as a partner with a meal and several glasses!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"I've been advising as many Cabernet drinkers as possible to start seriously exploring the expressions emanating from South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. The quality has gone way, way up over the last decade, but the prices have remained way, way low. Case in point is this new Reserve Cabernet from Chateau Los Boldos, a property established in 1991, but working with vines planted in the late 1940s. The reinvestment in those vineyards is realized today in the 2015 edition, one that offers classic Cabernet flavors with an eye towards the Bordeaux style. There's plenty of fruit, but also tobacco and earth, herbaceous notes, and a mineral streak on the finish that speaks to the complexity of the grape, rather than just ripeness and new oak. You get all that for well under $20. Hence, keep your eyes on South America.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"A charming bright Cabernet nose with lifted red berries and a wisp of leather and earth. It is medium bodied with slightly darker fruits than the nose would suggest. It has sneaky tannins that are polished and is lightly oaked.  This is an everyday cab that is not simple and very charming.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The nose is full of green olive, barrel spice and cassis, it gives one the sense of a powerful statement. On the palate I was surprised by the wines' balance, it has richness but excellent lift and focus with just a hint of tannins. The finish is classic Cabernet leaving a lasting flavor reemphasizing the cassis and barrel spice, quite a Chilean value.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"I love this wine! It has everything I look for: depth, precision, balance, complexity and most importantly it tastes really good. Chile is one of the many regions around the world where you get great bang for your buck and the 2015 Chateau Los Boldos Cabernet Sauvignon is a perfect example. A suave nose of mint, earth and dried herbs deftly gives way to a palate that just oozes gorgeous dark berry fruit, spice, subtle mocha notes and a touch of earth and herbs. This is a wonderful, food friendly Cabernet Sauvignon that totally over delivers given its modest price.

"Holy cow!(See what I did there) just in time for Holiday season the Jax Y3 blend is back and it is even better than I was expecting. I really enjoyed the 2014 and 2013 bottlings from our friends at Jax but this is the best one I have tasted. Beautiful cherry and spice on the nose lead to a silky, seamless palate. The wine has a lushness that never falls into jam and coats the mouth with very soft fully integrated tannins. What is so spectacular about this bottling though is the balance and freshness it delivers even as the warm red fruits are at the front of this wine. This wine is not overly rich and definitely not flabby, there is a sophistication and balance not often found in red blends at this price point here in California. A perfect bottle to have around for this time of year.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"If I owned my own California bistro, I know what my table wine would be year in and year out: the Jax Y3 Taureau. It's been one of the work horse reds of the domestic department here for the last three years and I've yet to have a bottle that didn't get the job done. A blend of 50% Merlot, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon, with the rest being Zin and Syrah, this is the PERFECT California red table wine that offers down-to-earth drinkability with a boutique level of detail and attention to care. It's a fleshy, fruit-forward wine, but it has acidity and character. It's balanced and it tastes like a more sophisticated wine than the price point would have you believe. It tastes good with everything, but is particularly suited to meats and heartier dishes, and it's so darn affordable. I love the Jackson family as well, a local member of our community, so like I said earlier: if I had my own restaurant, this would be the backbone of my menu.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Where's the love … I always overlook this Cabernet.   Always looking for the new, best, Napa red!  We opened this the other day and much to our surprise, we discovered it to be a classic –a truly balanced Napa Cabernet!  It certainly was more than approachable with the big 2014 fruit up front, alluring  blackberry jam, cocoa powder and integrated oak on the nose.  It has that great depth which lingers with the richness of black fruit.  Why not tempt yourself with that elegant, velvet juciness, melting into polished tannins, with a delightfully long finish. I was so glad to have the opportunity to try this wine!  With so many choices out there, I will not overlook this one anymore.

"I have always enjoyed the Louis Martini Sonoma Cabernet. Year after year it is possibly be the best value in California Cabernet. The step up in price for the Napa is about double but the quality is way more than that. This is a seriously delicious, rich, dense yet supple Cabernet that surprises the palate with a fleshy, toasty mouthfeel and long, lingering finish. I find the tannins silky and ripe, even with this vintage. I would have no problem enjoying this bottle now with a bit of air.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"For those who like ripeness without the jamminess, the 2014 Louis Martini Napa Valley is the perfect example of achieving phenolic ripeness without extracted, overwrought fruit. There is full ripeness without sacrificing acidity which allows the dark, purple fruit in this Napa Valley Cab to show through without overpowering and tiring out the palate.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Having been born and raised in Northern CA my introduction into wine was of course centered around Napa and Sonoma Valley reds. As much as I LOVE our Cabs and other varietals, and though there will always be a time and place for them, wines like these exist for people like me to enjoy on a daily basis. This is a fantastic expression of the varietal hitting all the right notes and senses. A case of this in my house never seems to be enough...
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is a wonderful, classic and expressive Cabernet Sauvignon for a very reasonable price. It is soft and ready, with round dark fruit flavors that help make this wine a pleasure to drink. The Hussonet drinks well alone or will go well with hearty foods.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Here is a fantastic follow up to the 2011 version of this overachiever and an amazing value.  Once again this is a wine of balance with the sweet blackberry and currant fruit  tempered by the fine tannins and fresh acidity. The husky aromatics give way to a firm , rich and earthy middle  laced with savory herb and tobacco.   The Antinori pedigree is obvious in the long, dry and detailed finish.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"While the 2011 is a tough act to follow, this 2012 absolutely brings it; actually I find the 2012 to be far better. This vintage shows a fruit quality that is more penetrating, with greater volume, persistence and length on the palate than the comparably softer 2011. Tannins, fruit and acidity are impeccably balanced, and in fact I would be hard pressed to find a Cab that is this well put together for $15-18, let alone one that comes close to this at $10. Bold statement, I know, but this Cabernet is a category killer!  This would make as nice a pairing with grilled skirt steaks this summer as it would with low oven heat, high flame pan finished rib eyes 3-4 years from now. Real Cab for a real value price. Load up.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Oddly enough about a week ago I had a customer mention that we had carried an excellent Cab that was really well priced from South America and that they wanted to get another case, I told them it was the Hussonet and unfortunately we had been sold out of it for a while and no I did not know if it would ever be back. Then yesterday Joe's ears must have been ringing because he said he had the new vintage of Hussonet to taste. That is correct, Hussonet is back! The year it has all of the same qualities that people loved in 2011 but with a little more structure and length. Leafy notes of tomato lay alongside the plum and berry notes. This is not a big juicy bomb, this is a cab that exudes structure and green notes to match the ripe fruit and is finished with silky tannins. Best of all we get to keep the $10 price tag.

"Another fantastic bottling from Opus One. I had the pleasure of trying the 2014 vintage at our Grand Domestic tasting this past Saturday. This was easily the dark horse winner of the ten wines we featured. Classic bouquet of black currant, plum, and dark cherry with subtler expressions of earth and graphite. The palate is where this wine really shines. Flavors of black currant are expressed once more, along with blackberry, savory qualities, clove, vanilla bean, and a touch of espresso. The tannins are silky and velvety; a luxurious mouthfeel all throughout. Decanting this wine will do wonders. Drinkable now; I would recommend holding for at least five more years. Will age gracefully for 20+ years

"A sustainably produced Napa Cab from a top producer that's under $55?  Believe it!  The ""Signature"" from Chappellet is just what you'd expect with inky, juicy, rich black fruit.  You get a crushed rock mineral note and a little toasted vanilla from the barrel, which comes across as subtle instead of the dominant note.  It's lush but balanced.  The structure is there, but no one part feels out of whack.  The tannin is big and ripe but feels velvety on the palate.  The acidity is vibrant and gives the wine a freshness.  The quality in fruit and wine making is apparent.  This is a superb bottle of wine and one any lover of California Cabernet should try.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This wine possesses power, concentration and refinement that would not be out of place in a $500 bottling from one of Chappellet's neighbors. The 2015 Signature, comprised of exclusively Pritchard Hill estate fruit, might be one of the best deals ever in modern Napa Cabernet. Bold, brassy saturated fruit, cassis, red and black currant, plum conserve, graphite, charred oak, cigar box and exotic spice. A rich, decadent mid-palate is balanced by classic varietal tannin and acidity that gives vitality and freshness to a concentrated and complex wine. Generosity of fruit to drink now but the stuffing to last a couple decades in the cellar. This is the real deal in Napa Cab.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This rich, flashy, dark Cabernet has all of the toasty oak and dark currant fruit to impress on the very first sip. It also has real Cabernet structure underneath with real power for your next big steak meal. If you like big cab, this is a great choice. Fire up the grill, put on some big ribeyes and enjoy this very good Cabernet!

"The search for amazing values in Napa Valley Cabernets has become an arduous task.  With so many people jumping into the lucrative game to cash in on skyrocketing prices, buyers can end up wasting a lot of dollars on subpar efforts.   Chappellet represents the opposite.  Winemaker Phillip Corallo and viticulturalist David Pro have been working together for over 25 years, and the quality of the wine they make is remarkable.  It shows deep, rich flavors of red currants, pepper, mocha, roses and cigar tobacco with velvety tannins and great acid for aging.  The balance and integration are superb, and at prices that make it a comparative steal.   This is what California wine is about.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Based on the reviews of my colleagues and Clyde himself, I had to get my hands on this wine. And instead of buying a single bottle first, I jumped right in and bought a case. I'm sure glad I did! This wine hits all the right Bordeaux tasting notes offering great balance between fruit and earthiness, acidity and tannins, making it a very approachable, every day wine for food pairing or pleasurable sipping.

"$10.99 are you out of your mind? The 2014 and 2015 sold out quickly-this will also. Another of our finds on the 2017 Bordeaux trip. Spicy, jammy, vibrant red-just like most of the 2016s. Lively and sweet with red berry flavors. A must buy. Toasty oak for $11?

"I was very impressed with the seriousness of the wine at this price range. Plum notes with a soft but nicely framed core and beautiful woodsy notes,

"This early release 2016 is filled with ripe and creamy cocoa infused cherry fruit in a smooth and enjoyable style.  This is fresh, lifted and ample for easy quaffing.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The Bordeaux region is flexing its value wine-producing muscles with this gem that is absolutely delicious and only $10.99.  It has a complex and tasty flavor profile with notes of smoky game, herbs, red fruit and licorice with a great balancing acid and nice earthy spice on the finish.  This would make for a great house wine and can proudly be shared with guests.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Big, robust, jammy and fruit forward. If you love Cab that matches Robert Parker's palate, this may be the wine for you.  From the makers of Troublemaker, here's another wine you can definitely get into trouble with, as it is very easy drinking and approachable. Paso Robles is proving once again that it's an American Viticulture Area that stands on it own.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"I preach a lot about bringing the Old World style to the New World in the form of acid and balance, but sometimes I just want some fruit! Whether I'm cooking a giant rib roast or it's 20 degrees outside, sometimes the occasion calls for something more robust and fruit-driven then the high-acid, spicy reds that typically grace my wine fridge, and that is where the Austin Hope Cab Sauv steps in! Paso Robles never disappoints when it comes to bringing the fruit, and the Austin Hope is full of copious amounts of blackberry, blueberry, plum and cocoa. Top this off with a palate that is a touch brighter than its obvious competitor and close comparison, all the while still delivering the intense, rich black fruit and mocha that big Cali Cab drinkers want and drink.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Cabernet drinkers looking for an intensely rich, decadent, and seductive Cabernet will love this wine! It is loaded with flavors of espresso bean, vanilla, blackberry jam and plums. The finish is velvety with sweet flavors of raisins and chocolate that linger. This is very much made in a style similar to Caymus Cabernet. I would say this wine even takes that style a step further. Lots of wine here for under $50!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"I never thought that I would be able to say this, but St. Estephe is the home of value for thoroughbred Bordeaux! This concentrated, even chocolaty, exotic claret  has power and dark fruit to spare. It also has a surprisingly elegant, long, dry finish and very good complexity. If you are looking for a great bargain in 2015 for the cellar, look no further!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is phenomenal wine for the price-so sweet, warm and fresh with plenty of ripe, fine tannin on the finish. Decant this tonight or lay some away for 10+ years.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The first wine we tasted on the 2016 Bordeaux trip and we loved it. In fact we preferred it to the Marquis de Calon. It has just arrived and wow is it good. These 15s are easy to drink, but they are young so decant one hour on this one. It is sweet and silky. The finish screams St Estephe.  Great balance and tremendous depth of flavor for just over $20.  Buy a case and taste it in three years.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"A good, go-to Bordeaux keeps us all happy.  Chateau Capbern of St Estephe delivers in a bright, energetic profile bursting with fresh cherries, violets, spicy notes and a skosh of mineral in the background echoes.  On the palate the cherries remain dominate, filling your mouth with a juicy, savory charisma accented with blackberry, bramble and  dark toast  on a well structured frame.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The K&L team (myself included) tasted this back at the chateau in 2016 when the wine was still being finished and about fell over ourselves, gushing about the superb quality of the 2015 Capbern (and the vintage as a whole). Now that the wine is in bottle and on our shelves, it's even better. It may seem like a shame to drink a Bordeaux this young in its youth (and the Capbern will definitely reward patience), but the wine tastes SOOOO GOOD right now. The pretty, fleshy, concentrated fruit is lush and supple on the palate and the tannins are fine, almost chewy. Not only should you buy a bottle of the 2015 Capbern because it's a great wine for a great price from a great producer, you should use it as a bellweather for the vintage. 2015 is the best Bordeaux vintage since 2009 in my opinion and the wines are fruit-forward, yet never over the top; they're approachable yet nuanced and complex. Example number one is the 2015 Capbern: the best bang for your buck Bordeaux thus far at K&L from this fantastic harvest.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Within seconds of tasting Ch. Capbern at Calon Segur on April 2nd 2016 the entire K&L team was in full agreement to buy all we could get our hands on! This is a wine of great freshness and fruit, and will be joy to drink young. A Fantastic Value! Ralph Sands
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is showing wonderfully, with lots of firm cherry and blackberry fruits, a touch of licorice and baking spice, and just a hint of smokey game. The tannins have developed perfectly so far.  It is still quite youthful and will continue to age nicely for several more years.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Another one of our beautifully matured Bordeaux's that can be had for next to nothing.  Well, for under $15 but you get the idea.  Soft, complex and showing those secondary notes from the bottle age, this wine is one of my new favorites.  Sweet dark fruit, savory, earthy and well balanced.  What more could you ask for?
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"From the portfolio of Bernard Magrez, owner of Chateau Pape Clement in Pessac-Leognan. While it might be too much to suggest that there is a ""Magrez"" style, it is true that many of his wines adopt a ""take no prisoners"" approach, combining toasty oak with a certain generosity of fruit. This 2004 Ch. La Temperance, Haut Medoc is no exception. There is a hint of age beginning to emerge on the nose here, with savory truffle notes combining with hints of roasted coffee. Plenty of sweet, ripe red and black fruits on the palate but with good underlying structure. The bright acidity and firm tannins are evident. A typical if slightly modern style Bordeaux to enjoy with tonight's dinner. Decant and enjoy!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Fully matured Bordeaux for less than fifteen bucks?  Yes, it exists.  This attractively priced, right-bank bottling is showing notes of blackcurrant, dark fruit and an undertone of that classic Medoc terroir that I can only describe as sweet-dirt.  Mmmmmm.  Go getcha some!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This may be the best deal in many, many Moons for cellared aged Bordeaux that I have seen.  Medium-deep ruby in color, the perfectly evolved aged aromas of cedar, cassis, blackberry fruit are expressive and opulent, and are highlighted by mocha and roasted coffee bean tones.  In the mouth, these wonderful aspects come across with a rich, lush, developed, viscous, complex, integrated presentation, and finishes with a long, deep, warm set of flavors. Wait a minute! How much was this Gem? $14.99? No way! We have wines that are four to five times more expensive that don’t come close to the quality of this beautifully aged Bordeaux. Clyde has suggested that this could age and improve for another ten years, and my response to that is “Why?” This Gem is absolutely delicious now and why wait at this price. Rusty has ordered me to bring home cases, upon cases of this amazing wine. Don’t Miss This! Great Value! ***** 14.0% ABV *****
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is a Bordeaux drinker dream:  A perfectly cellared wine from the owner of the legendary Chateau Pape-Clement that is approaching the magical 10 years of age and sells for a paltry 15 bucks.  This is hearty and round with oodles of dark, earthy fruit, no hard edges and soft complexity.  This rich, plump bargain is drinking perfectly right now.

"We sold out quickly last time.  Some delicious well priced 04s out there.  Try this one.

"This is the kind of wine that we search endlessly for, find rarely, and can't keep in stock when we have it.  We spend most everyday trying to find that domestic red that drinks like a cult cab but spends like a house pour.  For me, this is it - my go-to red in a generous, refined, and delicious style that doesn't hide where its from, but could also go toe-to-toe with Napa bottlings in the $40 to $60 range.  And while I've dabbled in the Wines of Substance releases before, this is probably the most impactful rendition I've tasted to date.  At $15, this will be hard to beat now and for a long time to come.  Load up.

"This wine has a lot going on for a $15 bottle! Produced by the K Vintners folks up in Washington, this wine could easily pass for double the price. Up front the wine is loaded with cassis and blackcurrant fruit, while the mid-palate is round and velvety.  There is a fair amount of grip and backbone to this wine. Really a great value!

"Oh boy does this wine have substance! This is an amazing Columbia Valley Cab for less than $15!  The palate is loaded with tons of black currant, kirsch and plum fruit with hints of smoke and subtle tobacco spice.

"This is a fantastic deal on high quality Washington Cabernet from Charles Smith's Substance line. Dark fruited with great depth of flavor, this wine would be great for a barbecue or any week night meal that calls for a bold, dry red. The 50% new French oak integrates smoky and spice elements which pairs nicely with the plum, blackberry and black currant flavors and aromas. Richly textured with elegance, this Cabernet finishes smooth with a touch of tannin and is a great near-term drinking wine.

"Loaded with tons of red fruits and a velvety texture, the 2015 Malartic is a big time winner in my book! There are hints of minerals, chocolate and spice, the wine is full and rich in the mouth, with a super long fresh finish. Tannins are ripe and integrated.

"One of the most complete ""value"" wines we tasted during our recent trip to Bordeaux, a few of us have been waiting with baited breath for this wine to release. The 2015 Malartic Lagraviere showcases the fresh, pretty, and elegant fruit of the vintage along with supreme balance of Graves minerality with added complexity from spice and earth on the finish. Alex and I had this in our top ten of the vintage. The price should get you very, very excited.

"Along with Malescot, this wine will rate as one of the great buys for 2015. Jean Jacques Bonnie has this property producing amazing wines of late.  Both white and red. This wine is 45% Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon plus a little PV and CF. Modern style but perfectly balanced with crisp acidity. Lots of Asian spice and clove on the nose. Earthy blackberry fruit flavors. A winner for sure.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"I don't usually think of Toscana red blends as luscious but the Pepita is one luscious wine.  A warm vintage pushes this multi-varietal blend towards international styling but never loses sight of its Tuscan roots.  Vibrant and clean flavors of Maraska cherries, crushed herbs and savory spices lead to a subtly mouthfilling wine that has polished tannins and a sweet lingering finish.  The acid structure keeps it all together and says, I am Italian!  This is probably one of my favorite Ferrero wines to date for its shear accessibility and pleasure to drink with food.  Give me a Bistecca alla Fiorentina to go with this bold and delicious red.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"A baby ""Super Tuscan"" and a terrific everyday drinker.  This is crammed with dark cherry fruit, earth and spice in a bold and ripe style that will appeal to wine drinkers off all stripes.  Buy this easy to drink and food friendly wine by the case.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Don't be confused with the tasty, dried pumpkin seeds found in most natural foods aisles, this wine is named after Pepita, the daughter of the late, great Pablo Harri and his wife Claudia Ferrero, an accomplished winemaker in her own right. Graced with a unique blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Montepulciano and Alicante, each undergoing separate fermentation in stainless steel tanks before aging for a  year in barriques, this youthful, vigorous blend possesses lavish aromatics and arresting flavors of black cherry, plum, potpourri, spice and leather, with a nice structure to the lengthy, polished finish. So much wine, so little time!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is one of those occasions when the sum is better than its parts. That's not to say that the single varietal wines were not great on their own, but the blend that comprises 'Pepita' is a real stunner. We normally expect a wine of this depth and quality to hit the floor above $20 so it's no surprise why it comes with our highest recommendation. This is a real super Tuscan.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"If you're looking for a great little rosso for everyday drinking, this is an excellent choice! I love the value and complexity of this wine. It hits all the classic Sangiovese notes--cherry, sandalwood, earth and perfect structure--while being totally open and ready to drink. This is the wine you want to drink on your weeknight, or with a good crew of friends while you're waiting on your Brunelli to age.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This wine is incredibly bold; the nose just explodes out of the glass, layers of cassis, followed by waves of complex pomegranate, plum, and wild cherry while spiced with bits of leather, earth and Tuscan dust. The texture is voluptuous; full-bodied it fills your mouth yet is surprisingly fresh and balanced. On the palate the cassis and pomegranate meld into one, vibrant, focused, saturated flavors, that leads into more spice as the fine grain tannins weave a powerful yet elegant structure.  This is a powerful wine, it has the balance, density and length of a wine 2-3 times in price, yet because there is no other Tuscan blend just like this it lacks a category for critics to bother reviewing…that’s all for your benefit, you pay much less! Try it you’ll find this is a truly exceptional wine.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"From our friends at Ferrero (Claudia Ferrero & Pablo Harri) husband & wife team, they have hit another one out of the proverbial ballpark. This is a Super Tuscan ( Merlot, Cabernet, Montrpulciano  & Alicante), on the palate you will find a dark, brooding profile of Tuscan dust, smoke, wild cherries and underbrush, with plenty of dark fruit that carries through to the finish. There is outstanding depth here (2015 Structure!!!), not to mention terrific overall balance with soft supple tannins. Just the thing for cheese filled pastas.

"Every year one of the wines I look most forward to tasting is Cantemerle. Always affordable and a perennial overachiever given its price this is a wine I always anxiously await to taste. The 2015 Cantemerle does not disappoint, this is a stunning value and loaded with pretty berry fruit and spice with hints of earth and mineral notes. Silky tannins and a long finish make this a worthy rival of both the 2009 & 2010 vintages.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This could be for me the greatest value wine of the vintage. (Under $30). IT is so sweet and lush on the palate, but it also has tremendous depth and structure. Blackberry aromas and flavors-silky texture. Long and lingering on the palate-tasted three times and it was great each time. As good as the 2010 was, this may be a touch better-more polished. We sold over 8000 bottles of the 2010 ($37-$47)-we will sell that much of this beauty. A must buy.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Our entire team loved this wine and a 13% increase in price is very reasonable number for what might be Bordeaux greatest value. Great nose and taste of effusive black fruits with hints of earth, chocolate and wood all beautifully balanced! Loved it!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"I tasted this wine on 3 separate occasions during our week in Bordeaux and loved it every time. Aromatic and wonderfully fresh, crisp fruit that is nearly silky in the mouth; Tannins are ripe and sweet with a long lingering finish. This is a wine to buy for sure!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Just a gorgeous wine both on the nose and on the palate. There's a ruby red core of sweet fruit and secondary flavors of rose petals and mineral notes that add complexity to that ripeness. A stunner and another notch in the ever-lengthening belt of Cantemerle's successes. Sure to be the staff favorite once the wine arrives two years from now. Make sure you get in early.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Hard to believe it's been almost 8 years since the outstanding 2010 vintage, but it is, this wine is aging beautifully. The cocoa and sweet plums are joined by the gentle and round tannins. The woodsy notes are not quite yet forest floor, but it is there, and make this wine irresistible for me.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"A fabulous value from the great 2010 vintage.  It is showing beautiful right now.  Lots of cinnamon and clove on the nose that follows to the palate. First time we had ever tasted this property and we said 100 cases for sure.  As good as $40 wines out there and it has structure to age for several years. One of the great value 2010s that shows more fruit than tannin.

"Very sweet and lovely texture.  Elegant wine.

"For as long as I’ve worked at K&L, I’ve been consistently wowed by how much Cabernet these wines deliver for the dollar and I was reminded again of that qualitative bargain this past week while tasting the recent 2015 vintage: yet another example, loaded with dark fruit, fine tannins, and real California grit, yet without all the fancy marketing and exaggerated hype. Simply put, it’s a Cabernet for people who like to drink real Cabernet. Made with 30% estate-grown fruit near St. Helena, it’s a blend of 90% Cabernet with 10% Merlot just to soften the edges a bit and bolster some of that fruit character.The best part about the Buehler Cabernets (on top of the quality and the price) is the fact that you can age them for another decade or drink them now with some decanting. Buehler is one of the true family-owned gems of the Napa Valley, a winery that for almost three decades has been producing honest expressions from its 300 acre hillside estate just above Conn Valley. The prices remain reasonable from vintage to vintage because producing value-oriented wines is part of Buehler's philosophy. In an era where getting the most money for your bottle has become commonplace in Napa, it's refreshing to find a bit of that throwback mentality.

"When tasting almost a hundred wines a week, it’s pretty hard to be blown away, but the first time I tasted the Taken Cabernet Sauvignon, I was floored at the quality and balance of the wine, and then I was left speechless when they told me the price! Right out the gates you are met with aromatics of black cherry, red plum and dark chocolate. The palate is plush and full bodied, with a nice balance between ripe fruit, integrated tannins and balanced acidity. This wine isn’t for those faint of heart, though, because there is plenty of grip and structure that stands up to even the big boys in Napa Valley!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Great nose of deep cassis; a bouquet blend of floral and fruit notes, mainly led by plum. On the palate, everything about this wine is so well integrated. The tannins are soft, but the liquid has a nice little grip to it. Flavors are just as beautiful as the nose. At this price, it's a no-brainer.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The 2014 Red Blend from Taken Wine Company is a bold, yet well balanced red with nice flavor profiles of dark stone fruit, and tobacco.  The finish is smooth and velvety. A fantastic buy for the red blend lover.

"Taken is a lovely blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot that's full bodied and would be delicious paired with easygoing dishes like barbecued ribs, pizza or burgers.

It's soft and supple with a light, granular tannin that appears late on the palate, which adds another layer of complexity to the wine.

"Under $10 with a screw cap enclosure, this wine blows away most Cabs in the $20-$30 range.

The price on this Cabernet is a blessing. Buy a case and keep your friends away from your expensive wines this holiday season.

"This is not good Cab for $10, it is a good Cab, period. This has been one of my favorite bottles for the past 3 years, each vintage getting better and better. Sourced from 30-year-old vines, this Cab has the stuffing that can only come from older vines. Medium bodied, with notes of blue fruit and bramble on the nose, followed by a softly textured and layered palate. Perfect for parties, delivers amazing Cabernet value that we rarely see here from California.

"The best Cabernet Sauvignon under $10 that I have tasted in nearly 9 years of working here. Serious stuff, with a mouthful of currant and blue skinned fruits, just a trace of that savory, snappy green quality which good Cabernet, picked just at the point of ripeness and not past it, will show. Complexity? Check. Fruit? Check. Fair price? Big check. Load up on this cab - you'll be glad you did!

"Margaret River Cabernet has quickly become my go-to for incredibly well done and affordable Cabernet. Often this region can showcase the beauty of New World fruit with Old World sensibilities. That is to say, beautiful rich full-bodied fruit backed by longer, leaner, casking. The Clairault White Label shows just this style beautifully. Lovely ripe black and red berry are tinged with savory herb and tobacco on the nose. On the palate, there is definitely plenty of tannin and structure, yet the finish manages to stay elegant on the finish. A perfect wine for a big meal and good times.

"The baby brother to Clairault's (Black Label) Estate Cab this sibling won't easily be outdone. Sharing many of the flagship's traits - juicy dark fruit, bay leaf, tobacco, mint, fine tannin and notable length - this is serious Cabernet for the money. Sourced from Clairault's estate holdings and some neighboring vineyards, this little guy packs some serious bang for the buck. If you like Cabernet from a more moderate to cool climate (think Bordeaux / Santa Cruz Mountains) this wine is more than worthy of your attention. Clairault is a new direct import for us at K&L and you can see the staff are already raving about them. Top value.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Margret River Cabernet is the gold standard on the continent for refined expressions and Clairault is a champion of that superior style.  The white label wines are a good entry point into the Clairault lineup of wines and the 2014 cab delivers on their promise. Blackberries and spice pour out of the glass and the bouquet develops clarity with each inviting sniff: dried cherry, bay leaf, potpourri, hints of tar and a dusty earthiness all jockey for attention.  On the palate the wine continues its bold features with a round yet balanced presence that includes medium weight tannins and the introduction of cassis in the fruit profile.

"If you are looking for an affordable, quintessentially Margaret River Cab Sauv, look no further than this guy. It shows the classic hints of  stemmy, woodsiness many of the Cabs from this area carry, and that is a great thing. These are unique wines and an incredible value from a well-loved estate. Still tasting pretty young, I believe this one to have great aging potential. Well deserved of its 94 point score, Clairault Cabs should be on you radar if they are not already.

"Intense nose with concentrated dark fruits, tapenade, bay leaf and a hint of eucalyptus.  The nose is impressive, inviting and complex.  Ripe and rich entry with round mouth filling polished tannins with just a hint of oak.  The dark fruits are back with a brighter berry nose as well as tapenade and muted herbal notes.  What a deal!

"I love it when an Old World producer decides to make wines in the New World region of Napa. I don't always personally love the wines, but I always appreciate the injection of traditional styles, philosophies and practices into a youthful and eager to learn region. The Antica cab from Antinori is that clear cut example of how a family so steeped in Old World traditional can make a New World wine with such deft and balance. This Napa Valley cab that comes primarily from Atlas Peak is the perfect harmonious marriage between the formality and restraint of wines made in a cooler and less than forgiving region, with the approachability and wide-eyed eagerness of energetic California cabs. The Antica cab is brimming with black cassis, plum, graphite and a subtle mineral note on the nose. The first impression on the palate upfront is weighty and full bodied, but the prominent structure and acid profile keep this cab from being soft and flabby and give it surprising shape and lift.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Antica Cabernet is the flagship wine from the Antinori project in the Napa Valley. The 2013 is just delicious! Savory herbs, ripe cassis flavors with a lush velvety texture, this wine is just touched with toasty oak. The finish is long and sweet. Being mountain fruit, there is a fair amount of structure and density to this wine, but it shows surprisingly open and fleshy. Enjoy now!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Antica is a property owned by the famous Antinori family. Their family has been making wine for six hundred and thirty years and have always held the highest standards of wine making. Their latest release of Cabernet Sauvignon is no exception. A touch of brown sugar and plentiful blackberries can be found upon first approach. The palate offers bright cherries and herbs, velvety tannin and nice minerality. A soft refined finish is complemented by a chalky almost ash like characteristic that is a testament to the grapes and terrior.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The Antica Napa Valley label comes to us from the Antinori family, famed for their bold and expressive Italian winemaking. This is reflected in the style and presentation of the 2013 Napa Valley Cabernet, which is structured very much like a classic Italian wine: dry, with firm tannin, earthy spice and graphite notes. The vineyards of Antica are located high on Atlas Peak, and they are planted on predominately western-facing volcanic slopes. It's no wonder ashy minerality is the standout characteristic of this wine, which sets it apart from the typically fruit- and oak-dominated Napa Valley Cab.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This 2013 Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon comes from the people at Antica, Marchese’s Antinori’s California venture. With over 600 years of winemaking experience under their belt, this wine shows both influences from their Old World roots to New World influences exemplified from the terroir and climate of Atlas Peak. Initial aromas of charred and grilled fruit, especially plum. Blackberry sauce and roasted green bell pepper round out the nose. On the palate, ripe blackberry is complimented by a noted mineral quality and espresso flavors. Supple tannins leave the wine with an elegant finish. For a Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon under $50, this wine delivers.

"**Don’t Miss** Classic, firm and intense with brooding dark fruits, brambly blackberry, coffee, and scorched earth. Excellent depth and old vine clarity.  Solid.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This wine is always good and this year it is a big, rich, powerful Cabernet dominated wine. Creamy, red currant aromas and jammy black currant and licorice flavors. Lush on the palate with plenty of tannins at the back end. Like the huge 2010, this one needs time. Great value always and about 1/2 the price of their 2009. Production down here so the wine is highly allocated in Bordeaux.  We will run out so act quickly.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The nose on this is amazing! Roses, black cherry, tobacco and minerals with nice aged savory elements.  The fruit is fresh on the palate, with enough acid and restraint to make it the perfect food claret.  This is THE deal in sub $20 claret at the moment.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This wine is a beauty. The garnet color with some lighter tinges tells us this wine is developing nicely, and very much ready to drink. It has an appealing, sweet fruit note on the nose, but isenveloped by even more enticing woodsy, cocoa and violet notes. It has a medium body, with present but caressing tannins. Above all it is a fresh and classic Bordeaux for the table. I don’t usually talk about the prices, as I find it is up to the consumer to decide if it is a good value, but in this case I have to point out that this is a great opportunity to buy, and buy by the case.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The 2007 is a softer, more forward version of the 2009. There is a lovely floral lift to the nose. Good ripeness was achieved here. There is plenty of bright, sweet black fruit on the palate and surprising weight and richness. Offered at a significant price reduction to the ’09, this is a superb example of an affordable, everyday red.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"I love the nose on this wine – singing with raw, wild honey and dark coffee, but it’s the palate that really shows off the cooler 2007 vintage with dark berry fruit, hints of violet, and a structure that’s more linear than lush. Medium tannins show up at the finish but subtly grip without being overbearing. Château Malescasse is a delicious and surprisingly complex Bordeaux, especially given the stellar price.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Here is an amazing bargain approaching 10 years of age and priced to buy by the case.  This is very expressive  with effusive aromas and flavors of  raspberry and rhubarb fruit along with cedar chest and cigar box.  Bargain hunters need to taste this crisp, fruity and very complex beauty.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"A perfect score for value Bordeaux to enjoy tonight.  This overachieving property makes great wines most any year and 2007 is no exception.  I love 2007 Bordeaux-much like 1997 with 10 more years of winemaking expertise.  This wine has some violets on the nose and palate. Perfumey and toasty aromas lead to the palate.  Some licorice too.  53% Cab and 37% Merlot with some PV and Cab Franc thrown in.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"A rich, elegant, high-toned wine from the classic 2010 vintage, the Brillette is a serious overachiever in its category, imbued with a judicious, savory blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. It offers a lovely bouquet of seductive ripeness and textural, mouthwatering layers of dark cherry, black plum, blackcurrants and mineral earth, with fine tannins and a fairly opulent finish. Drink or hold for six more years.

"This is dark and generous with black cherry fruit, vanilla and toast layered through the firm middle.  The sleek, sweet finish has hints of clay, touches of mineral and plenty of tannin.  Shows the power of the vintage so decant.

"The newest Kalinda Rutherford Cabernet is reflective of the 2015 vintage in Napa, which was defined by a warmer growing season and an early harvest. This led to low yields of very high quality fruit with great power and concentration. This elegant Cabernet is rich and condensed, with silky, dusty tannins and classic Rutherford aromas and flavors of bright Bing and black cherry, tobacco leaf and allspice. The quality and drinkability of this wine is undeniable, and finding a Rutherford Cabernet at this price point is next to impossible.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The value here is ridiculous; I will be getting a case for myself to enjoy and see how it comes of age. This is the most fulfilling cab in this price point I have ever encountered. Absolutely delicious to the very last drop. Big, full, and structured. The only downfall being that the bottle is only 750 ml.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is an elegant Cabernet from the Napa Valley. It is smooth, balanced and just the right amount of fruit. I love those dusty tannins. This is the true mark of a Rutherford red wine.All this for $27.99!

"Here is a Cabernet Sauvignon to keep handy this summer and through the rest of the year, frankly. There is plenty of juicy red fruits but the kicker for me is the freshness, the energetic acidity, sweet spices,  supple tannins and overall structure that keep me reaching for the bottle. I usually lean in the opposite direction for my wines at this time of the year but it seems I've been swayed to the other side. And I love it.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Deep color and cassis tones introduce what is an unmistakable profile in Napa terroir. Cocoa powder and soil tones fill in as the wine airs, but the virtue is that the savor is from that terroir; not the stilting of heavy new wood which can be difficult to differentiate in this day and age. But perhaps my favorite characteristic here is the focused juiciness driving into the finish that really makes you want to take another sip. As much as a wine like this could age, in its fresh voluptuousness I actually think there is plenty of virtue to drinking it young. There's an uncommon combination of concentration and drinkability to this wine that really floats my boat.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is my new “go-to” summer red! The aromas of black cherry and cassis jump from the glass and are followed by hints of cassis, plums, mocha and blueberries. The wine is fresh and does not come across as heavy. This will pair perfect with your summertime grilling and comes across as a $50+ bottle!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is an outstanding rendition of Kalinda Cabernet Sauvignon! I am really glad Clyde & I waited and tasted and waited and tasted because our patience has truly been rewarded upon tasting this wine once again from bottle. Beautiful aromas of spice, baker's chocolate and crème de cassis spring from the glass while on the palate the wine feels electric with intense red and black cherry flavors as well as milk chocolate and mocha notes. Velvety tannins and a long, supple finish only add to the enjoyment this plush Cabernet Sauvignon provides. If there's a better Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon for under $30 I haven't tasted it yet.

"Produced by one of the oldest established Cabernet estates {and we cannot tell you who it is} in Napa Valley, which had its first crush in 1882, this absolutely astounding wine is deeply colored and offers opulent, powerful aromas of cassis, currants, blackberries, and violets, all of which is underscored by cedary, creamy, and dusty (Rutherford dust, of course!} qualities. This carries over fabulously to a broad, viscous, concentrated, yet integrated palate impression that offers excellent complexity, depth, balance, and richness. The finish is long, warm, and elegant. Although you can drink this Gem, with decanting and an hour or so of airing, currently, it will age easily another ten-plus years, which Rusty and I plan to do. Rusty wants me to bring home several cases of this amazing Gem and thinks that you need to give some serious consideration in doing the same. A GREAT VALUE! .....A K&L WINE MERCHANTS' EXCLUSIVE..... ***** 14.5% ABV *****

"What a delicious Cabernet we have for all Cabernet and Bordeaux lovers.  Coming from the very warm 2015 Napa harvest, this wine is quite elegant and refined already. Just the right amount of oak here and plenty of red currant aromas and flavors. Rutherford is home to some of the most famous Napa Valley producers--a few who have been around for many years (way before Prohibition). We can't tell you who made this wine, but I think if you really think about it, you may pick the right property.  The old and famous Pot Luck Restaurant in the East Bay featured many of their wines on its extensive wine list. Wines back to 1893! Please decant this wine as it is a baby and enjoy it with a rack of lamb.  Very similar to the fine 2003 Bordeaux wines in structure and richness.

"Over the past few vintages, the style of the Montelena Cab has waivered ever so slightly. But I rejoiced with happiness when I tasted the 2014 and realized that the classic Montelena is back! The aromatics couldn't be more classically Napa. Dark cassis, blackberries and red plum marry perfectly with the sophisticated yet structured mouthfeel. At less than $50, you can't find a more refined and polished Napa Valley Cab.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Sticking to its roots, the Chateau Montelena Napa Cabernet is a balanced, fresh, well rounded Cabernet that doesn’t hit you over the head with a big dose of sweet vanilla oak. The fruit, oak and tannins are all working together in this wine. Flavors of red cherries, strawberries, cedar and plum jump from the glass, while the finish is firm but not harsh. This is a great wine to enjoy now with a steak or any other red meat dish and should age quite well over the next 5-10 years.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Best winery in Napa, year after year, and this is yet another perfect example as to why. Energetic aromas of plum, wild blackcurrant, pencil shavings, and mint jump out of the glass. On the palate, this Cabernet has plenty of structure: balanced acid, ripe tannins, and lively, but not forward, fruit flavors. All crucial parts of the equation that lead to a beautiful, balanced wine with lots of terroir that will age delicately. All this for one of the more competitive prices for the area.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"2014 is really starting to show itself as a fantastic vintage for Napa Cabernet, and the Calistoga Cabernet Sauvignon from Chateau Montelena is a great example. Packed with flavors of plum, dark cherry, tobacco, and leather, the 2014 Vintage is a classic text book example of what a Napa Cab should taste like and it helped remind me why I even fell in love with the varietal many moons ago, and just under $50 bucks, it also proves to be a fantastic value as well. Definitely worth a whirl, if you're looking for a nice cab to bring to dinner with you.

"The 2013 Burgess ""Estate"" Cabernet Sauvignon is undoubtedly one of the best values in Napa Cabernet at K&L. Consisting of all-estate fruit from the family-owned Burgess property on the east-facing side of Howell Mountain, this wine shows no lack of depth or power. Brimming with dark fruit and spice, this wine has a great deal of structure and a firm, tannic backbone that make it ideal for aging or drinking with a richer meal. 2013 was considered an early, even and excellent vintage in Napa Valley, and this wine reflects that in its balance and drinkability.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is a crazy deal for Napa Cabernet from Howell Mountain. Burgess, established in 1972, was one of only a couple dozen wineries in Napa Valley at the time. This winery has a long history with winemaking and it shows in this bottle of Cabernet. The concentration of dark fruits, rustic notes and herbal characters make this red interesting and approachable. On the mid-palate there is some grip but then finishes with fine tannins. This is delicious now, but certainly can age for a decade!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This fantastic 2013 from the Burgess estate is a great bottle of full bodied, yet dry Napa Cabernet. If you are looking for a dark fruited, powerful mountain cab to go with some man sized rib eyes off the grill, look no further. While most Napa Cabernet in this price range is made from purchased valley floor fruit, this is entirely from the Burgess estate on Howell Mountain. Enjoy some now, and save some for a few years... I just drank a bottle of the 1993 a few months ago and it was still fresh at 24 years old!

"I was incredibly impressed by the Burgess Estate 2013 in our tasting today, in fact it was my favorite out of the 25 California wines we tried.  A beautiful showing of deep dark and intense fruit and lovely spice with smooth medium tannins and a long concentrated and  intense finish.  It's a great example of classic high end Napa Cab from a fantastic vintage, and at this price is a true bargain.

"This property always flies under the radar and is becoming one of my favs from the region. I much prefer their red to their white. We have sold over 1000 cases of this and we just got a bit more. 2009 is my favorite vintage since 1945.. I have a case of magnums in my cellar.  That means you should buy some.  Decant one hour.  Sweet and sexy. Re-tasted on 12/10/17-so good it is sinful.  Sweet and round-no edges-all fruit.

",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This Pessac-Léognan is a remarkable effort, and for sure one of the best wines I have tasted this year, so far. It is full bodied, and not shy on the palate, with beautiful notes of truffles, plums, coffee, currant jam, espresso beans and mocha. Outstanding.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"I tasted a barrel sample of this wine last September and I was blown away! Saffredi is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot but grown along the Tuscan coast. The hallmark of the 2015 vintage for me is the sweet fruit purity is totally evident, the fruit just sings, ripe yet focused, complex and really engaging. On the palate the wine is bold, rich yet not fat, it has superb balance and length, the fruit character is so complex yet open at the same time a revelation. The finish is fresh, lifted and just seems to go on forever, a hint of toastiness now but that will age out by the time the wine is bottled and released, a fabulous wine!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Did someone say this was an off vintage?  This bottle of wine would argue otherwise!  The structure and balance are definitely up-to-par with other Tronquoy offerings.  It has a very pretty nose with soft red fruit, a touch of pepper and  great ripeness with balancing acidity.  This will continue to age gracefully for years to come.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"2007 was a challenging vintage in many ways, cool and humid throughout much of the spring and summer. Thankfully, September and October were hot and dry and conditions during harvest were ideal. The best wines offer ripe, sweet fruit and fine tannins, and will make for very good near-term drinking. They are attractively priced, often at a steep discount. Compare the 2007 Tronquoy-Lalande, St-Estèphe $27.99 to the much heralded 2009, for example, which sells for $39.99. It won't require another decade in the cellar and is drinking very well right now. It is, in fact, aging a bit precociously, already showing some intriguing savory notes with hints of truffle and licorice, even at ten years of age. It still retains its youthful fruit, however, with notes of tart red cherry and fresh-picked blackberry. There is a lovely weight and ripeness here, and a positively silky texture along with very fine tannins. The blend is 58% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, and 12% Petit Verdot.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This wine is right now drinking beautifully. The tannins softened providing for a silk palate, with cherry and plums notes along a  coffee and spice touch.

"I love Tronquoy's Merlot heavy St Estephe style. Leafy, mineral driven red fruit, subtle licorice and earthy underbrush. The palate shows great structure, lovely acid driven style that just keeps you wanting more. Some gravelly notes, but more on the red fruit and leafy earth. Medium bodied but with a long subtle finish. Awesome example of cool vintage merlot and how fab it can be. A reminder that you should always buy the chateau not just the vintage.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The 2007 Tronquoy Lalande is a powerful, structured Bordeaux that pairs very well with rich, charcoal grilled steak and loaded potatoes! This wine, which I enjoyed a couple of Fridays ago for steak and claret night has an exotic, open, mocha and cassis nose as well as plenty of back end grip. This is manly Bordeaux for a manly steak, and should be even better in a few years time.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"A great value property run by the Montrose people. We love 2007 like 1997, but 2007s are better. Red berries, licorice, flowers and spices on the nose. Supple and sweet.

"2015 one of the best vintages on record, makes it easy to buy wines at this price range. They are for the most part very approachable, and yet can certainly age if you wish. Haut-Vigneau is a perfect example. Nice primary fruit core right now, but with a nice structure framing it. Drink it now or cellar for some more years.

"California is on the map for these big, beautiful, muscle, Cabernets!  Still in its youth, this 2014 is going to be something special.  Unbelievable, the nose gives off at least twenty different flavors and aromas.  To name a few, look for blackberries, cocoa, coffee, wood spice and tobacco.On the palate, a vibrant nose of supple, rich blackberries kick of acidity.  Yet It is not just fruit and alcohol, the tannins seem almost restrained for a wine of this magnitude.  Not for the faint of heart, the deep ruby color lures and mesmerizes,  at the same time trying to explain what keeps you reaching for more.  Match with that t-bone sizzling on the grill.

"I'll never forget the first time I tasted Faust. It was at The Martini House (a once landmark restaurant in St Helena) and it was part of their mid-week burger special; a glass of Faust Cab and a burger for $16. What was amazing wasn't the ridiculous bargain price but how superbly the Faust paired with their rich, fatty, unctous burger. One of the main principles of food pairing is to match styles; light with bright, earthy with savory; acidic with tart; and unctous with rich. And that was exactly what the Faust Cab brought to the table in order to go toe-to-toe with their monster burger. The 2014 hasn't changed much since, and this 2014 is intensely fragrant right off the bat. Deep aromatics of currant, plum and bitter chocolate waft immediately from the glass and prepare you for a palate brimming with luscious  blackberry and black cherry. The kicker at the end is the surprising acidity and structure that help keep this concentrated and full-body Cab able to pair with every occasion and robust meal you choose to throw at it!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"A big Napa Cabernet with loads of personality at an affordable price point. The aromas are intensely deep and flaunt blackberries, plum, and spicy blackcurrant. The tannins are fleshy and satisfying, which pair nicely with the balanced acidity. A touch of vanilla on the palate opens the road for a long and smooth finish. A great bottle to put down and watch develop or to enjoy now with a nice juicy steak or burger.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Faust has always been a special wine to me, as it was one of the first wine labels I really got into during my early days of working in the wine industry in Napa Valley. The 2009 and 2010 vintages of Faust were my go-tos, whenever I got invited to dinner parties and occasional barbecues. While I haven't had the last several vintages, I am delighted to say that Huneeus Vintners is at it again, with the 2014 vintage of Faust, a full-bodied Cabernet packed with intense flavors of blackberries, plum, and black cherry. Ripe and heavily concentrated, the 2014 Faust is a perfect wine for the holidays for the Cab lover on your shopping list.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is easily one of the best sub-fifty dollar values on the market right now – a wine that Robert Parker described as “deep, wonderfully fruited, rich and savory…” He later admitted after tasting Faust along with Quintessa that it was “probably the best set of wines [he had] yet tasted from the Huneeus family…”  Frankly, it’s tough not to believe such a statement after tasting it and knowing that virtually all of the fruit comes from AVAs such as Rutherford, Coombsville, Atlas Peak, Mount Veeder or St. Helena – some of Napa’s most prized valley and mountain terroirs.  It’s a beautifully layered, unctuous wine and an absolute steal for the money.  In a climate where your entry level Napa cab is hovering within the fifty dollar price point, you should take a hard look at Faust, as most wines in this category simply lack the acclaim and raw materials to compete with it.

"Hall made the scene, so to speak, with their RP95 Napa Cab in 2008 and quickly became one of the great go-to value Cabs on the market.  But what is more exciting is the overall jump in quality at the winery to rival some of Napa's greatest wines.  I think that is the story with the 2013 Napa Cab more than any score that's been put on it.  Straight out of the bottle there's pure cassis and vanilla aromas.  The palate is very soft with explosive red and black fruit, well-integrated tannins, and a string of acidity that carries an impressive finish.  I would decant now for 2-4 hours or leave in a cool cellar for five years, but I'm sure those that see this to maturity will have a gem in their collection that will defy the sub-$50 price-point.  For those looking for a sweet spot wine in 2013 Napa Cabernet, it doesn't get much better than this.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This rich, smooth and creamy wine is classic Napa Valley floor through and through.  Oodles of plush and sweet fruit smother the ripe tannins as this glides across your palate. Go ahead and decant but don't feel you need to wait on this in-your-face and approachable bottling. Lovers of Caymus take note.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This young, age-worthy Cab certainly needs a few years to develop, but after an aggressive decant (2+ hours) some lovely dark fruit/dark berry, toasted almond and cocoa notes really start to jump out of the glass.  On the palate, black currant, dried cherry, licorice and mocha.  Follow this wine (and production) over the next five to ten years and prepare to be impressed.

"2013 was a great vintage in Margaret River, evident in this Cabernet Sauvignon from Xanadu. The nose is bright and expressive. Deeply minty and herbal with some mustard grass notes. Layered with rich, supple dark fruit like cassis and boysenberry as well as hints of mocha. On the palate, big, chewy, and spicy. Dark fruit shines, with mint and herbs present in addition to a tinge of subtle chocolate. Delicious on its own or with herb-roasted lamb

"Really drinkable, rich and complex Cabernet.  This wine has something for almost everyone.  Polished round tannins that create rich and supple mouth feel.  Bright fruit that is accented with dusty earth, and subtle oak spice and a eucalyptus high note for those that crave layers to their wines. The wine has plenty of immediate charm and enough stuffing for the collector.  All for under $25, if you like Cab, you have to try it.

"Wow, the nose on this is gorgeous: with notes of cedar and wet earth, the 2013 Xanadu Estate is reminiscent of walking through a forest, but with the addition of that distinctly Australian eucalyptus hit. Fruit is on the darker side and concentrated, and while this is rich and gutsy, there is restraint, with super soft tannins on the finish. Dusty and drinkable, Xanadu feels more expensive than its price implies, making this a perfect party pick. An old world-style stunner with modern sensibility, this is a spicy, sophisticated Margaret River Cabernet Sauvignon that would make Olivia Newton John proud.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"I strongly and passionately feel like Australia is the future of cabernet sauvignon, mainly because it has all the youthful drinkability that California wine lovers appreciate, but with the complexity and depth that we have generally have to wait for with Bordeaux. Because of that dichotomy, the best wines from Margaret River are often compared to the top growths of the Medoc, but as you can see with the Xanadu Estate cabernet here the prices are much, much more affordable (like a fraction of what fine Pauillac would run you). I've tasted this wine about five separate times now and each time I've been taken aback by the concentration of fruit and the subtle accents of earth, spice, and leather. The wine is silky, yet nuanced. It's polished, but in no way sweet or overtly airbrushed. It's just a slam dunk bottle of cab with style and gusto, from a serious plot of land, for a reasonable price, and with a screw cap to boot. It's everything I love about Australian wine right now: panache without pretense.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"My fetish for Margaret River Cab lives on, thanks to our Aussie Buyer, Ryan Woodhouse. The wines have such a distinctive nose, are not unlike Bordeaux in style and flavor, and have excellent aging potential. The Xanadu is full of notes like cassis, plum, dark cocoa and eucalyptus. There is plenty of the same on the palate, with the addition of baking spices, pepper and gentle tannins towards the finish. There is a lot going on here that makes it ready to enjoy now but it can hang in your cellar for a few more years too. Frankly, at this price you'd be crazy not to stock up with bottles for the upcoming grilling season (which is now, in Southern California) or for that milestone birthday BBQ or pot roast dinner in a few years time.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Holy cow. Such an awesome expression of cabernet sauvignon in a true Margaret River style: medium + body, menthol, black fruits, cassis, a hint of white pepper, ripe tannins, and plenty of acid.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Margaret River has been on an absolute tear with great vintages coming thick and fast. The wines often strike a stylistic balance somewhere between Napa Cabernet and Bordeaux but retain their own unique markers at the same time. The fruit is typically rich and concentrated like Oakville; the tannins and poise more reminiscent of Paulliac; the complex aromas of cedar, crushed mint and sandstone are uniquely Margaret River. The quality of these wines hasn’t gone unnoticed and huge point scores are amassing! The 2013 Xanadu Estate Cabernet is a slightly more generous, lush style of Cabernet from Margaret River. Saturated dark fruits, blackcurrant, ripe plum, dark chocolate, sweet oak spice and fine broad tannins. Incredible concentration; fantastic value! We bought every case that was available to us as it was just too good to miss at this price!

"A truly delicious Cab from a hallmark Margaret River producer. This really is a great value for this complex yet highly approachable wine. It has the structure and earthiness reminiscent of Bordeaux, yet the silky mouthfeel is all courtesy of Aussie fruit.

"In a stacked line up of top notch Margaret River Cabernet this wine from Clairault took out the top honors in Decanter's panel tasting. One sip of this beauty and you'll see why. Selected exclusively from the estate's oldest vines from the original plantings in 1976, this is a perfect rendition of why Margaret River has become synonymous with classic Cabernet the world over. Dark brooding fruits, plum and cassis mingle with subtle camphor and cigar box notes, graphite, sandalwood and mint. Medium-full bodied with super fine but present tannins and elongating acidity drive the wine across the palate. Stylistically dissecting powerful, modern Cabernet and classic, refined Bordeaux - this wine has it all. Drink now with an hours decant or keep in the cellar for anytime over the next 15 years. Exceptional vale.

"A pretty, well structured wine that showcases both the perfection of the 2012 vintage and the oldest vines on the Clairault Estate.  The bouquet opens first as warm cherry and raspberry pie and then quickly builds in darker secondary aromas of blackberry and black cherry.  Tertiary notes abound with herbaceous spearmint, fresh bay leaf, vanilla bean and white pepper.  The complexity of the bouquet and continuous evolution were playful and brilliant in the glass.  On the palate the wine is round and full bodied.  Dark chocolate and cassis now enter the picture with vanilla playing a bigger role and the herbs certainly persist. There is a clear harmony from the winemaker’s skill to balance fruit richness and acidity, expose medium ripe tannins and leave you with a persistent finish.  Side note: the wine is under a new modern style screw cap that is heftier than those I’ve seen is the past; a more serious closure for a refined wine.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is yet another example of  the restrained, polished and classy Cabernets being produced in the Margartet River.  There in an effortless flow between the ripe dark fruit profile, savory and spicy notes and the persistent and classy finish.  This execution of balance and precision for under $30.00 is rare.

"There is just so much good Cabernet coming out of Western Australia these days at such good prices that no Cabernet lover can afford to ignore it. The 2012 Clairault Estate Cabernet Sauvignon Margaret River Black Label offers classic appeal with a hint of mint on the nose and ripe, sweet red and black fruits. Superb balance and fine tannins make this eminently drinkable and approachable Cab the perfect choice to accompany dinner tonight.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The older vine age of the grapes used in this wine are really showcased here with the richness and concentration of fruit in this Cab. It's not hard to see why this is a top wine for Clairault and the high scores are well deserved on this one. This is truly a ""wow"" wine with great backbone and length and the softness of deep fruit and slight French oak influence to complement it. The few years of age it has already seen make it delicious now and the price point makes it within the reach of every Cab lover.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"A very elegant and focused Cabernet, with the poise of a St. Julien and the cool ripeness that you would expect from Margaret River.  The nose is all red fruits backed with cedar-y spicey oak.  There is nothing over done with this wine, everything works together seamlessly.  The fruit and spice continue on the palate back by ripe dusty tannins.  This is a wine for every Cabernet lover, new world and old/.

"A very approachable wine that's a pleasure to drink.The Merlot fruit delivers its plums flavors and floral violet aromatics. Soft tannins and a delicious sweet core. Perfect for enjoying on any night.

"Velvety with blackcurrant fruit and notes of licorice, baking spice, tobacco, and aromatic cedar, the 2014 Louis M. Martini is juicy but balanced, with restrained tannic structure and just enough oak at the finish. A shocking price for Sonoma Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a classically lush, ageable choice.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"K&L has long been incredibly high on the Louis M. Martini Sonoma County Cabernet bottling. Year after year it delivers some of the best value not only for Cabernet coming out of Sonoma but out of all the US. Even the veritable Robert Parker himself called it, “One of the best values in Cabernet Sauvignon anywhere in the world,” high praise indeed. From fruit from Martini’s Frei Ranch Vineyards and Barrelli Creek Vineyard this wine takes the ripeness of Dry Creek and meshes it with the refinement and chiseled fruit of Alexander Valley. Pomegranate, Bing cherry, fresh tobacco, tar and a dollop of spearmint and roasting coffee beans fill the high toned and refreshing nose. Having considerable ripeness and extract is certainly a plus at this paltry price point and it has plenty of it with fleshy, easy going texture and a velvety soft feel but this also has a likable mélange of wild berry, eucalyptus, cedar and sweetened dark chocolate to add a note of precision and focus to the overall ripe feel. Then the finish kicks in and takes this to a whole other level with explosive flavors of black cherry, pipe tobacco and chaparral that wines in this price point rarely have. It’s certainly hard to debate Mr. Parker’s sentiments above after trying this.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Impressive quality and serious value from this Sonoma Cab. Blackberry jam, caramel, oaky spice and well-integrated tannins give this wine structure and age-potential. Feel free to serve this wine now for holiday partys or pick-up a few to cellar and see how it evolves over time.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Holy Smokes! Great Sonoma Cabernet for under 15 bucks that I'm actually excited about putting in the cellar?! This is a triumph for the ""high quality yet extremely affordable"" category. It's loaded with dark cassis and blackberry fruit and balanced by the more savory and herbal tones of great Cab: tobacco, cedar and mocha. The spicy oak wraps everything together, and poof -- you have the perfect present for your holiday celebrations. Put an extra case in your cellar and you'll have the gift that keeps on giving for years to come.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"An age-worthy domestic Cab for less than fifteen bucks? Yes, it exists.  This is an incredibly serious wine at a price point that is laughably low.  Black fruit, licorice, blackcurrant, green bell pepper, baking spices.   Toss in a well integrated, powdery tannin on the back end just for good measure.  Dump this bottle into a decanter and don't tell your dinner guests how much you paid for the bottle, they'll be remarkably impressed by your generosity.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is another fantastic bottling from Amici, which has had a string of great Napa Cabs for the previous couple of vintages. Amici represents what people want and love about Napa Cab these days for a far better price than almost anyone else for the quality. Big, rich, lush berry flavors are met by herbal and floral notes to keep the wine from being flabby. There is plenty of structure here, giving this wine the ability to stand up to any good holiday dinner. The tannin is already integrated, balances the wine, and works in harmony with the red fruit. This is a wine where every part of it works together and easily over-delivers.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"A consistently outstanding, well scored Cabernet from Napa Valley that is a staff and customer favorite vintage to vintage. 2014 is the third of a trio of killer vintages from the Valley that brings quality, consistency, and early harvest for acidity and structure. You will see all three in the new vintage of Amici alongside it's sense of black berry, currents and sweet baking spices. Purity and finesse from start to finish.

"This is my pick for entry-level Napa Cab any day of the week--precisely because it doesn't drink like entry-level Napa Cab. The Freemark Abbey performs as well or better than other producer's single vineyard and prestige cuvees. It's dark and smoky with an underlying dark, sweet cherry component that just hits all the right nerves. It's structured for aging, but smooth enough for tonight, with a light touch of oak, and beautiful fruit expression. Anybody who wants a $30 Napa Cab should really consider jumping to the Freemark Abbey, it's a huge step up from anything else on the shelves at its price point.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"A mix of French and American oak adds some interesting notes of spice, vanilla and dill to the ripe black cherry and blackberry fruit flavors in this big and bold wine.  This is rich but very balanced with all that  fruit tempered by hints of toast, savory herb and tobacco on the dark, dry finish.  This is as good as many Napa Cabs that sell for twice as much.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Another massive value—in a land where those are about as common as free tastings! I was blown away at how much this wine has already formed up and eased into its body and power. Dark, black-fruited notes dominate the nose, with pitchy dried meat, wet blacktop and driving concentration. The palate becomes more plush and juicy, with a pleasing core of both red and black currants, sweet oak, tangy olive and laurel notes. Large-scaled and full of umami savor, this is what the 2013 vintage is all about in Napa.

"Domaine de Chevalier is one of my all-time favorite properties in Bordeaux, and that sentiment only intensified after visiting the property this past Spring. Not only were Olivier and his wife humble and charming hosts, their wines were just as enchanting. I like buying wine from people who I respect and admire. It always tastes better that way. To say that the 2014 Chevalier Rouge is subsequently better than any of the other vintages I've tasted would be difficult. I've never had a bad vintage from the property and it's one of the few wines from Bordeaux that I'd say I actually ""collect."" What is abundantly obvious is that the 2014 is significantly cheaper than its 2015 counterpart (at $65) and the 2012 we have in stock now ($55). The wine is easily as good as both those vintages and if you're looking for one of the last real values in Bordeaux, this is it (another reason why I grab bottles when I can afford to). With delicate aromas of red berries along with fine tannins and the classic acidity of Pessac-Leognan, this is a wine that should develop beautifully for decades. It's a wine that allows everyday guys like me to drink the good stuff every now and again; and, believe me, this is the good stuff. If you only buy one Bordeaux from 2014, I would say it's this.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"One of the great values in Bordeaux, Olivier Bernard and his sons Hugo and Adrian are on top of their game. We just did a staff vertical tasting from 1975-2010 and the wines were spectacular.  Another great one here-plenty of minerality and red fruit flavors. Decant and enjoy.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This lovely wine exhibits fresh berry notes on entry, with boysenberry and red raspberry dominating. It achieves an excellent structural balance of tannin and acidity that holds the fruit in check and rounds out the wine nicely. You could certainly drink this now with a good decanting, but it will undoubtedly improve with some time in the cellar.

"The 2nd wine of  Malartic Lagraviere is a flattering wine to drink while you age the Grand Vin.  This is toasty and ripe with an array of red fruits in a delicious and forward style.  There is lots of complexity and pedigree here for not much money.

"The second label of Cru Classé Chateau Malartic-Lagravières, Pessac-Léognan. Enormously appealing, the 2014 La Reserve de Malartic shows to full advantage the near perfect ripening conditions of the long Indian summer of September and October 2014. Made with a slightly higher proportion of Merlot in the blend than the Grand Vin, this is meant to be approachable at a younger age and drinkable over the near term. Ripe and round in style with generous, sweet red fruits and fine tannins. 60% Merlot, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Cabernet Franc. Terrific value here. Drink now or hold.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This second wine of Malartic Lagravière is showing extremely well right now. Very classic Pessac-Léognan with its woodsy, forest floor along with pretty notes of plums, cocoa and a touch of vanilla. Delicious.

"I get a lot of customers who come into the store looking for a bottle of Napa Cab for a dinner they are on their way to. At $30 Napa Cab can be really hit and miss, but this Bordeaux blend is an absolute home run. This wine has tons of intensive fruit, is totally upfront an accessible, and an exceptionally balanced bottle that will wow the table from the moment it is opened. I can't stress enough the quality here, but anyone who loves full-bodied reds from Napa should really consider this a house wine whenever having guests for dinner. If you're looking to wow someone with a bottle, this is a total bullseye.

"All five Bordeaux varietals are blended harmoniously in this dangerously drinkable Chappellet Mountain Cuvée. Chappellet is famous for Bordeaux varietals, with It's high elevation terroir on the Eastern side of  Napa, on Pritchard Hill. Here the grapes achieve maximum ripeness, having access to the morning sunlight coming over the Vaca mountain range. Medium bodied yet fruit forward, this wine delights with luscious flavors and aromas of ripe strawberry, cassis and blueberry, caressed by a soft tannin.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Warm blackberry pie with a thick crust rushes out of the glass to greet you and you smile.  Strawberry high tones accent the nose as you go in for the first sip and are reminded of the beauty that good Merlot can offer.  On the pallet the blackberries start a crescendo of fresh fruit, but the earthy notes of dusty bramble and forest floor bring you back to the sophistication of Bordeaux.  The wine finishes clean with good structure and build a mean thirst for a second glass.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Easily my favorite sub-$15 Bordeaux in store. Farmed and vinified both organic and biodynamic. Dark berries, blackberry, currant, and dried herbs on the nose. On the palate, the wine is generous with the dark fruit once more, savory notes, and black pepper. Elevated acidity and mineral flavors really give this medium-bodied wine nice lift. A top value, both as a choice for parties or as a weekday red with dinner
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"We have a lot of great deals in Bordeaux, and this is no exception.  This is a lovely wine for drinking now or in a few years.  The 2015 vintage in Bordeaux is considered a potential classic by winemakers and critics alike.  With generous dark fruit, great minerality and well-balanced structure, this is a great weeknight wine to open when you want to feel like you're splurging.

"We made a lot of friends with this wine last year, it was great to see it again. Organic everyday Bordeaux, what is not to like.  Medium-bodied, dry tannins, modest mid-palate richness, with dark red fruits that are dusted with tobacco and earth.

"Here is a Cab you need to hail, now more than ever: where else are you going to find a delicious, balanced, certified organic/biodynamic Bordeaux red for the holidays for under eleven bucks? The nose is classic cassis accented with cracked pepper. The wine shows natural, not confected fruit, with hints of licorice-star anise and black pepper, a medium body, and light, dusty tannins. If you like your wines on the drier side, put this up against any similarly priced Bordeaux blend from anywhere else around the globe, and this'll hold its own quite nicely; that is, where it doesn't immediately trounce the competition.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"There is wonderful sweetness to the raspberry and baked cherry fruit flavors on this  low-priced, delicious and organic wine.  This is lively, clean, bone dry and has great mineral lift throughout the mid-palate.  The subtle pulverized tannins on the fine finish add length and a food-friendly snap.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"A very nice, easy Bordeaux to dress up a dinner, to take to a casual dinner with friends, or to just enjoy on its own. Its fruity nose is very enticing, with raspberry, plums and even a touch of vanilla. The palate is very friendly, with soft tannins. A crowd pleaser.

"Don't shy away from this excellent Cabernet due to the newer AVA! This wine came to our attention a couple of vintages ago, and has consistently been one of our top recommendations every since. Each year the quality of the fruit and the unique soil profile together with the insightful wine-making, result in a Cabernet almost too good to be true at this price. Looking for excellent quality California Cabernet that won't break the bank? Give this wine a try, and I'm betting you'll quickly be back for more.

"2017 marks the 20th anniversary of the purchase of Chateau Malartic-Lagravière by the Bonnie family. In the past two decades they have spared no expense in the restoration of this historic property, from the replanting of vineyards to the construction of an innovative gravity-fed winery. The estate was one of only six awarded cru classé status for both red and white wine in the Graves classification of 1959. The quality of both has continued to improve in remarkable fashion even in the past few years, making Chateau Malartic-Lagravière one of the better values in Pessac-Léognan, and a property to watch in the future. The 2009 vintage in particular was a great success here. All the hard work since 1997 was amply rewarded in a vintage with near perfect growing conditions, yielding a wine of great refinement and character. Hints of violets and black fruits on the nose with slightly smoky, toasted notes (80% new oak). On the palate, rich dark fruit. Lovely weight with positively silky tannins. Wonderfully ripe but very lively and fresh with a nice touch of minerality. Overall a very balanced effort. Highly recommended. 59% Cabernet Sauvignon, 38% Merlot, 3% Petit Verdot.

"MAN....is this wine in a great place right now!! Everything is congealed, moving in and out of focus, as the symphony of fruit, forest, spice and earth sings across the palate; each element getting a brief solo, but ultimately contributing to the immense texture and harmony. This is a great bottle of wine, period, but it's more than that for those who are looking to understand the merit of aging your claret. Five years ago this wine didn't have anywhere near this level of complexity, but today its showing like you wouldn't believe. I'm glad I waited to pop my bottles, but luckily for those of you who didn't buy on pre-order back in the day, we've got another shipment of perfectly aged 2009 Malartic-Lagraviere for you to buy and open today.

From the Haut-Medoc near Margaux, with some of the elegance of the more famous appellation. Lightly floral with ripe, sweet fruit, lively acidity and fine tannins. A terrific value at this price point. Drinking well now but will continue to improve with another three to five years in the cellar.

"This was a runaway hit at our last Bordeaux staff tasting. Dark fruit with a hint of mint  on the nose leads to a palate that is just so elegant and balanced.

"On the outskirts of St. Helena, rising behind the town on the west side of the Napa Valley, is Spring Mountain — one of the most coveted sources of Cabernet fruit in the state and a site that has produced a number of my favorite California wines over the years. Upon that hillside sits the Spring Mountain Vineyard Winery with a 226 acre vineyard on the eastern slopes that's broken up into 135 blocks, each with its own unique terroir. As you can imagine, this gives the winery a vast set of tools with which to construct their annual Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon release. I'm always preaching the gospel of ""mountain fruit"" to our customers, whether it's Spring, Howell, or Diamond, because of its concentration and complexity compared to what's grown on the valley floor. Mountain wines also tend to have more power and drive with the potential to age decades in the cellar. When fruit is grown on a hillside, it tends to ripen more slowly due to less direct sunlight (think of simmering your stew versus boiling it), plus the drainage is better during rainy months as the water will flow downhill rather than bog down the vineyard soils. The best Cabernet wines from California come from the mountains, no matter which mountains you're referring to. Spring Mountain, however, happens to be one of the best locales and the appellation has become world-renowned for wines with pureness of fruit and elegant, balanced tannins. What's fascinating about the 2012 release from Spring Mountain, however, is how soft and silky it is on the palate and how precocious the flavors are at such a young age. Its rich and plush at first sip, but it unwinds slowly into classic Cabernet flavors of earth and spice with hints of brush on the finish. All around this is a grade A Napa mountain fruit specimen, but the value really comes with the new discounted price. You could grab a case of this and drink well on birthdays and anniversaries for the next decade.

"Spring Mountain's estate Cabernet Sauvignon is fantastic, with a great price to match. This wine already has 5 years of age and drinking wonderfully now, but also has a long life ahead of it. Its full, rich body is accompanied by red currant, raspberry,  and cassis with big tannin that's well integrated. It also has some wonderful spice and earthy character giving more complexity. This is a great deal, especially for a wine from Napa's Spring Mountain region.

"After thirty years in the retail business, I think one of the aspects that still keeps me motivated is finding excellent quality wine, as with the 2014 Trébiac, in this price range. I have always found it easy, if not boring, to sell the expensive 'stuff' that has received a b'zillion points from the many different wine writers, but finding wine as this and selling it in quantity to our customers continues to excite me. This Gem is medium-deep ruby in color, offers a lovely nose of black cherry to cedary to earthy tones whcih carries over nicely to a soft, round, drinkable Bordeaux with a silky finish. Rusty has demanded that I bring home several cases of this Gem for our near-term consumption. GREAT VALUE!!!

"This is a classic 2014 wine with its high-toned fruit. It might surprise some for its blend of 70% Merlot and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, and it is delicious. A nose with fruit notes of cherry, plums and a touch of cola, along with an earthiness that is so typical of the best Graves wines. The palate shows its fruit in all its juiciness, but it doesn’t end there: spices and even a surprising note of salty minerality make sure this wine will be perfectly at ease at the table. I would age it for a couple more years, or a put it through a quick passage in the decanter if you are impatient.

There are plenty of firm tannins on the back end, meaning the wine should have great potential for the cellar, but it tastes so darn good right now I think most people would have a tough time keeping their hands off of it. The Malescot sums up the 2015 Margaux vintage perfectly: it's a wine of beauty, finesse, and elegance. For the price, it may be the best value we see from the appellation. I'm expecting this and Issan to be the vintage's top bargains for those who (like me) cannot afford to buy wines like Chateau Margaux proper.

"I've been drinking the Jax wines for years now and I think I can safely say that the 2015 Napa Cabernet is the best wine I've ever tasted from the local producer. Their winemaker Kirk Venge continues to fine-tune this expression with every vintage and each time he seems to get better at doing it. The 2015 is his masterwork thus far. I've tasted it on five separate occasions now and the wine is simply perfect from front to back. It's also the perfect mid-range bottle for those of you who enjoy your Napa Cab on the younger and richer side, but I can foresee plenty of cellar life on the horizon. The dark red fruits pop with juiciness, but are buoyed by velvet tannins and plenty of acidity. It's never cloying or bloated with sweetness, but rather expansive and mouthcoating with just a bit of chewiness on the finish. The Jax Cabernet has always been my go-to fifty dollar Napa red. We've been tremendously successful with the brand for some time. But the 2015 goes beyond simple dependability. This is a masterpiece of modern Napa winemaking. Bravo.

The second it's poured, this wine is complex and aromatic with dark, rich and complex flavors. Fresh blackberries, cassis, cedar and black cherry character really shine through. The longer it's in the glass, it continues to evolve with delicate flavors and robust coffee notes. There is balanced acidity and fine tannin, ensuring aging potential but also drinks great right now!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Deliciously seductive 2015 Jax Cabernet Sauvignon is incredibly drinkable and fully approachable despite its young age. It's full-bodied and rich with velvety, supple tannins and bright acidity which gives this wine good aging potential. But what I love about this Cab the most is amazing flavors: black mulberry, marionberry and black cassis all wrapped up in espresso and dark spice notes.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Grown on well-drained gravel and clay soils, this attractively crimson-hued Bordeaux  is a mouthwatering blend of 45% Merlot, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon, and 20% Cabernet Franc, delivering delightful aromas and supple, round flavors of  cherry, blackcurrant, vanilla and toast, with smoothly-defined tannins. Pair with a grass-fed burger and swiss cheese, this is an excellent  everyday Bordeaux value from a fine vintage.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This has earthy cherry fruit with a dark edge underneath the elegant exterior.  This solid wine is a consistent over achiever and drinks well above the modest price.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"I always love this elegant wine made by the Beychevelle team. Pretty red fruit aromas--quite soft on the palate.  The folks at the Wine Enthusiast love it also at 92 points.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Seamless wine! Starts with lovely aromas of red fruit and spice, earthy notes and black currants with touch of red plum. On the palate it has great structure with very smooth developed tannins, bright fruit and charming earthiness. Charming and perfect for drinking it now.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This has pretty red fruit on the nose: black cherry, strawberry and minerals.  The extra merlot gives this a riper edge than some other clarets from the vintage, but there is still great acidity.  It is just starting to show savory elements like leather and forest floor.  I had this with Christmas dinner, and it was showing great!

"Purchased in 2013 by the Cuvelier family, owners of neighboring Clos Fourtet, along with Clos St-Martin and Les Grandes Murailles. This continues a centuries-old tradition of family ownership that dates back to the founding of the property in 1643. Toasty oak and a hint of violets on the nose. Merlot dominates the blend in this Right Bank value, with ripe, almost jammy plum notes. Finishes with fine tannins.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"An unknown property that makes good value wines based on their Merlot vineyards.  Black fruits on the nose.  Ripe and fruity on the palate with brisk acidity.  Enjoy with rack of lamb.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"An altogether lovely wine! The blend is slightly more Merlot dominate in this vintage, which adds to the silky texture and the lovely black-fruit perfume. Although this wine is still on the young side for drinking, it has all the components in place, and will undoubtedly prove the quality of this Chateau with a little extra time in the cellar.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"You need to dig deep into this deep and creamy wine to find the St-Estephe firmness buried underneath the plush blackberry and rich cherry fruit.  Although opulent enough to enjoy tonight the serious structure holding this together will reward the patient collector.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"A classic Left-Bank Bordeaux nose of dark fruits, notably of plum and black currants, along with leather, violets, and gravel. Dark fruit dominates the palate profile as well, with blackcurrant, blackberry, and dark cherry flavors exuding themselves.  Stony, gravelly minerality and slight hints of dried thyme on the finish. Broad tannins and an elevated acidity make this wine a very nice choice as a holiday food wine; think roast leg of lamb, prime rib, or Beef Wellington. It is preferable to decant this wine for at least 30 minutes - 1 hour prior to serving for maximum enjoyment
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is a wine that drinks well above it's price point. Rich fruit, soft tannin, fresh acid and a long finish. Blackberries, and dark cherries give way to cocoa, coffee and a touch of leather. The depth of the wine is amazing and lingers of the palate.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is full, rich and almost extravagant but held in check by the integration of powerful structure, wonderful proportion and a finish of fine, ripe tannin.  From an appellation that was a roaring success in 2016 this is a relative bargain.

"Noon at Ch. Malescot  One wine to taste with Jean Luc Zugar. 55%CS 37M 6CF 2PV “The 2015 was a 3 Star beauty and the 2016 is again a fabulous 3 Star wine. Perfectly extracted ripe grapes and great tasting, fine blance, tannins and long finishing. 3 Stars and also by FAR the greatest value for great Margaux wine.”
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Another standout with fantastic berry fruit, baker’s chocolate and super-silky tannins with that unmistakable Margaux feel.  This was the biggest seller we had for the 2015 Bordeaux offering.  This wine is vying with it for the crown of best in store. Bright and lively.So lush and ripe.  Jean Luc Zuger has fashioned another top wine for 2016.  This wine is a bit more precise than the 2015.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"There is nothing better than a wine that houses two seemingly opposite characteristics under the same cork. In the case of Malescot, it’s all about poise and power (the hallmark of GREAT Bordeaux). Malescot has fast become one of my favorite properties in Margaux, with the 2016 offering even furthering the case. Whether a Bordeaux neophyte or devotee, you are going to love this wine! Wonderful layers of ripe blue and red fruits are offset by savory complexity and long refreshing mineral tones. You will be hard pressed to find a more palate-pleasing wine at this price anywhere in the world.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Delicious.  Delivers everything that I want from a wine from this region.  Crunchy dark red fruit, stony gravelly tones, a hint of oak and fine polished tannins.  This wine way over preforms for the price point.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"2014 seems like a vintage tailor-made for the Graves region. A long, cool summer kept acid levels high, lending the wines a noticeable freshness and liveliness. A nearly perfect autumn with warm days and cool nights brought the grapes to perfect ripeness, yielding an admirable sweetness of fruit. Add to that the classic Graves mineral profile and you have a veritable trifecta of taste. Owned by the Perrin family, who also own Cru Classé Chateau Carbonnieux, Chateau Haut Vigneau is always a terrific value. This 2014 vintage is partly floral, partly savory on the nose with notes of tobacco and smoke. Very lively and fresh in the mouth with classic Graves minerality and fine tannins. Soft and round with loads of sweet fruit, this medium to full-bodied effort is ready to drink tonight. Decant for best results.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"An overachieving property of Carbonnieux fame that scores big in the price/quality ratio year after year.  This gravely wine has hints of spice, mineral and milk chocolate to go along with the crunchy dark currant fruit and sweet, rocky finish.  Fairly deep and rich for the appellation but satisfying and super food-friendly.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is a killer Bordeaux value and it's an eye-opener into how good the 2014 vintage really is. In the modern age of sound bites and short summaries, we tend to classify entire vintages into ""good"" or ""bad."" 2009 = good, for example. Anything not hyped as the greatest vintage of all time gets short shrift as a result. When broad strokes like that get painted in the wine world, two things happen: prices stay low and values get overlooked. That's exactly what happened here with the 2014 Haut Vigneau, a wine I've now enjoyed on a number of occasions. The quality is apparent in the first sip, before you've even decanted it. The fruit is pretty and restrained. The tannins are subtle and understated. The minerality of the Graves moves like an undercurrent beneath the berries and the earth. I've had this wine with steak, with chicken, even with Chinese food. It always tastes great. Then I look at the $17.99 price tag and it starts tasting even better.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Château Haut-Vigneau is owned by Eric Perrin, the son of the late Anthony Perrin of Chateau Carbonnieux fame. This property is one of the best value reds in all of Bordeaux. The 2014 is absolutely delicious--soft and elegant with tons of ripe red fruit flavors on the mid-palate. This vintage also has a core of mineral on the palate. I prefer this to their 2012.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"I am a California Cab guy. I find this wine to be utterly mind blowing. I can't buy more because I don't have a wine fridge. The wine: dark purple, explosion of plum, creme de cassis milling around, and a very minute tangy/grapey flavor, almost a touch Amarone-esque. Amazing stuff.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Succulent and bearing nicely integrated oak, this has lots of roasted plums, a hint of herbs, floral notes and plenty of red berry fruits. You can count on Australia to over-deliver without overwhelming.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is such a great value and a real chance for newcomers to Australia to jump into one of the country's most interesting Cabernet regions: Connewara along the Limestone Coast of South Australia. The red soil along with the maritime climate creates expressive and characterful Cabernets that have much more than just ripe fruit and an ample mouthfeel. The Penley ""Phoenix"" is exhibit A, brimming with herbaceous flavors, hints of tobacco, but also a savory black olive note and a dark, decadent finish. There's A LOT of wine here for the money, but also a great learning opportunity. I've found my exploration into the wines of Australia to be incredibly rewarding, especially since visiting earlier this year. It's wines like this that keep me coming back for more.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"A stellar bargain in Cabernet. This is has the richness, power and structure that has made this grape King! Packed full with blackcurrant, cassis, plum, sweet oak, a touch of cigar box and fresh picked mint. Mouth-filling and voluptuous but with fine sculpting tannins; beautiful length and freshness on the palate. A super complete wine the like of which normally comes with a $50+ price tag. Try it for yourself...see what we are raving about.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Along with the Penley Shiraz we carry, I was blown away when I saw the price on this wine. This is an absolutely delicious Cab from an old school producer and one I would be happy to present at any event, especially at this price point. It's deep and the Cab Sauv woodsy qualities shine though without overwhelming the fruit.  I found it layered and interesting and was super excited to see this as the entry level wine for such a well respected producer. If this is how good their least expensive wines are, I can't wait to see the higher tier bottlings.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"It's back and better than ever! Silky smooooooth on the palate and packed with the seductive dark fruit tones of blackberry, blueberry and baked plums. Hints of tobacco and cedar brings it all together to display the beautiful structure of this vintage. It's full-bodied and rich but not cloying or sappy. It definitely over delivers for the price. This is soul-warming Cab and it's delicious!

"Pontet Canet- The lively bright purple fruit is so very pure and tasty! Lots of blueberry and black currant fruit with great freshness and delicious taste. Nice elegance, no hard tannins, perfect extraction. Claret style; which means crisp and fresh! 2 Stars
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is a dark and decadent wine with lush black fruits and oak influence that turn into earthier elements and tannic structure on the finish. It's also a powerful wine with a massive finish compared to its 2015 counterparts. There's a flurry of pepper and herbs on the finish that come out to play once the fruit fades away. Could be the wine of the vintage for those in search of big, structured, cellar-worthy wines.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"A perfect score for quality vs price for this beauty. Unfortunately production was done almost 50%, so our allocation is not great. 65% Cabernet and 30% Merlot with the rest CF and PV. Deep, dark blue-black color. Very spicy aromas and flavors. Great depth of flavor here-not a monster (only 13.5 alcohol)but on elegant side. Perfect balance and long, lingering finish. Compare this to the 2009 at $299 or the 2010 at $279.  Should go to $200 by release time.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"**Don’t Miss** Inky color.  Deep, pure, and large scaled with black and blue fruits, exotic spice, and a firm but unctuous mid-palate with smoky oak. Moderate plus body with a long and intense finish. One for the cellar and will reward the patient.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"I may be partial to wines from St-Julien, but this particular bottle certainly outshines its price point by a long shot. It's drinking beautifully at present, but still shows plenty of structure to continue aging. On the palate, the wine shows plenty of bright, red fruit, elegant cigar box spice, and just the right amount of savory development. If you are in the market for a nicely aged Bordeaux that drinks beautifully,  I wouldn't hesitate to try this wine.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Finding perfectly stored older Bordeaux at a decent price from a good producer is extremely tough and one of the reasons we deal with so many different negociants in Bordeaux. The 1999 vintage was not one of power and concentration like 2000, it was far softer and easier to drink with nice soft-ripe fruit. My notes reflect exactly that as I told Clyde on the way home on the plane from the 1999 evaluation...""I don't think I have ever written down, tastes good so many times for young wines"". The second wine of Gruaud Larose from 1999 is drinking beautifully now showing soft, warm, developed herbal fruit flavors with hints of earth and leather. The 2000 is a few years away from the perfect drinking window and is a much tighter, stronger and fresher expression with some nice red current fruit underneath the wood. Both wines are a steal for mature Bordeaux.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Darker in color and more closed aromatically than the 1999, this shows the power and structure of the vintage with sweeter fruit and a deeper core of richness.  This is full-bodied, chewy and classically styled with ripe tannins embedded in the crunchy currant and dark plum fruit.  Decant this for an hour and enjoy with hearty food.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Great structure and balance! A wine with great length and complexity with firm tannins and good acidity the 2000 Sarget de Gruaud Larose. This wine has dark berry fruit, underbrush and bitter chocolate notes unfold on the palate as this youthful 2nd wine begins to spread its wings.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The second label of second growth Chateau Gruaud-Larose, named for one of the property's most prominent 19th century owners. The 2000 Sarget de Gruaud Larose, St-Julien shows off the strength of this millennial vintage. Big and round in the mouth with admirable weight. Lightly floral nose with characteristic tobacco notes. Lively fresh-picked blackberry fruit. Finishes firm with tannins still noticeably present. Drink or hold.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"I just tasted this wine (July 7, 2016). A smoky, toasty, rich and concentrated nose of red fruits. Like the 1999 but richer on nose and on the palate. This has some tannins but with decanting you can enjoy now with a rich meal.  I would save this wine for a few years and enjoy the 1999 now.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Do not attempt to drink this wine without first decanting for an hour!  But if you do decant you will get soaring aromas of raspberries, blackberries and earthy potting soil in a muscular but caressing mid-palate with a huge mineral core.  There is a deep and enveloping warmth to the ripe fruit and a full-bodied but gentle mouth feel to the substantial middle.  Decant a bottle tonight and lay another away for 10 or more years.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"I love, love love (did I mention that I love) St. Julien, and Lagrange is one of those properties that consistently flies under the radar. It is therefore priced accordingly, and a relative bargain for the excellent 2009 vintage.  My first experience with a bottle of Lagrange was at a French bistro in SF, enjoying a bottle of the 1999 alongside steak frites, maybe sometime in 2008 or 2009. It was sumptuous, elegant, the perfect combination of restrained Bordeaux fruit, acidity, and delicate savor. While I love my 1999s, you can rest assured that the 2009s are much better! This is tasty now after an hour decant (which is incidentally when I ran into my colleague and noticed he was tasting it), though it is undoubtedly a 20+ year wine if you prefer to wait patiently as this fine St. Julien matures.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Awesome little Bordeaux blend from Te Mata. This is made from 100% estate fruit. (In fact Te Mata sell a good quantity of their fruit...so this actually comes from some of the best parcels on the estate they keep for themselves.) Despite being the ""entry level"" tier of wines this really shows it's pedigree. Dark fruit, earth, cigar box, a hint of charred oak; the nice tannin structure and balanced acidity means this will also keep for 5+ years no problem. Such a great value given the quality of the wine and iconic stature of the producer.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"A very alluring California Cabernet with lovely restraint and finesse. Its dark fruits, the warmth of baking spices, pleasantly grippy tannins and solid structure will sway anyone who shuns all California Cabs.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The deep cassis core in this wine is super attractive, hard to find this note in this price range. Great spice on the nose. The tannin structure is energetic, letting you know the wine can be enjoyed now or set down for some time and develop into something even better. Flank steak 101.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"It is always a pleasure to taste Napa Cabernet that is made in what I would call a “classic” style. The 2013 Groth is a wine like that. Instead of that vanilla bean and over-ripe fruit character, I get tons of red cherries, cassis, coffee and five spice. It is a firm, full bodied wine that shows a ""terroir"" driven backbone which I would consider refreshing these days.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Old school in style with incredible drinkability, Groth Cabernet Sauvignon is an icon of Napa Valley, showing currant and cherry fruit, with subtle smokiness and substantial structure, and finishing with silky tannins. With its depth, elegance, and purity of fruit, the 2013 is an easy go-to for California fans and Bordeaux drinkers alike.

"On these cool winter nights there is nothing better than a big Napa Cabernet!  Silverado reveals itself with plush notes of black fruit, dried herbs and espresso tasting notes.  This is not about overblown fruit.  It is big, but balanced with the fruit, oak and tannins,  all well integrated.  Silky smooth and velvety in texture, the classic Staggs Leap District Cab pervades.  The balanced acidity makes for a long finish, with flavors that continue to warm the insides of the heart.  Light a fire, open the bottle of Silverado and enjoy the magic that only a Napa Cabernet can bring.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"What a gem! Surprisingly green on the nose, with pepper notes and subtle mocha through the palate, Silverado is a well-balanced Cabernet Sauvignon that somehow showcases classic Napa style while feeling reminiscent of Bordeaux. In fact, we sneaked it into a lineup of Left Bank new arrivals and it held its own! This is still California though: dark berry fruit shines through, with a welcome structure to the finish. Grip, elegance, and all estate fruit for barely 40 bucks – the 2013 Silverado will impress Napa fans and beyond.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Silverado is an old school, traditional producer and that is exactly what you get from this Cab. Classics aromatics on the nose with subtle green and spice notes, coupled with black raspberry black cherry and plum. The palate is silky and supple with some nice grippy but needed tannins. Top this under $40 Cab with a persistent finish of integrated oak and balanced fruit and you have a time honored Napa Cab style for an amazing value!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"A classic Napa Cabernet in a style and price point that has become all too rare these days! It's built on deep, earthy, powerful fruit, loamy notes, cedar and cigar box. The palate is rich and full but not confected or over extracted. The oak gives a framework and exotic spice but doesn't over power the varietal nuances. There's a freshness to the fruit and a line and length that is really well done. Real pedigree on display here. In the realms of modern Napa Cab this is a very impressive and complete wine for such a modest price point.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Glad to see another well made and super interesting Napa Cab come in at under $40! Toasted mocha, burnt caramel, and chewy tannins give this wine tons of complex, interesting, and satisfying flavor and mouth feel. The acidity is balanced, making this a perfect dinner pairing for a protein, especially one covered in a sweeter sauce, whether it be BBQ or fruit-based.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The 2013’s sure do impress! One of the later releases, the Silverado Estate Cabernet, is a great example of a California Cabernet that is not overdone. The fruit is full and ripe but is balanced with the rest of the wine. This is a big, sturdy Cab that shows lots of complexity but still manages to show some finesse. This should please most if not all California Cab drinkers.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Now this is Napa Valley Cab! Instantly on the nose, whether blind tasting or not, you can tell that it's a Napa Valley Cabernet. While there is a subtle underlying herbaceous note, most likely due the splash of Cab Franc, classic aromatics of black cherry, currant, blackberry, sweet dried oak and mocha dominate the nose and palate.  Matching the intense aromatics is a weighty yet silky mouthfeel that rounds out this classic yet inexpensive NV Cab.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Elegant ruby/purple color with a nose full of raspberries, currant, and forest floor. The use of oak is so well integrated; you can smell a hint of vanilla, but it is very light. The fruit notes reflect on the palate, but are supported with a touch of tobacco and vibrant acidity. This is a bottle that will develop nicely.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This small production, gorgeous Rutherford Cabernet is made from some of the appellation's finest fruit, and can stand up to wines three times the price. With classic dusty, fine tannins and aromas of dried rose petal, strawberry and star anise, this wine is elegant and powerful. It's focused, medium bodied palate with layered complexity make a great pairing with anything from fall stews to braised beef.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Fragrant on the nose, lots going on here including peppered cassis, strawberry chews, and a bit of dark licorice.

Along with a great tannic bite, this makes a great option for newer California drinkers looking to step their game up a notch.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is a wine that you can sink your teeth into! Full bodied and chewy with ample tannins, this is a must have Cab for those who love a wine they can take a bite out of.

"The concept behind the Two Lands label at Jacob's Creek is to bring together two world class winemakers from California and Australia to create the best of both worlds. Ehren Jordan, the winemaker/proprietor from famed Napa winery Failla, melds his expertise with that of Aussie winemaker Bernard Hickin to create a lush, yet subtly oaked every day Cabernet, with aromas of blueberry, blackberry, and herbaceous undertones.

"This is what a perfect Napa Valley Bordeaux Blend is supposed to taste like and Pahlmeyer has become my benchmark against which I measure all others. There is incredible depth and complexity in this wine, while being simultaneously velvety and soft. Most importantly, this wine is just incredibly delicious, balancing strength and elegance and present, but not jammy fruit. A phenomenal wine that I would feel privileged to drink again and I think people will find this vintage turned out much better than some expected.

"Effortless beauty and finesse. If you're looking for an aromatically expressive Bordeaux blend that doesn't quit, that has a lovely, spicy, brightly acidic, velvety mouth-feel on the palate, then this should be at the top of your list. Loads of dry flowers, bright fruit, and graphite on the nose. Delicious fruit, light minerals, lifted acidity, and fresh herbs play well together on the palate. This is one of my favorite players in the short list of wines that have achieved  cult-like status. While many others in this category are much less approachable, the Pahlmeyer Bordeaux Blend offers up lots more freshness and appeal a lot sooner. An iconic wine indeed!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The 2014 Pahlmeyer Bordeaux blend really hits the mark when it comes to luxury, elegance and balance, just what we'd expect from a high-end Napa producer. Fabulous aromatics fill the glass of black cherries, cocoa powder, licorice and cedar box.

"Rich and luscious are the first words that come to mind when trying this 2014 Pahlmeyer Bordeaux Blend. Consisting of 87% Cabernet Sauvignon, followed by Merlot, Malbec, Cabernet Franc, and Petit Verdot in decreasing percentages, each harvested and vinified separately in more than 50 individual lots. This wine also sees 85% new French oak; a selection of Seguin Moreau Icone and Taransaud barrels. Initial aromas of ripe blackberry and dark cherry are followed by a bouquet of cigar, clove, and graphite. On the palate, intense black currant, dried dark fruit, and dark chocolate permeate through the finish along with silky tannins. This wine possesses both power and elegance
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The 2014 Pahlmeyer Bordeaux is a beautifully balanced and elegant blend of all five varieties, with delicious aromas of candied raspberry and strawberry, balanced by a waft of dense spice, with anise taking the forefront. One of the wonderful characteristics of the 2014 vintage in Napa is the dark, herbaceous quality that seems to be ever-present, and it shines through in the Pahlmeyer, tempering the fruit and creating a fascinating counterpoint. With well-integrated, supple tannin and a thread of bright acid, this wine will definitely age well, but can be easily enjoyed today.

",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"A surprisingly serious Cab from South Australia, this has been consistently good in the past few vintages that I have tasted. Medium-bodied with ripe berry notes, this wine does not get overly ripe or jammy. Instead a lovely acid core drives it forward and fine tannin runs along and coats the palate. Notes of mint and eucalyptus mingle with the layers of currant and blackberry making this a wonderful food wine that will go beautifully with lamb or beef.

"Classic Coonawarra Cab for a song. Jim Barry is one of the best known wineries in South Australia's Clare Valley. Founded in the 1950's Jim Barry has produced some of Australia's most heralded wines, namely the ""Armagh"" with more than ten 95-99+ point Advocate scores in it's history. Whilst being recognized as one of the countries top producers, what I love about Jim Barry is the incredible value they can deliver with wines like Cover Drive! As an Englishman myself  the name based around a shot one might use during a game of Cricket always makes me chuckle. The vines are planted where the village Cricket field once stood. Deep in this wine's rich red fruit and and exotic spices I think I can still pick up some leather and willow! Bad jokes aside, this is delicious Cabernet with real varietal character and freshness. A classic Coonawarra profile for probably less than half the price I would expect to pay for a wine of this quality. This is a bargain.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Yeeesssssss.......pure-fruited, elegant, low alcohol (13.5%) cabernet from Coonawarra for fifteen bucks! As a passionate Bordeaux drinker, I have to say I've become a bit smitten with the cabs of Australia over the last year, mainly because they offer many of the subtle nuances and earthy undertones that I enjoy from the Medoc wines. The Barry ""Cover Drive"" is a great example of that crossover potential. There's fruit, but it's layered with spice and notes of brush, so it's never overtly ripe or too supple. The finish is lean and mean--none of that new oak nonsense and clean with elegant tannins. It's a whole 'lotta wine for the money. Grab a few for the mid-week and save your Pichon-Baron for a fancier weekend dinner.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Coonawarra is producing some delicious, very easy-drinking wines and this Cover Drive is no exception. It is soft and approachable with lush fruit and just a touch of acidity on the front palate to brighten it up. This Cab Sauv does not overwhelm with overpowering tannin or spice, but glides across the palate with its silky mouthfeel. The Barry family has been making wine here for generations and it's easy to see why their legacy has lasted when you taste this Cab.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This represents so much of what I love about the wines we are bringing in from NZ, beautiful new world fruit done with old world elegance. Elephant Hill is one of my favorite wineries in this area (and is a spectacular place to visit from what I hear) and this red blend is one of the reasons for that. Dark, rich berry notes are balanced by plenty of acid that never feels out of balance. Notes of licorice and eucalyptus play against the red and black berry and are surrounded by silky tannins, and at only 13.5 abv and under $20 this is a perfect wine to stock up on. You can drink this beauty now or hold on to it, or just get enough to do both.

"This is a killer BBQ wine and should not only be at all of your Summer parties all season long, but can take you into Fall and Winter as well thanks to the deep, slightly spicy fruits. Even though Hawke's Bay is one pf the warmer appellations of New Zealand, it is still quite cool, thanks to its very southerly position on the globe. This ensures that all of its wines retain a good amount of acidity, which means you can produce a killer red blend like this at only 13.5% alcohol. The red shows great structure, but is not heavy or flabby thanks to that preserved acidity. The different characters from the 3 vineyards play epically into this and give great depth and character. This is definitely something I will be drinking over the months to come.

"This lovely little quaffer is one of the best cross overs in NZ right now. It has lots of life and some good structure, but isn't ultra minty or eucalyptus. Great ripeness paired with elegant structure. Dark current, some plummy notes, and an easy earthy spice on the finish. This is one that almost any red wine lover can easily get behind. Love Bordeaux, you'll probably like this. Cali Cab? No doubt this is in your range. A very easy wine to love.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is one of my favorite $20 reds in the store! I would be happy to find a Bordeaux style blend of this caliber for under $30, but at this price I'm thrilled. Stylistically, this wine sits at a juncture between a polished, modern fruit-forward expression, and an iconic, structured, traditional take. The wine can appeal to both California Cab lovers, and Bordeaux enthusiasts. However, there's a twist! Elephant Hill also incorporates a small amount of Syrah, which adds just the right amount of black pepper spice to make this an all-around stellar selection for almost any occasion.

"I took a whiff of this and the aromatics screamed Bordeaux! But with a Napa Valley sensibility, of course. You can smell how expensive the oak is they use in this, and trust me, they spare no expense in accessories at Opus One. I love the Overture because it's so much more open and gives immediate gratification, while their first label takes a few years in cellar to open up. This isn't usually released and is very rarely in stock. So take advantage.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This release of Overture is a blend of 2010, 2011 and 2012. These 3 very different vintages combined to make a very interesting wine. A bit of power is coming from the 2010, acidity, finesse and complexity is coming from the 2011 and a big wallop of fruit is coming from the 2012. The Overture is made in the exactly same facilities, uses the same fruit sources and is made by the same wine-making team as Opus One.  It just sells for less than half the price! Opus makes this wine to drink upon release and this wine is drinking excellent right now.

"Chateau Siran always offers great value, but the 2015 has surpassed even their impressive normal quality level.  The best Siran I've tasted so far, this Merlot heavy cepage offers a fantastic amount of richness and structure with  plushness and avelvety overlay.  Deep blue and dark berry fruit, with a nice under layer of more complex cocoa and soft leather.  It will lure you into drinking now, but be sure to put some into the cellar for a few years, I'm sure it will reward you.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"2015 will not only be remembered as the vintage that brought sanity back to Bordeaux pricing, it will be remembered by enthusiasts as the year Margaux dominated the communes. Just about every wine we tasted from the region was balanced, beautiful, and elegant. When the combination of great pricing and great quality comes together, it only adds to our initial excitement. Just like the Malescot before (a Margaux wine we sold TONS of), the Siran showcases everything we loved about the vintage but at an even lower price. The difference here is the Merlot dominance, but the grace is still there under all that dark fruit. The wine is alive and kicking, plush on the palate, and loaded with drive and panache. It's also less than thirty bucks. I'd say: go for it.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The 2015s from Margaux are stunning and perhaps the best region for the vintage. Another great value wine here-a bit old school like me, the Siran has 55% merlot and the black fruit flavors are intense. So sweet on the palate-you want to drink it now, but it has great balance for the cellar.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The commune of Margaux was without the a doubt the “Star Commune” in 2015 because damn near every wine we tasted was very good. But if you ask me for the greatest overall wine for the money it is Ch. Siran. We visited owner Edouard Mialhe here a few years ago and have been watching his wine continue to improve; I think his 2015 will be the wine that brings Ch. Siran back to the forefront of the marketplace. The wine has beautiful sweetness in its ripe fruit, good richness and weight, fine mid palate texture and a lovely finish! By far the best wine from Ch. Siran I’ve ever had. This is a marvelous bottle of Margaux at a great price!

"An all-time favorite of K&L.  Almost every vintage is good here-especially since 2000.  This is their best to date, but do not believe me-just ask our friend James Suckling.  I think he is a 94 on it.Tastes great now and will so for many years to come.

"If I were to summarize my tastes as a booze professional, I'd say I like ""classic"" flavors. I like Bourbon that tastes like Bourbon, Scotch that tastes like Scotch, Chablis that tastes like Chablis, and most importantly Bordeaux that tastes like Bordeaux. While 2009, 10, 15, and 16 get all the hype due to their fleshy fruit flavors and supple mouthfeels, 2014 is a ""classic"" Bordeaux vintage and what's great for people who like ""classic"" flavor is that ""classic"" is considered less exciting these days. Everything has to be the ""vintage of a lifetime"" or no one cares. Fine by me!!!!! I'll gladly take 2014 Haut de Poujeaux for sub-$20 pricing if ""classic"" claret is no longer desirable. This is an absolutely delicious Bordeaux (that tastes like Bordeaux!) with a complex and aromatic nose of oak, earth, and spice. After ten minutes in the glass there's a hint of red currant, but it's modest. The wine's strength is in its simple typicity - it's a Wednesday night claret that I would be happy to bring to dinner on Saturday evening. There's an old story about how Baron Rothschild mistook the 1953 Poujeaux for Lafite. If I would have tasted this blind, I would have easily mistaken the 2014 Haut de Poujeaux for a much more serious Bordeaux. For fans of classic, true-to-form Bordeaux with texture and nuance, this is a fantastic deal.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The Haut de Poujeaux is one of two additional labels from the Moulis estate—Salle de Poujeaux and this one.  We have carried both and have found no difference in the quality. The wine has toasty, oaky aromas, and after decanting it opens up to a red fruited beauty, both forward and delicious. An absolutely great wine to enjoy now.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Considering the age, the quality, and the overall value, this Bordeaux is a steal. With Merlot being the dominant variety in this blend, this bottle is easy drinking, approachable, and fantastic for beginners who are willing to explore more from the region. Definitely give this bottle a whirl!

"“Violets and blackberries with hints of spices on the nose. Full body, with soft and velvety tannins and a juicy finish. Drink now or hold. Always an excellent value.” JSI love this wine—sweet and lovely, a bit modern and 100% delicious. Nicolas Thienpont is the great winemaker here. I agree with James.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Don't get fooled by its pretty violet aromatics. The d'Alix is a wine for the cellars, despite its price. It possesses the classic earthiness of Pessac, along its fruit core. It is serious and needs time in the bottle or a good decanting. Great buy.

"Wow! this is a delicious spicy red with great finesse and elegance. An easy drinker and the first time we have bought it.  We found this gem on the 2017 Bordeaux trip.

"The Silver Oak Napa Cabernet Sauvignon is a testament to the quality Napa wines can achieve with precise winemaking and the pristine fruit of the Valley.  It showcases ripe, savory red currant, cherry and raspberry fruit flavors with slight thyme and rosemary herb elements. The French oak is well integrated and lends a subtle spice profile to the elegant wine.  The tannins are still strong, and combined with the great acid, will help this bottle age beautifully for years.

"The 2012 Napa Valley bottling has been wildly anticipated for the last few months. Hot off of the fall release of the stunning 2012 Alexander Valley bottling, The Napa bottling has finally arrived. The first in a string of three outstanding Napa Cabernet vintages it is wildly apparent from the nose that this is a hallmark 2012. Known for its generosity and ripeness 2012 has charmed people over the last couple of years but its wines like the Silver Oak that vintages like these are really judged on. Dark but with a juicy core of blue/black fruit highlighted by espresso and sweetened cocoa powder the nose here resonates and has plenty of weight and concentration. This enters velvety and full bodied and shines as it rolls along to the mid-palate. Full of swirling and complex flavors of brambly wild berry, chopped green olives, blueberry angel cake, pipe tobacco, and homemade chocolate brownies this is gulp-able and yet serious at the same time. Finishing with its signature oaky pinning and considerable tannin, fruit rather than oak, this is one stunner of a wine and easily the best Silver Oak Napa Valley bottling since 2007 or 2009. In a word: Tremendous.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is the best du tertre I have ever tasted out of barrel.  They lowered the % of Cabernet Franc and the wine sings. Tons of bright red currant aromas with a touch of violet on the nose. A big mouthful of fruit mixed with some asian spice and cassis. Long and lingering and a great buy.

"It's the bread and butter of our business here at K&L: Napa Cabernet that tastes like classic Napa Cabernet for a price that represents quality without breaking the bank. Sound familiar? We get asked for recommendations like this more than 50 times a day, so personally it's always exciting when we find a great answer to that never-ending request. 2013 was a magical vintage for Napa and the proof is in the pudding here with this Louis Martini release, one that offers all the hallmarks of textbook California Cab: dark plummy fruit, dusty tannins, a full-bodied mouthfeel, and just enough oak on the finish. It's nothing new or revolutionary, mind you, it's just a workhorse of a wine that brings the bang for the buck. This is the type of wine that restaurants kill for because it's dependable, well-priced, and crowd-pleasing. If you're looking for a new house bottle, this is easily worth a case or two. True-to-form Cabernet of this quality (from this good of a vintage) rarely goes for less than $40 anymore.

"Deep, violet aromas of plum, blackcurrant, blackberry and blueberry. Soft and velvety on the palate supported by fresh, juicy tannins. A delicious and easygoing Napa Cabernet that will please everyone around the table for a great price.

"Classic Napa Valley Cabernet at an affordable price! Louis Martini, one of the five Napa wineries founded after Prohibition in 1933, has been making top notch Cabernet for many years. This 2013 Napa Valley offering will not disappoint. In the glass, this wine is an inky purple-red color with an aromatic nose of plum, fig, blackberry, espresso and earth elements. It's full-bodied with medium tannin, great balance and a long finish. Enjoy this now, or hold on to it for a few years and it will only get better!

"The Josephine de Boyd is one of the second labels of Chateau Boyd Cantenac along with Jacques Boyd.  An elegant 2010: feminine style with some violets on the nose and red fruit flavors.  We carried the Jacques and sold out quickly a year ago.

"The 09 Bel Orme exists on the more lithe and elegant side of the style spectrum, particularly considering the power of the 2009 vintage in Bordeaux. Discreet, measured, quiet red fruited aromas lead to a nicely firm, delicious palate with just enough fruit showing itself. While it will surely handle a steak, this is one of those Bordeaux that you could successfully pair with many other  entrees. Delicious and classy claret.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This earthy ""Old School"" bottle is surprisingly lively and crisp for a 2009 and will appeal to those looking for traditionally made bargain Bordeaux.  The fruit profile is  dark and compact with the faintest whiff of earth and leather on the steely finish.

"What's not to like here!? This is a stunning bottle of Cabernet, ticking all the boxes for the varietal, made by a great producer with a heritage going back centuries and it has a price tag of under $15! Dark blue/black fruit, rich, med-full-bodied texture, refined tannins give the wine great shape and length on the palate. Some leafy tobacco notes add intrigue as does the perfectly judged oak. This is a seriously polished, classy wine for sub-$20...and at our current pricing this is just ridiculous.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"I cannot stress enough the incredible value I think this Cab is for the price it is listed at. It is a legit Cab Sauv with soft oak notes and rich fruit. The tannins are subtle, but the complexity is there, detailing the experienced winemaking, as this is a hard balance to hit. This Cab tastes as though it has aged for years as it holds the complexity I look for with the softness of long-lasting wine. This producer should be on your radar if it's not already.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Earth dark cherry and plum fruit along with scents of fertile soil are the first thing you encounter in this hearty and balanced wine.  This is generous in the middle and finishes with very ripe tannins on the sweet finish.  A wine that truly over delivers.

"At a recent staff tasting, this outclassed the rest of the table in a way that you'd imagine a grand cru to perform at a table of village wines.  Not only is this full of class, refinement, and structure, but I've really enjoyed how 2014 Napanook has developed over the past few months since release.  Coming from the same exact vineyard as the grand vin Dominus, Napanook is still the poster child for value in collectible Cabernet.  Very few Napa wines this good are still found at this kind of price-point, and this fact is exemplified beautifully in the 2014 vintage.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is just a superb wine and I wish that all of Napa could take notice stylistically and balance. The nose of this wine is so complex, so many layers, green olive, leather, spice along with deep, concentrated blackberry. On the palate you immediately see the lift, while this wine has depth, power and structure it’s light on its feet, fresh and finishes on an up note. Years of aging will just add to the nuance of this wine although it is a delight to drink now.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"I wasn't sure I wanted to jump onto the bandwagon, but I'm definitely on board now... Elegant aromas of some sort of violet-y-black-olive-marmalade give this wine a sophisticated sense right upon pulling the cork. Full bodied, but balanced, flavors of blueberry, plums, blackcurrant, and coffee align with a perfectly ripened core. Awesome now, even better in years to come.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"An excellent and seductive Napa  red wine. It has  nice fruit and structure but what is the most important is that it is packaged together with elegance and finesse. It is full bodied and delicious and should please anyone who wants a Napa red that will go well with food.

"It's impossible to believe that the Napanook is a second wine because most first wines aren't this good! And it's impossible to believe that Dominus was able to pull off another amazing showing after their stellar, critically acclaimed year in 2013. Few wineries are able to achieve such critical success two vintages in a row but Dominus is able to pull it off vintage after vintage. The '14 Napanook is classic Bordeaux style. Quintessential aromatics of savory herb, sweet tobacco, graphite and black currants are amply supported by a supple, silky texture that screams finesse. Add a ripe, medium to full body mid-palate and a persistently long finish of black raspberries and violets and you can easily understand why Dominus deserves the respect it gets.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"I love it when wine surprises me! I went in thinking the Napanook was going to be this BIG, RICH, FULL-bodied monster. What I got was an elegant, medium-bodied wine. With wonderful savory and mineral notes, with a host of graphite, floral and dark berry fruit that open up in the glass. Graceful acidity, which is a good indicator that this wine is in for the long hall! So if you can give it a couple of years you will be rewarded.

"A well proportioned, serious wine from the far western edge of Australia, Vasse Felix's Premier Cab has been hand crafted to reflect their unique terroir for more than 35 years.  On the nose you notice the harmony first; a balance in the sum of the parts that make up the bouquet.  As you did deeper you find gentle blackberry and cassis fruit paired perfectly with herbs like mint, bay leaf and a loose pipe tobacco.  On the palate a solid structure takes shape with ripe tannins holding a brambly blackberry pie that has a dried citrus twist and wafts of a tobacco and tea.  Clearly 35 years of experience has allowed them to dial in a precision Margret River should be proud of.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Vasse Felix has a long history in Margaret River and their Cabernet is consistently one of the better red wine values within the region. Under the direction of winemaker Virginia Willcock, the Cabernet is a tad more opulent and approachable in its youth yet manages to retain its depth, structure and longevity. It's a very solid pick for Cabernet lovers and a definite choice for anyone looking to try Australian Cabernet for the first time.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"A wine of serious proportions. This has enough richness and power to appeal to Napa Cab drinkers but a structure and length more akin to great left bank Bordeaux. Deep saturated black and blue fruits abound; blackcurrant, cassis, damson plum wrapped up in shaved cedar, cigar box, toasted spices and subtle vanilla oak polish. The fruit is rich but ample tannins mean this will go the long haul. The best Vasse Felix Cab I've tasted in years. I'm just astounded we can offer it at this price. Given the quality, pedigree and ageing potential this is a steal.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"I've become quite fond of Margaret River Cabernet Sauvignon. It has plenty of fruit, body and structure that is just so fresh, precise and elegant. This bottle in particular offers such a variety of aromas and flavors: violets, black currants, cherries, pencil lead, eucalyptus in the nose. Cassis, tart cherry, dark cocoa, cedar and black pepper on the palate. The tannins are delicate and the finish lasting. A distinctive and delicious wine.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends

"Margaret River is known for producing some killer Cabernets and the Vasse Felix is an amazing example of that reputation. While this wine is still a baby and can certainly be held for years to come, it is showing amazingly well now. It has great structure and power, with deep fruit notes and slight acidity to balance it out. This Cab competes with any other region in terms of outstanding quality and will certainly find a place in my cellar.

"This vintage is stellar. It is sourced from the same vines as the ultra-premium Insignia and aged on a unique regimen of half-French, half-American, half-new oak barrels.

The tannins are smooth yet powerful and the great acidity ensures that this gem will age beautifully for years to come.

"Every Bordeaux producer I've spoken with thinks 2014 will be looked back upon as one of the best value vintages of the last two decades. Currently sitting in the shadow of 2015/16, two harvests with HUGE scores, it's a vintage that's getting lost in the crowd, which is a good thing for those of you who hunt for value. 2014 is classic Bordeaux through and through, and it was an especially good year in Pessac-Leognan, a region from which I've tasted dozens of incredible cuvees for less than $50. The 2014 Malartic Lagraviere was right there with the Domaine de Chevalier in my book for value of the vintage. This wine has equal amounts of dark cassis, herbaceous character, and fine tannic structure, but it still needs time to congeal. Buy six of these, throw them in your cellar, and forget about them for a decade. Then call us back in 2027 and tell us how happy you are.

"If you're in the market for Bordeaux, you shouldn't miss the '06 Cantemerle. If someone was willing to subsidize my wine collection, I would by multiple cases of this gem. Remarkably affordable, this may very well be THE wine of the vintage.

"I have written a lot in these staff reviews about the virtues of wel-balanced claret, and if you have patience to wait 6 or 7 years, I believe this wine will come to epitomize that virtue. Anyone with a cellar and a love for Cabernet-based wines should strongly consider this wine for a case purchase. Clyde, Alex B, Alex P, Ralph, Joe Z, Steve and I tasted through an entire ballroom of 2006 Bordeaux at the UGC tasting this January and all of us agreed that the Cantemerle was one of the stars. I thought it was THE star, since the other wines in its class were all more than twice its price, and many wines three times its price could not even touch it! It is perfumed, layered, cassis-driven and framed (but in no way dominated) by oak on the nose and follows through with richness that is not at all overweight on the palate. It is great Bordeaux for a small price; all you have to do is cellar it!!

"Tasting this today, I was floored by the breed and stateliness of this young claret. This third wine of Latour has the classic flavors of the first wine with lead pencil and cassis in perfect, classy balance. What it doesn't have recommends it even more- this is not a tannin bound wine like Latour proper would be at this age, but rather and open knit, delicious drinker. If you ever wondered what a first growth is all about, but didn't want to part with a grand, treat yourself to this!

"We were fortunate enough to visit Château Latour during our 2016 En Primeur trip and I was pinching myself from the second we stepped onto the property. I never expected to see the actual fort of Les Forts fame (the second wine of Latour) in person, let alone step foot in the tasting room of this legendary estate. Latour is one of this world's greatest wines—many people consider to be the best. As we walked inside to our appointment, at the end of the table—following the 2016 line up—was the 2012 Pauillac de Latour, the estate's third wine after Les Forts. Upon tasting, I was immediately transported back to when the first 2012s were reaching US shores and arriving at K&L. This wine reminded me of how much I loved that vintage. A wonderful expression of harvest and the château, it displays lovely purity of fruit and that characteristic 2012 bright fresh acidity. A combination of complex savory, mineral tones and exotic spice dominated the seamless offering. The wine has wonderful poise and polish, with the Latour thumbprint throughout.  What a treat!

"An “appellation” wine from First Growth Chateau Latour in Pauillac. Each year, after the initial selection is made for the Grand Vin, and for the second label, Forts de Latour, some of the remaining lots are used to produce this 3rd label. Also included are grapes from some of the younger vines on the estate, as well as from outlying vineyards. The “Pauillac” bottling will usually include a higher proportion of Merlot and is intended for earlier consumption, requiring less aging than Latour’s more prestigious labels. We tasted the 2012 Pauillac de Latour at the chateau in early April. It was good enough to compare very favorably with a barrel sample of the excellent 2016. Very much in the Latour style – structured, bold, black-fruited. Very generous with loads of sweet fruit and good concentration. Tannins are quite fine. Drinkable now or over the next decade. Given the pricing for First Growths these days, this wine represents one of the great bargains in Bordeaux.

"The third wine of Chateau Latour is a classy, classic and affordable Pauillac to drink now or hide away for a few years.

And from a winemaker regarded by his peers as one of the very best in the business having crafted multiple 100-point wines in the past few years. Need I go on? Did I mention that we have the best pricing in the country? This is a serious wine built with power and structure; packed full of dark fruit, briary notes, gravelly minerals, shaved cedar, pipe tobacco. Stylistically this sits somewhere between Napa Cab and Left Bank Bordeaux...but really it's pure Gimblett Gravels...a terroir that I believe commands just as much respect as either of the aforementioned regions. Drink now with a bone-in rib-eye or cellar for 10 years comfortably.

"This is a rockin' Bordeaux Blend for the incredible sub-$20 price point and an incredible steal given the scores on this guy! Hawke's Bay is absolutely killing it with the Bordeaux reds they are putting out right now and Trinity Hill is one I will go back to easily time and time again because of their consistently phenomenal wines. This blend is structured, yet approachable, with deep fruits and a subtle earthiness. Wonderful any night of the week, no need to hold this one for a special occasion, though it would be welcome there as well.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The term ""Bordeaux blend"" is entirely apropos here because the new Trinity Hill ""Gimblett"" is very much like a restrained and elegant Pessac-Leognan, but for a smashing price of $19.99. There's a deepness and richness of black fruit from the Cabernet, a faint mineral note from the stony soils (a la the Graves), and a plushness from the Merlot that rounds out the finish. It's a finely balanced blend, and one that showcases the potential of Hawke's Bay as a serious destination for claret. Try this on your next steak night and see what you think.

"The second label of Varner is, in my mind, one  the best values in California wine. The Foxglove Cab is simply a super friendly, easy to drink, everyday Cabernet. Dark and red berry notes are balanced by a light, fresh acidity due to the stainless steel fermentation. Lovely fruit and spice open immediately and lead to a lovely finish.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is big, bold and balanced with a middle of sweet cherries, cola, spice and a long, ripe finish.  With decanting this is delicious today but will only get better.

"Very Gruaud-Larose nose with herbs, tea, and cigar.  Red fruited with good detail and moderate tannins.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"**Don’t Miss** Very elegant, fresh, and balanced with complex notes of tobacco leaf, wild flowers, black plums and brambly dark berries. The high percentage of Cabernet Franc contributes complexity and finesse and the whole cluster fermentation adds elegant floral aromatics. Major investments have been made in the vineyard, cellars, and winemaking facilities since the Groupe Pichet purchased the Chateau in 2010.  The fruit is fleshing out while maintaining its unique signature and complexity. Les Carmes Haut-Brion is reaching its potential and on the rise.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Super Tuscan at a super price. This bad boy is made up of Cabernet Sauvignon,  Merlot,  Montepulciano, and Alicante, and I swear you can taste all of these. On the palate you will find flavors of black cherry, plum and soft floral notes blended with silky tannins. The Cabernet gives this a backbone you can feel and a nice smooth and long finish.

"This super value 2015 comes from just north of St. Estephe. It not only has the ripeness and power that make this vintage a wine critic favorite, but also the focus that will bring real pleasure at the table. These 2015's will be hard not to drink young, they have so much nice fruit and are incredibly open right now. I say buy some for now and some for later!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The less expensive wines from the great 2015 Bordeaux vintage are starting to arrive and this hearty and fruity bottle is a great example.  The alluring aromas of ripe raspberries lead to a deeply fruited and substantial body of dark fruit and mineral.  The substantial grip on the finish suggests cellaring for a few years but the plush and sweet fruit make this difficult to resist with hearty food.

"So, you like Ridge Vineyards “Monte Bello” Cabernet but you can’t afford it? Fair enough. Luckily they have created just the thing to keep you satiated. The 2014 Ridge Vineyards “Estate” Cabernet Sauvignon is a declassification of numerous lots off the Monte Bello Vineyard, which includes some of the replanted “young vines,” and is treated in the cellar exactly the same way as their flagship bottling. For years now we’ve touted this beautiful, classic California Cabernet to our in-store customers and we feel like it is time to inform a larger group of our customers just how good this wine is before it is gone. Big, powerful aromas of Asian plum, sweet pipe tobacco, boysenberry and warm spice fill the dark yet friendly nose. With a similar concentration to the famed Monte Bello bottling but not as integrated or lengthy, I mean what do you expect for $125 less a bottle, this is superb Cabernet full of the savory components of the Santa Cruz Mountains and with layers of blackberry, clove, toasted marshmallow, fennel and a resonating purple flower note in the finish. There is certainly a reason this is one of the staff’s favorite Cabs year in and year out.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Ridge Vineyards wines always seem to deliver. This 2014 Estate Cab. is no exception. It offers nice dark fruits that are rich and delicious but it is not too ripe or jammy. It is a dry wine that is a classic California Cab. I think that it will be best with hearty foods.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"It seems like only the other day we were all crooning over the 2013 releases from Ridge, yet here is another pristine Cabernet from the ""Estate"" line. 2014 keeps up the same excellent quality and depth that we have all come to expect from the Estate Cabernets, showing lovely resin, rosemary, and green olive aromas, with excellent, full-bodied dark fruit, lithe tannins, and well-placed acidity that highlights rather than overshadows the fruit. I highly encourage all of you to pick up a bottle or two or six! Always under-rated next to the more famous ""Montebello"", the Estate Cabernet is quite exquisite, and one not to be missed!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"At our staff tasting of 4/4/2017, this (and three other wines) were my favorites out of about 30 selections. Super big nose of black cherry and boysenberry.  On the palate, however, super structured with fine tannin and oak. Black plum, dark red fruits and the (just right) amount of earth and tobacco make this one of the best vintages of this wine that I have ever tasted.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"I've been buying this wine every year since I first started working at K&L and this 2014 edition might be my favorite edition thus far. It's absolutely lovely. There's plenty of plush plum and dark berry fruit, but with that acidity and earthy spice that make Santa Cruz Mountain cabernet what it is. It's full and supple on the palate, but again that weight doesn't overwhelm or throw off the balance in any way. This is a great mid-range bottle of serious CA cabernet.

"This wine was poured blind at a luncheon hosted by Alfred Tesseron at the chateau during the 2016 en primeur tastings last year. The crowd of wine professionals from around the globe was entirely stumped, never guessing they were enjoying the 2007 Pontet-Canet. Such incredible purity of fruit, so sweet, so ripe. Utterly charming. And, let's face it, an amazing value. A star of the vintage!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This was Pontet Canet’s first vintage to go full biodynamic, which, given the difficult growing conditions, makes this bottle a “petit miracle.”  What a beautiful nose!  Black cherry, leather, violets, baked blueberries, a hint of toast.  The fruit is still quite fresh and given the structure and balance, this bottle will age for years to come.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"What an incredible deal on this wine and producer when you consider the 2009 vintage of the same wine costs $200 more. While not the most lauded vintage, this wine is still absolutely incredible. It has a great balance of fruit and savoriness, good concentration, and some quintessential Bordeaux minerality to back it all up. The biodynamic practices exhibited by this winery may make vintage more difficult, but have improved the wine quality beyond bounds. This is a great deal and a standout from the 2007 vintage, not to be missed.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This dark and punchy wine has a deep core of purple fruit that shows off the power of the vintage.  The firm and intense middle of blackberry leads to a finish of very ripe tannins that will allow further ageing although those with a decanter need wait no further.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Once a wine in the lafite stable of fine wines (notice the label), this property did exceptionally well in 2010. Big and powerful wine with lots of red berry fruit. Decant two hours before serving tonight or age it a year or so.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"La Cardonne is ready to drink, with a lovely expanse on the palate and a fine but firm tannin. With a bright acidity, this wine also shows potential for cellaring. Notes of dried blueberry, blackberry, bell pepper and allspice make for a heady and satisfying experience.

"The very first wine I bought for my cellar from this historic 2010 vintage. The 2010 Cantemerle, Haut-Medoc embodies everything that is great about the vintage - astonishing depth of color and flavor, big fruit, profound structure. One of the rare Haut-Medoc chateaus to be included in the classification of 1855 this cinquieme cru is one of Bordeaux's great values. Don't miss a chance to add some to your cellar.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Without a doubt the best Cantemerle since the legendary 1949. Packed with cassis fruit with perfect acid balance and plenty of latent tannin to insure twenty more years cellaring.  But you can drink it now with 2 hours decanting.  More approachable than most 2010 Bordeaux.  I love it.PS-please also look at the 2015 that is selling on futures-right up there with the 2010.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"52% Cabernet, 35% Merlot, 8% Cabernet Franc and 5% Petit Verdot. Nice pure bright red fruit, good structure with big tannins and high acidity. This is a good wine for under $40 that is built to cellar.

"For as young as this wine is, it is already showing its great potential.  This wine is already displaying elegant floral aromas and blue fruit, with integrated juicy tannins.  I look forward to laying down the 2010 Cantemerle for a minimum of 5 years, and enjoying it for many years following!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This was one of my favorite wines in our staff Bordeaux tasting in Hollywood, with black fruit, spice and coffee peeking through, with just the faintest hint of eucalyptus. The fruit, acid and tannins were all completely in balance. This is going to be a showstopper in a decade, and for the price it's a no-brainer.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"**One of the wines of the vintage** Savory with deep cherry, black currant and cassis with floral lift. This has an intense, polished and pliant mid-palate with iron minerality.

"The 2013 Inglenook Cabernet is a gorgeous bottle of wine that drinks well above its price. It is composed of all-estate fruit with 93% Cabernet Sauvignon, 3% of Cabernet Franc, 3% Petit Verdot and 1% Merlot with 50% new French oak barrel aging. This wine shows exceptional balance with rich dark fruit that is nowhere near overdone, finishing with dusty tannin and medium acidity. Additionally, there are more layers of graphite, meatiness and cedar. Grab a couple to age in cellar... if you can wait that long!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Previously known as Cask Cabernet and made from the same estate fruit as the Rubicon, the big difference between the Rubcon and what is now known as simply the Inglenook Rutherford Cabernet is the barrel selection and the use of both American and French oak. While it doesn't have the sweet spices or the exotic scents from that heavier French oak influence, what you get from the standard Inglenook is a wine that has every bit the quality of the Rubicon in terms of fruit, structure, and concentration, but for a price that's about 70% less. The Rubicon typically sells for $170 - $200, but in no way are you settling here taking the Inglenook at $59.99. This wine has an incredible bouquet of dark, juicy Cabernet fruit as well as ripe tannins that reflect the impeccable quality of the 2013 growing season in Napa. However, whereas many of the $50 -$75 wines I taste from Napa today are meant to drink now, the Inglenook is a wine with loads of potential beyond 2017. It has the guts for a serious ten to twenty year run in your cellar, but with some decanting and a nice rib eye you can definitely coax all that gorgeous fruit out of the bottle and into your glass tonight. While my professional opinion would be to wait as long as you possibly can, I'm fully aware that wines this tasty tend to get opened in the short term. Either way, you're going to be very, very happy with the Inglenook.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The evidence is in the glass...Inglenook is officially back to its glory days of the 40s, 50s & 60s with the 2013 Inglenook Ruther Cabernet Sauvignon. This used to be called the ""Cask"" Cabernet Sauvignon but now enjoys the Rutherford moniker. The barrels for this wine were culled out of the production of the Iglenook Rubicon the winery's flagship offering. This is an impeccable red, with perfect harmony of tannins, fruit and structure. A gorgeous red, this has the ""old-school"" Napa Valley cabernet Sauvignon feel that we're always looking for.

"Love it! 2 stars for now and possibly 3 for Pape Clement Rouge (Very impressive all 3 times tasted. Layers of dark grapey fruit all in good focus and with nice freshness, fine tannins,lenght and great taste!).
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"One of the great properties in Pessac-Léognan, historic, renowned, a near neighbor of Chateau Haut-Brion. In recent years, the estate has been moving towards a more terroir-driven style, taking full advantage of its exceptional position in the northernmost part of the appellation. The 2016 Pape Clément is a nuanced effort, complex and layered with good concentration and length. Deeply colored, intense. Lovely weight with perfectly ripe, sweet fruit and fine tannins. Deftly seasoned with spicy oak that enhances rather than overwhelms the wine. Very well done.

"Another winner for Bernard Magrez and his team. His 2015 was one of our best selling wines and 2016 is just as good.  Earthy elements in the nose and on the palate. Quite spicy and some fine tannins on the finish. This wine will need some time even though it is lush on the palate. They released 20% less than normal this year because they were severely affected by the late April frost. Just a warning to he who hesitates-you know what happens.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This wine is exceptional and I have a soft spot in my heart for Sociando as it was the first Chateau in Bordeaux I ever visited in 1985.  This 2016 is far better than the 1984 we tasted on that cool April day in 85.  This one has an intense blackberry aroma.  Very full-bodies and powerfully built for the cellar-yet there is a lot of sweet fruit on the mid palate and at the end.

"Coastal Tuscany has been the center of the Super Tuscan revolution for decades; the warmer, more consistent climate allows the late ripening Cabernet Sauvignon a chance for complete physiological maturity. The initial burst of Super Tuscan activity was near Bolgheri but since that time the more southerly coast near Grosseto, about an hour drive south of Bolgheri, has become a hotbed of growth. One of these producers the Mazzei family, owners of Castello di Fonterutoli in Chianti Classico, bought land in the early 1990’s in the hills just a bit south of Grosseto. The family looked for years for the right location to buy and found it, the property lies nestled in the gentle hills less than 10 miles from the Tyrrhenian Sea. The Tenuta Belguardo is a blend of 90% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc aged for 18 months in French barrique. The wine’s nose is classic cabernet, pencil shavings, cassis with bits of cigar box but behind it some dense fruit. On the palate the wine has the breadth one would expect in Cabernet but its Tuscan heritage adds length to balance, more fruit shows on the palate than in the nose and it is deeper and darker. The finish is fine, elegant balance with a bit of lift in the finish. Super wine, capable of aging for 20 years.

"Senejac is THE one super bargain that should be in the wine cellar of every serious collector of fine Bordeaux.  Closed and powerful in youth, this amazing value always seems to blossom into a rich chewy wine of wonderful depth and flavor.  Although this sub $20.00 bottle has the ability to develop for another 5+ years in a cool cellar decanting tonight will give you a hint of what to expect.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is a great addition to any cellar, the only problem with the wine is that it tastes too good now! The 2014's have a fresh lift to them that makes them almost irresistible young, but should prove to keep them drinking nicely for decades. I love the purity of the Cabernet cassis aromas and flavors in this Chateau Senejac, as well as the long, bright finish. Pair it now with grilled skirt steak or bury it in the cellar for decades to come- either way you will be very happy. At this price, why not do both?
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is dark and fresh with raspberry, currant and earthy aromas and good middle weight.  There is a smooth, plush texture with no edges or noticeable tannin and good ripeness on this easy to drink bargain.  A ready to drink wine with a lot of life ahead.

"If a bottle of Léoville Las Cases represents first growth quality at half the price, I’d like to add that Château Léoville-Barton offers a chance to taste the Léoville estate quality for half the price of Las Cases. Let’s look at the 2014 vintage offerings as an example. A first growth bottle of 2014 Margaux will run you about $450, and a bottle of the 2014 Las Case originally sold for $150; however, the outstanding 2014 Léoville-Barton will only cost you $70 in comparison and if you look at the reviews from the industry’s most renowned critics, I think you’ll see raves across the board. It's because of this understanding of the Léoville property's history that insiders gravitate to the Barton expression. To use a whiskey comparison, the so-called “first growth” of Bourbon at the moment is Pappy Van Winkle, but since it’s either prohibitively expensive or hard to find, customers have gravitated over to the Weller 12 year—a whiskey made from the same stocks, but at a much lower price. In my opinion, a bottle of Léoville-Barton represents the same sort of secret value for true Bordeaux lovers who can’t afford Latour, appreciate Las Cases, but want to stretch their money as far as it can go. When putting together my shortlist for 2014 cellar contenders, the Léoville-Barton was right at the top of the list with Haut-Bailly and Domaine de Chevalier. The other endearing fact about Léoville-Barton is that it still remains in the Barton family’s hands, run today by Anthony Barton while his sister Lilian handles the Langoa estate. According to Peppercorn, both properties have been in the ownership of a single family for longer than any classified growth in the Médoc. In an age where a number of prestigious properties are being snapped up by foreign investment groups and corporate luxury conglomerates, it’s nice to know that some producers are continuing a family tradition put into place hundreds of years ago. I was thinking about this legacy when tasting the 2014 Léoville-Barton again earlier this week, the dark color brooding in the glass, representing the lifeblood of one of Bordeaux’s most historic dynasties. The wine is absolutely brilliant on the palate with dusty tannins, understated minerality, and a lush layer of hoisin, dark cherry, and grippy graphite. There’s a lot to wrap your head around in every bottle of Léoville-Barton, from the history of the terroir to the heritage of the Barton family's stewardship. For those looking to expand their understanding of Bordeaux, you get a lot of wine and wisdom for your hard-earned money.

"2015 Poujeaux is a perfect example why this wine has been a top selling wine here for decades. Beautifully polished, ripe sweet fruit with classic structure. The kicker here is the exquisite balance this wine always possesses. A serious wine of great taste; along with Cantemerle a candidate for the best value in left bank Bordeaux wine!

"I always find this wine in a masculine style. Dark black fruits, with lots of licorice in the mouth; the 2015 still has those characteristics but is a bit more open and approachable then I normally find it at this young stage. Ripe, sweet middle fruit are still followed by some grippy tannins, but this all should come together in the bottle.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"A fine, elegant, well-balanced claret from a producer that has become the darling of the K&L staff. Along with Cantemerle, this is a wine I've started buying almost every vintage since 2009.

Another fantastic value from Poujeaux and another wine I'll be buying at least a case of.

Tremendous passion, proficiency and enthusiasm translate to a wine that will not disappoint. Notes of Asian spice, flowers, bay, cedar and minerals leap from the glass, leading to supple and sweet palate impression. This wine displays great follow through, given its perfect balance of fine tannin and fresh acidity. Incredibly complex for the price, the 2016 Labegorce is sure to please.

Very feminine style-so precise.  SO DELICIOUS. A must buy-it will sell out quickly.  As good as it gets for any wine from anywhere for this price.

"Chateau Labégorce is unapologetically swimming against the tide in 2016 with a blend that is majority Merlot in a vintage dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon. 52% Merlot, 38% Cabernet Sauvignon, 6% Cabernet Franc, and 4% Petit Verdot. The Merlot adds a bit more mid-palate breadth here and perhaps a bit more sweetness of fruit, but at a mere 13.5% alcohol the wine is by no means over-ripe. It is, quite decidedly, perfectly ripe. Precisely so, in fact, and in perfect balance with the lively acidity and ultrafine tannins which this 2016 Labégorce shares with the best wines of the vintage. Perhaps the best ever from this estate, and unquestionably one of the great bargains in Margaux today.

"When he is not consulting for the likes of Chateau Ausone, La Mondotte, or Yquem, Paul-Marie Morillon makes wine on his own property of Lafont-Fourcat, as he has done since 1993.

Jean-Luc Thunevin, owner of Chateau Valandraud and infamous “garagiste”, distributes the wines.

"If you buy Bordeaux from K&L, you undoubtedly know Chateau Cantemerle. As a sales staff, we all secretly hope to find a bottle amongst the lineup for our quarterly Bordeaux staff tastings. Some of us will even drop hints to Clyde, hoping he will blind taste us on an older vintage from his cellar. Needless to say, tasting the fabulous 2016 offering at the chateau was close to a religious experience. This is by far one of the best wines I have tasted from this beloved chateau. Aromatically there is so much intrigue - loads of cinnamon, raspberry fruit, cedar and spice. The palate delivers rich sweet fruit, silky edges and wonderful freshness.

"Chateau Cantemerle was classified a Cinquième Cru in 1855, one of only five chateaus designated “Haut-Médoc” to be awarded cru classé status. With nearly 100 hectares of vineyards it is one of the largest estates on the Left Bank, and all I can say is, thank goodness. Even with yields slightly above average, I worry there won’t be enough of the 2016 vintage to go around. 2016 is a remarkable vintage in many respects, but one of its most compelling features is the tendency to bring out in the very best wines something quintessential, a perfect expression of terroir. I think the 2016 Cantemerle is one such. It brings together all of the best aspects of the vintage – an extraordinary intensity of color, wildly expressive aromatics, lively acidity and very fine tannins. And the fruit? As a child, I used to spend the summers in Maine, and I used to go blackberry picking with my grandmother. She preferred to go early in the morning before it got too hot. The berries would still be cool with a bit of the morning dew still upon them. Even under my grandmother’s watchful eye, not every berry made its way into my pail. I still remember quickly popping them into my mouth and that astonishing all at once burst of tartness and sweetness. Tasting “fresh-picked blackberry” in this wine made me smile with the memory it evoked. And I have no doubt that 2016 will be remembered as one of the great vintages for Cantemerle. 52% Cabernet Sauvignon, 39% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Franc, 4% Petit Verdot. Tasted twice with consistent notes.

"This is currently a go to Bordeaux bottle for me. Unsurprisingly it is from my favorite commune, St. Julien, which continues to be home to some of the most elegant, wonderfully savory and textbook value examples of left bank Bordeaux.  This 2012 shows the supple red fruited qualities of the vintage, with lovely floral undertones and admirable balance. Thinking of this wine has me craving a nice steak and reaching for the decanter - not a bad notion for your next Friday evening at home!

"This property is under the radar in Bordeaux-located new Gloria and Branaire Ducru, the terroir can not be underestimated.Fine and silky with pretty aromas and flavors of red currants and earth. Medium body, dense fruit and fine tannins. Superb value!

"One of the many things I love about K&L is that I'm constantly being exposed to new-to-me Bordeaux Chateau that are a terrific value. Today's find: Chateau du Glana. The 2012 has a beautiful sweet fruit nose and palate with lots of cassis and raspberry well complimented by notes of cola nuts. The wines structure is defined by acidic lift and a well integrated spicy oak giving it an overall elegance not often found in a bottle of such modestly priced Bordeaux. I'll be adding several bottles of this great value to my cellar.

"It makes complete sense that the Dierberg family would create two different labels and have two different properties to differentiate between the Bordeaux varietals that go to Star Lane Vineyards and the cooler climate varietals like Pinot Noir and Chardonnay that are labeled as Dierberg Vineyard. Even though the vineyards are only about 20 miles apart, they are two extreme climates for growing grapes and the Star Lane Vineyard in Happy Canyon is the perfect terroir to grow Cabernet Sauvignon and all its supporting characters. Warm enough to reach phenolic ripeness but planted with elevation for right amount of stress and diversity, the vines at Star Lane Vineyard produce the perfect balance of rich, concentrated purple and black fruit along side a full bodied but grippy palate. There's a beautiful pure, rawness to this wine in that it tastes like a Cab, but not some overly polished, overly manipulated wine that's lost a little bit of its soul but an authentic Cabernet Sauvignon that is true to its terroir and place. This is Happy Canyon Cab.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Yummy stuff here; cherry cola, vanilla, crushed plum, and a touch of leather make up the nose. The alcohol is very well integrated, you can take a big sniff without burning your nose. On the palate, this Cabernet is very elegant, balancing it's elements of fruit and spice. I like it because although it would match a meal perfectly, you don't NEED food to enjoy it.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"I've enjoyed Star Lane Cabs for over a decade now and am thrilled to see them getting some long overdue mainstream recognition.  Not only are the wines better than ever, but the pricing is stunning - basically the same on our shelves as they were back in the day.  That probably won't be the case for long considering what's in the bottle with the 2014 vintage.  Beautiful bright acidity carries red and black fruit to go alongside a chalky tannin that's almost reminiscent of Bordeaux.  But the brightness and concentration shows a sense of place and a home in California.  Drink now with a healthy decant, or follow over the next 10 to 15 years.  (83% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Merlot, 4% Cabernet Franc, 4% Petit Verdot, 1% Malbec)

"It’s not often that I taste a California Cabernet that I think is in balance, for I am not a fan of the super unctuous, dripping and oozing types that others might like. Although this isn’t a low alcohol Cabernet it is in balance and that is the first thing I look for in a wine. The nose is full of wild herbs, hints of leather and spice interspersed with bursts of cinnamon and wild cherry, a more Bordeaux like aromatic. Yet in the mouth you can tell this is a California wine, the texture takes over with a supple and richly textured palate feel. The flavors repeat the nose but with a more saturated denseness to them, the wild cherry deepens and lifts the spice. The wine has a restrained and elegant feel to it, lots of acidic lift, super fine grain tannin to give boundary to the Cabernet’s richness. An elegant and balanced take for California Cabernet.

"I don't think I could have named you one producer in the Santa Barbara region making Cabernet until I tasted the Star Lane this past week, but I was surprised by much more than the anomaly of such a thing. This is real deal Cabernet with structure and secondary flavors of earth and tobacco, not just some fruit-forward or simple bottle of California red. Star Lane vineyard, as I would later learn, is planted to 200 acres of Bordeaux varieties and the vineyard differentiates itself from other parts of Santa Barbara County by sustaining warmth. In a region dedicated to cooler climate varieties like Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, that's important. The vineyard also has elevations ranging from 750 to 1550 feet above sea level throughout Happy Canyon, meaning that different grapes grow in different microclimates, creating a diverse crop of fruit. You can taste that character in the wine as the flavors range from dark fruited and powerful, to herbaceous and savory. It's a California wine with the heart and soul of a Bordeaux. Give it time in a decanter and cook up a nice meal. You won't be sorry.

"Originally a neighboring property, Chateau Tour Léognan became the second label of Chateau Carbonnieux in 1956 when the Perrin family purchased both properties and reorganized the vineyards. Today the fruit is sourced mostly from younger vines on the estate. The 2012 Tour Léognan, Pessac-Léognan is typical of the vintage, ripe and round and easy drinking. Loads of sweet dark fruit with notes of mocha and spice. 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 35% Merlot.

"I was very happy when I found myself lucky enough to be handed a bottle of this wine to try. It shows a good amount of soft fruit and the tannins are present, but not overwhelming or harsh. I found it to be very approachable now, which is not always the case with Bordeaux only 5 years old. It has many of the Cabernet characters I look for and I would definitely turn to it for a steak dinner any night of the week, especially at this price point.

The Coombsville AVA has stepped up its quality immensely over the last few vintages and now many of their releases are dollar-for-dollar the best values in all of Napa Valley. The Farella Estate Coombsville Cabernet Sauvignon is loaded with dark chocolate and blackberry kirsch notes along with mocha and espresso flavors this creamy, richly-textured beauty is a hedonist's delight.

"For those of you looking for a serious old-school Napa Cabernet with great structure and aging potential, look no further! The 2013 Farella Estate Cabernet has all the elements of a top-class Napa wine, with a much more reasonable price point. The wine combines lush dark fruit, pungent eucalyptus and mint notes, solid but refined structure, and just a kiss of toasted oak. It's composed of everything you want in a big and bold California Cabernet, without being the slightest bit out of balance or overdone. If you hide this in your cellar for a few years, the result should be stunning.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"If you haven't explored the wines of Coombsville, you certainly should, adding this wine to the top of your list. Farella's Cabernet Sauvignon really showcases the flavor elements of this southeastern Napa AVA with intensity and elegance. There are aromas of graphite, blue and black fruits that carry over to the palate with smokiness and spice. Two thumbs up!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"I was super impressed by the combination of power and poise in this beautiful 2013 Cab from Farella. The wine is bristling with black / blue fruit, briary notes, sweet tobacco, graphite and subtle oak spice. The palate is dense and concentrated but not at all confected or jammy. This has all the power one expects from Napa Cab plus the balance and structure that makes the cooler Coombsville AVA so special. You will see ""Farella Vineyard"" on the labels of many super high-end Napa bottlings...Realm and Lail to name but a few...but this estate, namesake bottling from Farella comes at a fraction of those prices and you can bet they kept their very best fruit for themselves! This is an absolute steal in the world of boutique Napa Cabernet for the highly regarded 2013 vintage.

"Veronique Sanders can do no wrong at Haut Bailly and this property is a star in Bordeaux.A very well-made wine with ripe cherry and cassis notes. Bright fruit and lively acidity balance the  tannins very well, and the finish is long and quite complex. One of the truly great 2014s.

"This was released 5 years ago and what I once considered ""modern"" in style has evolved into a classic with aromas of hot asphalt, toast and intense mixed berries.

"I love how the 2009 Malartic-Lagraviere is beginning to show some of that textbook Gravesian minerality now that it's had some time to shed the baby fat of that ripe 2009 fruit. When we tasted this wine recently you could finally get deep into the iron, graphite and flinty notes that make the wine one of the best expressions of true terroir in all of Bordeaux. The fruit is still there to round out the edges, but the evolution on display here is what makes this wine worth buying. No need to wait; all the aging has been done for you!

"Cultivated on textbook gravel and clay ridges over limestone, this very attractive Cru Classe des Graves continues to evolve in the glass, offering one the opportunity to savor the complex aromas and deep palate of charred earth, ravishing black fruits and well-built, sinewy tannins.

"We recently were lucky to taste through a fairly extensive vertical of this excellent Graves estate's wines and this 2009 vintage was a standout for many of us (including none other than Head Wine Buyer Emeritus, Clyde Beffa, Jr.) Plump fruit shows a rather sumptuous quality, with more deeply pitched mixed berries than the red fruits shown in other vintages we tasted such as 2005, 2010 and 2015.  This is drinking wonderfully now, should have a wide ranging appeal to both the classicists and those who, as Clyde seems to these days, prefer richer fruit. Highly recommended.

"Many 2007 Bordeaux's are in a sweet spot right now, beginning to deliver all the elegance, flavor development and balance one would expect in maturing Bordeaux. Langoa is one of our favorites and this 2007 is spot on: savory, rich cherry fruits and a suggestion of braised meat on the nose  lead to a palate of red fruit and appealing earthiness. A well put together and complete, utterly delicious Langoa.

"At a recent staff tasting in the San Francisco store this wine from the much maligned '07 vintage was fantastic.  Not only did it show better than Langoas from much more hyped vintages, but it beat out several highly rated vintages of its big brother Leoville Barton.  This is velvety,soft and earthy with very sweet fruit and a mineral edge right down the middle.  Decant this and try it tonight.

"I'll never forget the first time I tasted Faust. It was at The Martini House (a once landmark restaurant in St Helena) and it was part of their mid-week burger special; a glass of Faust Cab and a burger for $16. What was amazing wasn't the ridiculous bargain price but how superbly the Faust paired with their rich, fatty, unctous burger. One of the main principles of food pairing is to match styles; light with bright, earthy with savory; acidic with tart; and unctous with rich. And that was exactly what the Faust Cab brought to the table in order to go toe-to-toe with their monster burger. The 2014 hasn't changed much since, and this 2014 is intensely fragrant right off the bat. Deep aromatics of currant, plum and bitter chocolate waft immediately from the glass and prepare you for a palate brimming with luscious  blackberry and black cherry. The kicker at the end is the surprising acidity and structure that help keep this concentrated and full-body Cab able to pair with every occasion and robust meal you choose to throw at it!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is easily one of the best sub-fifty dollar values on the market right now – a wine that Robert Parker described as “deep, wonderfully fruited, rich and savory…” He later admitted after tasting Faust along with Quintessa that it was “probably the best set of wines [he had] yet tasted from the Huneeus family…” Frankly, it’s tough not to believe such a statement after tasting it and knowing that virtually all of the fruit comes from AVAs such as Rutherford, Coombsville, Atlas Peak, Mount Veeder or St. Helena – some of Napa’s most prized valley and mountain terroirs. It’s a beautifully layered, unctuous wine and an absolute steal for the money. In a climate where your entry level Napa Cab is hovering within the fifty dollar price point, you should take a hard look at Faust, as most wines in this category simply lack the acclaim and raw materials to compete with it.

"I confess, d'Issan is my favorite Margaux, and for many reasons. The style is absolutely seductively classic Margaux. Violets, acacia, coffee, mocha. Never heavy, and perfect with dinner! Indeed beautiful.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"What do you say about an historic Bordeaux chateau that has an actual moat? I don’t know if it improves the quality of the wine but with enotourisme on the rise, it seems a sensible precaution. The property has been owned by the Cruse family since 1945, and run by Emmanuel Cruse for the past twenty years. Classified as a Third Growth in 1855, the estate currently has 44 hectares of vineyards designated as AOC Margaux. These are planted to Cabernet Sauvignon (62%) and Merlot (38%) and lie just to the north of the village of Cantenac on the banks of the Gironde River. I ranked the 2009 d’Issan among my top wines of the vintage, and it was one of only two wines from Margaux that I bought for my own cellar. In spite of the ripeness of the vintage, it is nevertheless a very balanced effort with moderate alcohol, superfine tannins, and a lively acidity that lends the wine freshness. It is a wine with a great sense of place, a classic Margaux with telltale violets on the nose and remarkable elegance and grace. 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Merlot. 50% new oak.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Whereas in vintages like 2012 and 2015 I've recommended Chateau d'Issan because of its finesse and its elegance, the 2009 about blew me away recently with its subtle power and surprising muscle for what is normally one of the more feminine Margaux wines. There's still plenty of life left in this wine and it has the stuffing for another ten years in the cellar, but when opened today the lushness of the 2009 fruit is almost too tempting to pass up. Those who like their Bordeaux textured and with a little chewiness on the finish will go crazy for this. It has all the aromatics of what you expect from Margaux with ample fruit and structure, to boot.

"One of the top selling wines of 2016 at K&L was the 2013 Provenance Rutherford Cabernet. It was a wine that perfectly nailed the mix of value, quality, drinkability and label recognition. That combination led us to sell out of hundreds of cases in a matter of days. Needless to say we were very excited about the release of the 2014 vintage from Provenance, we bugged our distributor relentlessly to get the wine in front of us as soon as it was released, and we love what is in the bottle! Where the 2013 vintage of this wine really pushed the boundaries of ripeness, weight and polish the 2014 takes a much more classic approach. In fact this reminded me much more of some of the great wines of historic Napa producers like Heitz, Freemark Abbey or Duckhorn, which makes sense being that long term and founding Duckhorn winemaker Tom Rinaldi founded Provenance back in 1999.  With a pretty brick-ish ruby color and aromatic hues of red currant, chaparral, sage brush and sweet tobacco this is more an exercise in subtlety without sacrificing concentration. With a sappy and round entry and smoothly sanded edges this has all the texture of the 2013 just none of the glycerin driven bombast. Add fully formed flavors of sandalwood, Rainier cherry, hallmark “Rutherford Dust” and pipe tobacco and this is one classic Napa Cabernet that will not break the bank.

Good acid, red berry and bramble, and a touch rustic this wine showcases the grape over manipulation. All of this and the wine is still only $35 which is almost unheard if these days. I believe that this wine may just fly out of here as fast as it did last year.

"This wine is absolutely gorgeous in every possible way: delicate violet notes, soft plum, subtle structure, and an elegant finish. It's everything I expect from high-end Bordeaux, especially from Margaux. The caveat here is you're getting a wine that, in my opinion, completely outshines the 2009 Issan, yet is priced $30 less per bottle. It will easily hold up for a decade or more and should offer stunning complexity once the layers begin to unfold. This wine is a clear and shining example of why vintages must be assessed on a producer-by-producer basis, rather than as general blanket statements.

"This is bold and deep with rich mulberry fruit, hints of savory herb, nice concentration and great balance.  Potensac always tastes of Classified Growth quality and the finish here of  sweet mineral laced cherries and ripe tannin make this taste like a $50.00 bottle.

"2016 Ch. Senejac is a blend of 48% Cabernet Sauvignon 37 Merlot 11 Cabernet Franc and 4 Petite Verdot. I have owned many vintages of Senejac over the years and I always age them 7-10 years out and they always taste great. 2016 is dead on consistent Senejac, fresh, firm red-black fruit, elegant Medoc wine with good acid in an absolutely classic style, which means no fruitball! 1 star.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This was one of the great surprises of the Left Bank in 2016. This wine is so elegant! Notes of bright red fruit, flowers and spice grace the nose. The palate offers purity and depth of fruit while maintaining perfectly polished edges. A lovely wine for a fantastic price.

"From 40 hectares of vines in Le Pian-Médoc, just north of the city of Bordeaux itself. Always solid if occasionally rustic this property has improved markedly in the past few years. The 2016 vintage was one of the standouts among the wines of the Haut-Médoc at the big Maison Joanne tasting in Bordeaux during en primeur week. The blend is 48% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37% Merlot, 11% Cabernet Franc, and 4% Petit Verdot. Impressive weight with loads of ripe, sweet fruit and fine tannins. Best ever from here?
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Wow! This could be the best ever by them--much better than their 2015 or even 2009.  Fine structure from this 48% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37% Merlot blend.  Red berry aromas with a touch of oak. Quite perfumey.  Deep color and great structure on the palate-sweet, long finish.  Superb value for $15.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Here is one of the great bargains of the fantastic 2016 Bordeaux vintage.  This is tight, firm and classy with a strong core of sweet fruit and a very clean finish.  there is amazing persistence to the finish of this seriously good bottle.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is very lively and clean with crunchy red fruit in spades and a touch of spice.  There is a hard candy sweetness to the cherry and berry flavors and a high acid freshness right through the middle in to the somewhat strict finish of fine tannin.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"St-Estèphe really shines in 2016, with the Lilian Ladouys standing out as a top value. Lifted aromatics lead to a lively palate of black fruit, cinnamon, and sweet herbs. Great intensity and a silky mouth-feel persist throughout. A really impressive offering!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"These 2016 St Estephe wines are phenomenal and this one is a great value.  Better than the 2014 by a bit, this wine had black licorice aromas and flavors. Slightly new wave but controlled balance and fine mouth feel. Super spicy notes and a lush texture. Superb value.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"A near neighbor of Chateau Lafon-Rochet, this is a property that in the past few years has become a customer favorite due to its combination of quality and price. The 2016 Lilian Ladouys will no doubt both delight existing fans of the wine as well as win over many new Bordeaux lovers with its generous fruit and overall balance and character. Beguilingly aromatic, a bit floral and a bit spicy. Good underlying structure – lively acidity and firm, fine tannins. Top quality, and very true to the vintage.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Inky-purple. Delicate floral aromas of violet and lavender with black cherry, licorice, and graphite elements. Fresh and juicy,gently extracted cherry flavor. Finishes moderately long with fine tannins. Their best wine in many years.

"**Don’t Miss** Masculine and classic with crème de cassis, black currant, lead pencil, cedar, and truffle.  The perfect marriage of quintessential Pauillac with the vintage’s core of beautiful fruit.  A classic for the cellar and one of Bordeaux’s finest values.

"Aromatic and toasty in the nose, lots of ripe fruit, velvety middle, nice balance and length. Usually a bit tough for my taste but this wine is delicious and well made. Excellent effort in 2015!

"As a lover of fine Bordeaux who is always looking for good values, I am increasingly turning to the 2001 vintage for well-priced wines of excellent quality. I recently enjoyed the 2001 Brane Cantenac, Margaux along with a Friday night dinner of steak frites. A remarkable wine for the vintage, combining better than average ripeness with the telltale acidity that is a hallmark of the '01's. Delightfully floral in typical Margaux fashion. Notes of wild blackberry jam and sweet black plum. Already showing some bottle age with a youthful, purple color shading to garnet and savory notes of leather and tobacco beginning to emerge on the nose and palate. A great price on a Deuxième Cru from Margaux, and a great choice to drink now or hold for a few years. 50% Merlot, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Cabernet Franc.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"92 points Neal Martin: ""Tasted blind at Bordeaux Index’s 10-Year On horizontal. This has a very Pauillac-style, mineral rich bouquet with touches of brine, cedar and pine. Great definition. The palate is medium-bodied with fine definition, gentle but insistent grip with a very cohesive finish with a pointed citric thread that lends it such tension and freshness. Actually I think it is better than 92 points-I love the 2001s

"My favorite Bordeaux writer Steven Brooks recently named Calon Ségur as one of the ten most improved châteaux in Bordeaux after finally transitioning out from under the Capbern-Gasqueton ownership. He notes that much of that progress can be attributed to a man named Dr. Vincent Millet, who came over from Château Margaux as technical director of the property and did a complete investigation into the vineyards on site, retooling the layout of the varietals, eventually resulting in a prettier, more finessed grand vin. Not having an extensive tasting history of Calon Ségur under my belt, I have to take Steven's word for it, but I've tasted every vintage since 2009 and I have indeed noticed that 14/15/16 are remarkable wines in how approachable they are in their youth. Normally you get power and structure in a St. Estèphe claret, but the Calon Ségur expressions have been much more feminine over the years (2015 in particular). Where I have really noticed the improvement, however, is with the property's second and third wines, especially after retasting the 2014 Saint-Estèphe de Calon Ségur again yesterday. At a quarter of the price of the 2014 grand vin, the wine is simply breathtaking in its approachability already. In general, 2014 is a classic vintage. The wines have ample fruit, but ample structure simultaneously. Yet, somehow the tannins seem to melt away in this wine, allowing the gorgeous flavors of cherry and blackberry to take center stage. It's exactly what Brooks describes in his summary of Calon Ségur's improvements: ""seamless fruit and a light touch in terms of extraction, although it’s far from a light wine."" He's talking about the $100 version of Calon Ségur, however. What I'm telling you is that you can enjoy the fruits of the château's advancements for $25, as well. The Saint-Estèphe de Calon Ségur is the best second or third wine value I've yet tasted in 2014 in terms of a wow-factor and a level of complexity. It appears the improvements at Calon Ségur are far reaching.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"A gorgeous little example of how special the seconds can be for your dollar. Ultra drinkable and open, with a slight bit of funky earth and vibrant red fruit. The palate has tons of acid and a medium body but not green or under ripe at all. A beautiful old school claret for drinking now at a stupendous price.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is a ludicrous value in great reds. This third label of Calon Segur has flavors of black cherries and candied strawberries with very smooth rich fruit.  It is medium bodied with great tannins and acid, drink now or lay down for a few years!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Nice lifted aromatics of  cherries and other red fruit, followed by a floral note that makes it a very attractive wine. Good tannin and acid structure, along with its fruit, lend this wine a nice balance. I would enjoy now after decanting, but it can be cellared for sure.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Pape Clement- 56%CS 40M 4CF- As always this wine has very deep, sweet , black- red fruit with an exotic touch and lots of oak. The key here is that the fruit is very pure, the wine is perfectly balanced and the finish goes on and on. Clearly one of the stars of the vintage! 2 Stars from me!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Considering the 2009 is twice the price and the 2010 is almost three times the price, this wine rates a perfect score for value from me.  Much better than the 2009 in my mind, this will eventually garner 100 points from someone. So sweet and sexy with toasty oak and red berry fruit aromas,  Tons of mineral on the palate-Rounded tannins. A substantial wine that you can drink young or old.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"We all said to each other at the chateau while tasting this: ""If Pape Clement comes out under $100 it will be one of the best values of the vintage."" Sure enough we're under $90 now for the pre-order price and that means grab it while it's here. The 2015 Pape Clement is an elegant and refined marriage of 56% Cabernet and 40% Merlot (with 4% Franc) that is incredibly pleasant from the first sip. The fruit is fresh and concentrated, the tannins are fine and supple, and the finish is long and graceful. Some of us had this as a top 10 wine from the entire 2015 Bordeaux vintage. It might be one of the only that comes in under $100.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"One of the wines of the vintage, the 2015 Pape Clement is a stunning wine. At a fraction of the cost of La Mission Haut Brion and Haut Brion this wine should be snatched up! Loaded with deep berry fruit(both blue and purple) as well as spice notes, liquified rock and earth notes the purity here is breathtaking. A classic in the making this is a flat-out fabulous wine.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"A blend of 56% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Franc, this is a seriously good wine. Dark chewy fruit, intensely concentrated, hints of black cherry and smoke but not overdone, spicy, ripe and fleshy in the mid-palate; the finish is long and fresh. Definite buy!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Aye I couldn't believe that this was showing better than the 2005 in the last tasting. The 2005 feels downright shutdown next to this gorgeous and mature 2004. Surely the 05 is still the vintage to hold, but for drinking now there's very little in the store that will offer more for your dollar than the special 04 Langoa. Gorgeous soft black and red fruits, totally integrated and seamless. The ultra elegant style is the hallmark of this special property and the 04 delivers that experience to a T.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is a great candidate for Steak and Claret night this week.  The 2004 is right on point with a great perfume on the nose, then great minerality, black cherries and minty herbs on the palate. The acids have softened a bit and the oak has perfectly integrated with the fruit.  You do not need to wait on this one, it is in a perfect spot right now.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Cinnamon and I drank this for our 13th anniversary (we were married in 2004) with steak frites at the lovely Mathilde French bistro in San Francisco. Today I had it again in our staff Bordeaux tasting, right next to the famous 2005. Both times, this wine exceeded expectations, and I couldn't help but buy a little for myself after this second great surprise! I thought this wine drank far better than the 2005 now, and has none of the green notes that critics of the 2004's complain about. The texture is all there at 13 years, and the fruit is dark, fresh and very well balanced by focussed acidity. If you have a steak dinner in your future, this top class Bordeaux is a great choice!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This over-achieving third growth is dense and somewhat brooding, but there is so much sweetness and complexity it’s hard to resist. There is a Pauillac-like character here with cranberry, dark berries, mineral and a touch of cedar on the firm finish. A bargain.

"From the portfolio of wines of Bernard Magrez, owner of Chateau Pape Clement. Chateau Plaisance is not in Pessac-Léognan but in the Entre-Deux-Mers region, producing red wines under the appellation Côtes de Bordeaux. The 2012 Plaisance ""Cuvee Alix"" is a blend of 75% Merlot, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon, and 5% Cabernet Franc aged 9 months in a combination of tank and barrel, 50% of which are new. Generous, forward fruit here with lovely mid-palate weight and fine tannins. Very true to the ’12 vintage. A perennial customer favorite in the sub $20 Bordeaux category.

"Another delicious and over achieving 2009.  This is juicy and lush with earthy black raspberry cream and dark plum throughout the substantial middle.  Oak shadings, a whiff of cocoa and hints of damp clay round out the the finish.   Typical of this vintage, this can be consumed now or aged for 10 or more years.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Bold powerful and robust nose of dark blackberry fruit, subtle hints of incense and lacquer. Lush, soft and rich on the palate with the tannins totally integrated. A very open and bold style without compromising it's origin or throwing to much sweetness or oak at you.

"I've come to expect nothing but bang for my buck when I drink Poujeaux, whether it's Chateau Poujeaux proper, or Gressier Grand Poujeaux, or Haut de Poujeaux, or in this case Chateau Branas Grand Poujeaux. There are six chateaux in Moulis that use the name Poujeaux and I've found that just about all of them over-deliver for my Bordeaux dollar. Branas is planted to 50% Merlot and you can taste that plumpness in the wine immediately, especially given the ripeness of the 2009 vintage. What the bottle age has done, however, is dial back the sweetness of the fruit, allowing some of the more complex secondary flavors come to the forefront. There's a bit of herbaceousness, but it's integrated beautifully into the supple tannins and lush blackberry flavors. The oak is still there on the nose, but now it's become intertwined with aromas of roasted earth. The wine is like silk on the palate throughout all that complexity, which makes this an easy pick for newcomers to aged Bordeaux. Yet, as someone who has consumed quite a bit of old claret over the years, I'm wowed by the value proposition here. This is a lot of Bordeaux for thirty bucks. A big wine with gusto!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"There's something about the terroir of Moulis, that I find irresistible. The Branas is no exception. Very elegant and soft palate, with notes of cocoa powder, earth, and tobacco. I did decant it before serving and it was marvelous.

"Another sexy, super delicious 2009 from a neighbor of Poujeaux. Spicy and lush on the palate.  Enjoy now or in ten years.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"I love 2009 Bordeaux so it was a pleasure to taste this recently. Although it's big and rich, it has surprisingly fresh acidity and substantial tannins as well. What makes this especially enticing is the full-bodied palate of sweet black fruit and the long finish. It's certainly nice now with aeration but will only improve with a couple additional years in the cellar.

This pretty wine has all the characteristics of St Julien-cola aromas, silky texture, etc. Cassis aromas and just all crushed berry sweetness on the palate. Very close to Beychevelle in style. A must try. First time we have bought this label. Tasted 12/9/17--very lively with a fine minerality on the palate.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This red-fruited bargain is thick and smooth and will remind you of a baby Beycheville even though the fruit is not from St-Julien.  This is fairly hearty and round, with tons of character but no hard edges.

"One of the best efforts from the 2006 Bordeaux vintage. Jean Luc Zuger has been bringing Malescot to the forefront of the Bordeaux scene for the last 20 years.Dark ruby/purple, medium to full-bodied, with superb concentration and moderate tannin, this is a beauty of finesse and substance that should be at its best between 2017 and 2024.

",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Good bones here and you can sense the potential underneath.  Great fruit with Cabernet driven nose of black currant, cedar, mint, and smoke.  Calon Segur is one to watch as the quality of the wines is rising and the property is undergoing a significant investment in the vineyards and winery.

"The second wine of Gruaud-Larose is big and rather brooding at present with substantial red and dark fruits crammed into the chewy textured middle.  This will be very long lived and decanting is recommended at present but the 2nd Growth pedigree in unmistakable.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The 2009 Sarget is - no surprise here - a seriously built and structured wine. That is not to suggest that those who choose to enjoy now (ideally with a 45 minute plus decant) will not get more than their fair share of Gruad Larose style and savor but, rather, simply to say that those who choose to age this wine for another several years (or longer) will be amply rewarded.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"To me, there is little in this world that satisfies like Oakville fruit, and in this beauty, fruit is the star. Aromas of spiced blueberry and ripe and stewed strawberry rise from the glass, buoyed on a waft of fresh shiso leaf, vanilla and blackberry. If that weren't enough, violet and rose floral notes spring forth in an aromatic haze, telling the story of a sunny and dusty terroir that can only be found in the heart of Napa Valley.  With a broad, classic palate with a firm, balanced tannin that cleans up very nicely, this wine lingers pleasantly in a cherry-cocoa trail.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The 2009 Capbern-Gasqueton was my first introduction to this wine, which I loved and happily bought for my cellar. I was elated to taste the 2016 Capbern, and was not disappointed! This is a very serious wine. Beneath a hearty frame lies a core of sweet dark fruit. There is a great deal of intensity here, leading me to believe it will fair well for years to come. By far, a top offering in 2016 value category.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The 2016 Capbern is a big, firm wine with good sweetness to the crisp black fruit, mint and spice infused mid-palate.  There is an ease in the way the middle depth flows into the finish of  dry but ripe tannins.  This is an amazing value and will cellar well.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Their best ever? 69% CS and 24% M plus a touch of CF and PV. Extremely fresh and spicy on the nose and palate. Sweet as heck on the palate. Tastes great now! Very round tannins, but they are there under a lot of fruit.  I much prefer this to the marquis de Calon.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Chateau Capbern, formerly Capbern-Gasqueton, was acquired along with Chateau Calon-Segur by its current owners in 2012. Judging from the quality of this 2016 vintage, the property has surely benefitted from some upgrades and improvements in the intervening years. Spice and floral notes leap out of the glass. The fruit is ripe and sweet and perhaps a bit more forward than some wines from the vintage at 14% alcohol. Combined with lively acidity and very fine tannins, however, the wine exhibits perfect balance, and should require a bit less patience than some of its fellow in St-Estephe. This property is fast becoming a customer favorite for its combination of quality and price. I imagine many will choose to drink this wine sooner rather than later, but it has sufficient structure to make a superb near term cellar candidate.

"Compared to the warm, layered 2009 this seems compact, tense and elegant.  The 2014 may be a bit coiled for Poujeaux but it is vibrant, packed and will age beautifully into a sumptuous and complex bargain.  Its unlikely you will pull a better $30.00 bottle of Bordeaux out of you cellar in 5 or 10 years.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is one of the very best values in cellar worthy wine in the entire store. We tasted this along side the 1998 vintage, which has aged effortlessly, and it rammed home the point of just how wonderfully Chateau Poujeaux does with time. This has the perfect combination of cassis fruit and classy Bordeaux earth that excites me. It is a firm, serious wine with plenty of structure for the long haul. If you have children born in or an anniversary in 2014, I would say that this is a must buy. Wine of this sort of class and length are almost never sold at such a reasonable price!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"I love Poujeaux in almost any vintage.  One of the better values in all of Bordeaux.  This 2014 has plenty of cassis aromas and flavors. Quite sweet on the palate and a lingering finish. At under $30 it is a steal.

"We love the wines from this small property and this 2014 is as good as their 2009. I believe the people at Lafite own this property--no wonder it is so good. Ripe blackberry fruit with fine balance and texture on the palate. Decant and enjoy.

"If your preference in Napa Cabernet is for a big, full bodied wine with liqueur-like ripeness, this is NOT the wine for you. Don't get me wrong. The 2010 Galland Clark Napa Valley Cabernet, at 14.5% alc, is plenty full-bodied. But it also comes with a hint of violets on the nose, and yes, a bit of - my goodness - green pepper. Very fresh and lively in the mouth with notes of fresh blackberry and licorice, this is honest damn Cabernet you can enjoy tonight.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Chateau Perey Chevreuil 2011 St-Emilion is composed of 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon. On the nose you can find exotic dark fruits along with cocoa and a touch of coffee bean. The palate is rich, but medium-bodied and silky. The dark fruit once again presents itself, but with a softer appeal. I'd serve this with a nice rib eye steak or roasted mushrooms.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"I find the Perey Chevreuil one of those Bordeaux that despite its young age, its drinking quite nicely now. It is elegant, classic and ready to go.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Fresh aromas of plum, dark berries, and a touch of fresh ground coffee jump out of the glass, indicating it’s seriousness. A few swirls and the smells only intensify (imagine decanting it for a bit...). On the palate, the wine carries medium weight from it’s streamlined acidity and tame ABV (13%). The texture is soft and juicy, leading to a remarkably well balanced bottle for under $20 with a finish that lingers until the next sip!

"The 2016 Leoville Barton shows dark concentrated fruits, minerals, cedar, allspice and a firm structure. This is a sturdy wine with lots of power. A good cellar candidate!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Year on year, Leoville Barton continues to deliver wines that are firm, structured, and uncompromisingly tannic in their youth. The 2016 is very much on point with substantial, though very fine, tannins. What is particularly striking is the sheer intensity of the color, from palate-staining purple to nearly inky black. Loads of black fruit here as well. Superbly ripe with notes of fresh blackberry and hints of richer cassis. Like many of the Left Bank wines in 2016, Cabernet Sauvignon very much takes the lead here. Patience will be required but this ought to age magnificently.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"All the brooding potential and massive power you expect from this wine but tempered by a roundness of the edges and a fresh lift to the middle.  This is dark and dense looking with a chewy blackberry middle of surprising finesse and a super sweet finish of grainy tannin showing ample tug.  This will need time but it screams potential.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"We loved 1987 and 1997 vintage Bordeaux-restaurant vintages with low scores and low prices combined with great taste. 2007 is 1997 on steroids.

Enjoy the  of the vintage and the richness that jean Luc Zuger extracts from this beauty.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This wine was the tightest of the ’07s despite being decanted two hours before the tasting. Dark berry and currant fruit dominated the nose, with cedar hiding behind. The mouthfeel was a bit astringent, with slightly gritty tannins, but there was plenty of dark fruit, cedar and oak spice. The finish was long, with spice notes dominating and black fruit taking a backseat. There is a lot to this wine, it is just needs more time in the cellar.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Traditional and Old School in nature yet possessing good weigh and texture with enough fruit to carry the day.  Blackberrys and dark currants float over a core of iron and graphite in this deep,dark and rustic wine.  Give this an hour in a decanter and enjoy with a hearty meal.

We have stayed here at least 5 times in the 90s when Henri Van der Voort owned it.Situated near Chateau Latour and Pichon Lalande, Bellegrave has great terroir and this 2014 is not as hard as some older vintages have been. Big Cassis aromas and flavors with some tannin on the finish. Decant and enjoy with Cassoulet.

"the 2015 Croix Mouton Bordeaux from Jean-Philippe Janoueix is an incredible value in Bordeaux! The property has a very long history which dates back to the ancient Romans, and is predominately clay, limestone and alluvial soils, located just outside of the Fronsac appellation. The blend is predominately Merlot blended with a much smaller percentage of Cabernet Franc, and the result is a full bodied, fruit driven and beautifully structured wine with aromas and flavors of green tobacco, high tone red fruit and rose.

"Selecting the correct Napa Cab out of the long lineup in our stores can be about as daunting a task as those menacing scenes in crime movies where witnesses try to pick the right suspect, going from face to face, agonizing, hoping for subtle tics or nervous giveaways. Well, fortunately our wines are not nearly as furtive and have pretty solid alibis, not to mention pedigrees. And given the opportunity, they're ready to spill everything! This irresistible bottle can hardly resist confessing its sources, with historic home vineyards high overlooking Calistoga and spreading down in Oakville, where together they create a wine of impeccable balance, prodigious fruit and integrity. To say the least, this wine is not one of the usual suspects, but an upstanding Cabernet and a treasure to the community of those who appreciate compelling wines. Case dismissed.....

"Crafted from estate fruit from the Turnbull Vineyards in Oakville, this beautifully structured and full-bodied Cabernet Sauvignon is one of the best. With a rich dark hue and palate, this wine shows perfumed aromas and flavors of tamarind, dried rose petal, ripe plum and black cherry, black pepper and vanilla. The liberal use of new French oak is evident in the intensity of the bouquet, but the real star is the fruit, which shows bright acidity and great potential for aging.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Made from equal parts Calistoga and Oakville fruit, this cab has everything people dish out the big bucks for in Napa: beautiful ripe dark fruit flavors of black currants, cassis, and mulberry with graphite notes and plenty of cocoa and tobacco.  Tannins are powerful but silky and integrated, and the great acid gives the rich fruit a refreshing edge.  This is one of the best values in the Valley!

"This is easily one of the purest expressions of Napa Valley Cabernet on the market these days. With fruit sourced entirely from noncontinuous estate blocks ranging from the valley floor to higher elevation sites on the Oakville Bench, you've got all the components to make an outrageously delicious and location specific wine. For less than fifty bucks, this is one to go all-in on.

What do I mean by that? The tannins are full and present but glide across the palate.  This is a wine that will age nicely but I cannot see it lasting long in your cellar because of it approachability.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"One of the truly stunning wines we tasted on our 2017 Napa trip, this dense, ripe and powerfully built Cab has it all, with massive fruit complexity and a modern and generous frame. The boisterous aromas of cut sage, boysenberry and baker’s cocoa meld wonderfully with the layered palate, chock-full of star anise, whole blueberry and the polished earth that comes so frequently from Oakville-based fruit. Add a fun finish full of vanilla-laden oak and a brighter turn of red fruit and tobacco, and this is really a steal for the price.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"**One of the wines of the vintage** Dark and deep robe.  Begins with a brooding, massive core of pure dark fruits, blackberry coulis, crème de cassis, black cherry, espresso crema, and graphite.  Intense and built with a weighty mouthfeel and firm tannins.  For the Cathiards, no detail is overlooked from whole cluster fermentation, gravity flow, optical sorting, and even the state of the art use of satellite imagery to assist in optimal harvest times.  Pessac-Léognan made stunning wines in 2015 and Smith Haut Lafitte is one of the finest.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Smith Haut Lafitte- 63%CS 33M Round and broad with loads of grapey ripe-sweet fruit that coat the entire mouth with hints of licorice and spice. Long finishing and very tasty. Another delicious SHL! 2 Stars!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"I consider anything above fifty bucks to be a splurge bottle, but with Bordeaux anything that drinks as well as the 2015 SHL for less than a hundred dollars is a hot deal! This wine was right there with the Pape Clement for me personally. It's a complex wine--all about the relationship between the fruit and the potent minerality. The tannins are soft and round on the palate and the wine is silky on the finish. Finesse is a word you'll hear a lot when describing the 2015 Bordeaux vintage. There are few better examples than this wine here.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The all black label for the 2015 will represent the 25th year anniversary of the Cathiard’s buying the property. The 2015 is dark, black in color with a rich, nearly exotic fruit profile, hints of graphite, cassis, chocolate and Asian spice. The tannins are fleshy and juicy; this is a delicious wine!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This easy to like bottle shows the quality of the vintage at an easy to digest price.  Husky black cherry fruit, earth, mineral and light smoke fill the slightly rustic middle yet there is good freshness and a fine chalky grip to the finish.  Decant and enjoy.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"A beautiful and expressive Bordeaux that drinks very well now. It is medium to full bodied with nice dark fruits\ flavors that are complemented with subtle earth and mineral notes. Typical of the 2010 vintage, the fruit is balanced with nice acidity which makes this a lively and delicious wine. It will be best with hearty foods.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This 2010 is a keeper for a few years--it is bright and fruity and has round tannins. Much softer than some of its neighbors in 2010.  I love the dominant red fruit flavors.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Very intriguing nose of an intermingling of fruit and woodsy character. The sweet spices of vanilla along the notes of cassis and cocoa. Decant or cellar for a few more years. A very good value.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The nose on this wine is powerful and quite compelling! Honeyed toast, black cherries, cola berry and leather, all integrated wonderfully.  This is a powerful wine from a great vintage, don’t feel obligated to drink it now, it has plenty of aging potential left in it!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"One of  our favorite properties.  This wine rocks with tons of black cherry aromas and flavors. Cellar it a bit.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Just 13.6% alcohol on this-one of the best wines of the vintage.  Surprise! Surprise! Chocolate and spice and everything nice on the nose.  Totally integrated on the palate.  Seamless and pure-lovely texture.  Will age long time because of the balance.  Almost perfect, but it won't be cheap!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Once again the top property in the appellation turns out a classic iron fist in a velvet glove.  This silky, elegant wine is deeply concentrated, impeccably balanced and the picture of finesse.  A sleek, classy and intense wine poised on the cusp of perfection.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"**One of the wines of the vintage** Classically built claret in the finest way.  Dark fruited and complex with scorched earth, anise, violet, cedar, smoke, and mineral.  Iron fist in a velvet glove.  Absolutely love it.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Densely concentrated fruit with hints of graphite, minerals and spice, the 2015 La Mission is very rich and sweet in the mouth yet still shows amazing freshness and purity. Could be a pick for wine of the vintage!

"D’Armaillac- Lovely fruit of lively raspberry, very pure, delicious wine with great freshness and energy!  I really like it. 1.5 Stars Ralph Sands

"An absolute pleasure to be enjoyed right now, with a sweet fruit palate of cherries, plums, and some intriguing spicy notes that certainly elevate this wine to the category of  the not-to-miss wines!

"The second wine of Larcis Ducasse is fat, sweet and plump with lots of cherry and raspberry fruit, hints of oak and limestone shadings on the finish.  This young wine is precocious and already easy to drink.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"A classic St-Estèphe, with lots of exotic spices, a touch of leather, earth and lots of dark purple fruit, cedar,dark fruit and I could go on, and on... Incredibly complex for such affordable wine. Viva 2015!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Owned by the Cazes family. 49% Merlot, 44% Cabernet Sauvigon, 6% Cabernet Franc, 1% Petit Verdot.  Black cherry, plum, and wild berries, medium bodied with moderate tannins.  Great value.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The very pure black-red fruits are indeed very tasty and the tannins are nicely rounded. Tasted twice and it showed like the great value it is both times.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is a great second wine.  Mostly Merlot in the blend-black fruit aromas, full-bodies but balanced perfectly.  Great depth and length.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Very spicy, jammy, blackberry aromas.  Voluptuous wine in the modern style, but with fine acidity to balance.  We sold over 200 cases of their excellent 2015, and this one is as good.  They are making fine juice here.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Mountain Cabernet! This is a big intense Cab that I would recommend to anyone looking who is looking for something new.  While it is not a new product I think this is the most enjoyed incarnation that we have had of this wine in years.  Dark red fruit with a dusty warm chaparral spice like note to it.  It is big and chewy, with ripe tannins and pleasant savory note that really brings out the fruit on a very long finish.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"While I thought all of the Streicker wines I tried were fantastic, this is the one I kept coming back to over and over again. Leaner and more mineral driven than most Cabernets, this went perfectly with my steak dinner as the fruit didn't overwhelm the meal. You can taste the terroir in this one, which is a testament to very little manipulation by the winemakers. A great find in Margaret River Cab, this is a break from the ordinary into the extraordinary. Truly delicious.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Twenty years young-still lively and sweet with a merlot tinge to it. Decant and enjoy with rack of lamb.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"2015 Labegorce, Margaux – Toasty ripe aromas are followed by a sweet and juicy mouthful of fruit. The middle fruit lingers on through to the finish. There is some structure and a fair amount of tannin but the wine is balanced and still fruit driven. Should be a nice pick for mid-term cellaring!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is yet another 2012 that is drinking beautifully now. The red fruits of the vintage seem to dominate over the more typical dark fruits of Leoville Barton's first wine.  With sweet earthy and spicy notes on the nose as well, this is a delicous example of the vintage and of the inherent value in picking a well made second wine from a prestigious property such as Leoville Barton (always one of our favorites).
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The second wine of Leoville Barton is floral and fresh with the same sweet red and dark fruit as the first wine but none of the tannic scale.  This has lots of Leoville character in an approachable style and price.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot, 7% Cab Franc, 3% Pet Verdot. This classic Claret, from the lovely underrated vintage of 2012 provides every bit as much complexity and nuance as both the classed growths Léoville and Langoa Barton. This second wine of Leoville is elegant and polished, displaying red and black fruits and integrated tannins. We found it to be quite approachable and softer than some of the older vintages of this wine. Terrific texture and mouthfeel.  Cellar it for a few more years or double decant it and drink now with a rack of lamb.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"What a classic Pauillac, rich and elegant with an attractive Cabernet Sauvignon nose. As with most 2012's it is more approachable than its young age would led us to believe. Also the very reasonable price it carries, make it a very wise choice for those wanting some Pauillac to either cellar or drink.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"From one of the ""in"" Bordeaux regions for value wines. This property is the home of Stephane Derencourt. This Merlot wine displays black fruit aromas and flavors. Some good grip on the back and excellent acid balance. Still a bit young but decanting will soften up for your steak dinner.  The nose opens after 30 minutes decanting and the palate impression is rich and round with some modern oak nuances.  Great for the cellar too.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This wine is rich, complex and a great value.  The nose is spicy, tart cherries and Chinese five spice, minus the star anise, dusty earth and a touch of sweet oak.  It is full bodied with medium tannins.  The fresh is brighter and fresher than on the nose and the earth takes on a fine mineral quality.  This wine calls out for lamb!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"What a wonderful vintage for Brane Cantenac.  At the UGC tasting in SF 1/2018 it was showing absolutely beautifully.  Wonderful purity and a top layer of dense wild fruits while offering a lot of smoky spicy notes underneath.  Incredibly balance and structure, this is delicious and a wine for the cellar.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Hints of coffee, spice and red currant fruit is followed by a rich, fleshy texture and velvety finish. This wine is juicy and spicy. Usually not one of my favorites out of barrel this is another winner from Margaux!

"Pioneers in the upper Yarra Valley, Oakridge Winey built an oasis of food and wine for the locals of Melbourne to enjoy a beautiful atmosphere paired with locally sourced food and wine (much like Napa is to San Francisco and Sacramento).  The balance they struck follows through in the wine we are able to enjoy from them stateside.  The “Over the Shoulder” wines are pleasant, well structured wines focused first on the quality of the fruit harvested from the cool ridges of Yarra.  This Cab-Merlot blend is expressive right away with blackberry pie and muddled wild raspberries in the glass and is complemented by cypress and bay forest notes.  On the palate the berry tones are partnered with cassis and mulberry.  The soft tannins give a structural platform for smoky bramble and the piney herbs you found on the nose drifting into a persistent finish.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Make some room in your cellar for this spectacular Rutherford blend.  Premium Napa blends are made for aging, and this one will do so beautifully.  At this early stage in its long life, you will taste powerful, fresh black fruit and violets, minerally graphite, peppers and anise with just a hint of menthol.  The tannins are perfectly extracted to be powerful but silky as they drift across the palate, and the acid balances and heightens all the flavors on the back end.  Truly a wine that matches the stunning aesthetics of the winery itself…which is impressive.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"I tasted this wine during a vertical tasting of 2011-2014. This wine is simply beautiful. These are elegant, classic structure and complex wines. The only thing I can add to the 2014 vintage is that the fruit is more pronounced but the still contained.  Fans of Quintessa will not want to miss out on this one. Superb!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The folks at Quintessa have been on quite a roll lately. For the last few vintages their iconic Cabernet bottling has been one of the best in the valley and after a recent visit I better understand why. Not only do they have a tremendous estate in Rutherford that they farm organically but they spare no expense and are dedicated down to the smallest detail to make the best wine they possibly can year after year. Aged in 80% new French oak this wine is labeled as Cabernet but also has small amounts of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Carmenere in the final blend and to me it speaks more of the great Left Bank Bordeaux of the last two decades than of the sometimes excessive Napa Cabs over the same time frame. Bursting with floral intensity and with a underlying core of amaro, and black fruited concentration this vintage seems a bit more lifted and spiced aromatically than either the ’12 or ’13 vintages at this stage. “Pretty” was the word that I kept coming back to in my notes as this wine has a lithe and giving frame full of open, airy berry fruit, crushed flowers, a subtle meaty spice and layered plum and cassis tones. This was like breath of fresh air not only for Napa Cab but also for the warm 2014 vintage for me as the vigor and energy of this wine is going to be hard to beat. I wouldn’t doubt this wine would be great in 20 years but it is also darn good right now too!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Quintessa's 2014 portfolio is unquestionably the best set of wines they have ever released.  Perhaps it's their rock-star winemaker, Rebekah Wineburg (tremendous name too, I know) they have employed, or the amazing vineyards they have, or the state of the art winery they built, or the culmination of all of these factors.  Frankly, I don't know.  What I do know is their proprietary red blend is an absolute knock-out.  Medium to full bodied, dark fruited, complex, ethereal - it's got it all.  Drink it this evening or cellar it for twenty years.  This is one of the most versatile wines I've ever had the pleasure to taste.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Modern style, but well-balanced. Great crossover wine for California Cabernet. Spicy, Blackberry flavors.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The 2nd wine of Pape-Clement is warm, approachable and already showing good complexity.  Ripe red fruits, surprising mid-palate roundness and a gravely finish show the pedigree of this great property.  Delicious now.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"And yet another example of fantastic second wines from a fantastic  a vintage. No doubt Le Clementin delivers an impressive wine, and also maintain its classic Pessac-Leognan style. Cocoa powder, plums and cassis jam and wet stone and a great tannin/acid structure framing it, and balancing this elegant wine.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"For the lover of well-balanced, smoky cabs, this value from Washington had much more going for it than I had anticipated. The strawberry aromas are balanced by stewed black cherry and a dry woodiness. The palate shows plums, cocoa, and baking spices accompanied by a lingering finish. Grab two bottles: one while you cook the roast beef and the second to pair.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Seven Hills has delivered a wine that packs way more punch than it's $20 price tag. Expressive aromas of black berry fruit and oak spices hint at the power of this vintage. Black currant and fresh raspberry fruits, black tea, graphite follow, with a lovely acidity and healthy dose of tanin to wrap up the entire package. This 2013 Cabernet should easily last a decade!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Densely centered on the nose and filled with India ink, charred beef, brooding blackberry fruit and warm spiced oak aromas, this is a rarely found in a wine of this price point. Full bodied with pretty olive, laurel and tarragon flavors on the entry, this has fanned out with sometime in the bottle and has a nice lushness and fruit concentration. Powerful with plenty of hallmark Columbia Valley extraction and sheer fruit power this builds on its typically tannic frame and adds layers of Mexican chocolate and mocha on the packed and young finish. As I tasted this all I could think about is how much more expensive it would be if it came from Napa Valley. Thanks Washington!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This 2013 Cab from Seven Hills is a big, rich red that that’s a killer value and shouldn’t be missed! Expressive notes of pomegranate, raspberry, ripe plum, cinnamon and coffee show on the nose and have underlying earth and herbal notes. The finish is long and lingering with big tannin and balanced well with oak.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Last years vintage of this was one of my favorite go to wines for people looking for serious cab that was not going to cost them $50-$100. Having just tasted the new vintage I can continue to strongly recommend them to anyone seeking good Cabernet. The 2013 vintage is a big, structured vintage with good fruit and chewy tannins. Although this wine is drinking well now, this is one that will age exceptionally well, or needs some decanting time. Drinking a cab with this much length and structure it is almost a shock when I remember that it is $20.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is a stellar deal! This Cabernet Sauvignon embodies the terrior and wine making style of Columbia Valley. The nose is loaded with dark berries, pomegranate, and fresh white flowers. Big opulent fruit and powerful earthy tannin makes this perfect for any Cabernet lover. Soft integrated cedar notes help lift the dark fruit and add to this complex wine. For a $20 wine, there is a lot going on in the glass, a real bargain.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Almost 20 years old and going strong. It has shed its tannic cloak and the red fruit is emerging nicely.Actually a sweet core of fruit and some toasty oak. Decant and enjoy with a new York steak.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is almost ethereal in texture and despite the power and richness present, grace and balance are the hallmarks.  The mid-palate is deep but clean and the dark fruit, Asian spice and touch of clay that poke through are finely tuned and perfectly integrated.  The long, saline finish hides plenty of ripe tannin but glides smoothly and effortlessly.  This was very easy to taste.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"2016 Cos d'Estournel is a great wine! Loaded with exotic black fruits, powerful but in perfect focus. Lovely middle fruit texture and style, super long finishing wine. Better than Mouton and Lafite! 3 Star Wine and candidate for wine of the vintage.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"I have wonderful memories of the great vintages of Cos d’Estournel from the 1980’s. These were some of the wines that shaped my earliest impressions of Bordeaux. Yet, sadly, I feel as though sometime in the past decade or so we sort of lost touch with each other. I remember tasting the 2009 and finding it much riper than I expected, much bigger and grander in style. I thought, well, things change. I silently wished the property well and thought, at least I still have my memories of a shared past, a simpler time. Imagine my joy, then upon tasting the 2016 vintage en primeur. Mon vieux! The unique conditions in 2016 yielded a wine that will rival the great vintages of decades past. This is a wine heavily dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon, which makes up 76% of the blend. It is a miracle of the dry conditions and the very warm days and cool nights of July and August. The wine is deeply colored and intensely aromatic with great presence and persistence. A marvel of perfect ripeness, lively acidity, and very fine tannins, and all with a mere 13% alcohol. Structured, yet refined. Exquisitely balanced. A more definitive expression of terroir I have rarely seen. Classic. A triumph.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This wine is off-the charts great.  13.07 degrees Alcohol like the old days of great Bordeaux wines. Incredible, intense, spicy aromas with cinnamon undertones on the palate. So silky and precise-pure as can be. Long and lovely-so good you can drink it soon, but it will cellar well for many years. Bravo on the reasonable price.  A very special wine and one of the top ten I tasted in April.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"2016 is a blend of 60% Cab, 35% Merlot, 4% Petit Verdot and 1% Cab Franc. If you have bought older Lanessans from the late '90s from us, it's a whole new world here now. Talented winemaker Paz Espejo has lowered yields, stiffened up the selection of fruit and tossed the old wood. The wine is now loaded with deep, dark, sweet fruit! But the soil is the same so it retains its powerful finish. A lot of wine here for $14.99 and will age well. 1 star.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"No store in the USA sells more lanessan than K&L.  This 2016 was tasted three times by our staff in early April.  60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 100% delightful.  So aromatic like many of the 16s-tons of fruit covers the abundant tannin (ala 2009 but this one is much better).  Paz Espejo has found her niche at Lanessan and this is the best she has made there.  Tons of red fruit flavors linger on the palate.  Lovely, smooth, tastes great now.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The arrival of director Paz Espejo in 2009 represented a radical change for Chateau Lanessan. The retirement of Hubert Bouteiller ended eight generations of direct management of the property by the Bouteiller family, who have owned the chateau since the 18th century. Updates to the packaging and labeling of the bottles, as well as technical changes in the vineyard and cellars have brought a cleaner, more modern look, feel, and flavor to the wines. The 2016 vintage does not lack for fruit – there is ample ripeness here – but there is also a more savory, cigar box element that is reminiscent of the many older vintages our customers have enjoyed over the years. This wine will no doubt please all fans of Chateau Lanessan – both old and new.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Lanessan is a perennial super-star at K&L, and the 2016 vintage is no exception. For me Lanessan always achieves a harmonious balance of fruit and savor. Aromas of cedar, spice and antique wood lie beneath a lovely core of pure dark fruit. Freshness and balance on the back end make this another great effort from one of our favorite Chateaux.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Tasted from barrel the first week of April.  This is big and rich with a wonderful dry finish that accents the firm tannins.  This is an affordable Old School Bordeaux that packs a punch and over delivers.

"The 2007 Teresa Raiz Decano Rosso is a blend of 60% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc, the grapes were grown on Friuil’s classic soils a mix of glacial morainic and rocky flat. The grapes were harvested the first part of October, fermented in stainless steel and then aged in French Allier barrique for 14 months. At 10 years old the wine’s age has allowed it to soften and have the flavors evolved into a complex blend of earth, fruit and spice, owner/winemaker Paolo Tosolini suggests you try it with braised meat dishes.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"With 95% Cabernet Sauvignon, 2% Cabernet Franc, 2% Merlot and 1% Petit Verdot, this is the flagship red blend. The aromatics of black raspberries, cocoa powder and chai tea are so inviting. This is a powerful wine, but the firm structure is holding it in for now. It has substantial acidity and dry, leathery tannins. This should age well.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Poujeaux needs twenty years to drink the way that I like it, and this is in a perfect spot, not showing any sort of fragility. We tasted this blind, and I was over the moon for the quality and finesse of this now mature claret.

"One of our favorite margaux wines. Jean Luc Zuger is fashioning some of the best values in all of Bordeaux.  Do not miss his 2015 and 2016 vintages.  2004 was a classic Bordeaux vintage-we love the wines as they are always well-priced between the famous 2003 and 2005 vintages. Our good friend James Suckling scores it 92.

By far, one of the more impressive Beychevelle offerings in recent memory

"The 2014 Montrose is refined, classy and substantial with balanced structure and a depth of fruit.  This is one of the best Left Bank wines of the vintage and is just beginning to reveal the complexity of red and black fruits embedded in the taut and poised body.  The gloriously warm Indian summer and ideal harvest conditions are evident in every sip of this sophisticated powerhouse.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"One of the best wines of this underrated vintage. It is classic, racy, and noble—so much elegance, finesse, balance and equilibrium. Deep purple color is followed by a sweet nose of black cherries, minerals and black currants. Delicious now on the palate, but cellar it 5-10 more years.

"Surrounded by the likes of Latour, Pichon-Longueville and Lynch-Bages, Bellegrave could not have asked for a more prestigious neighborhood! Its gravely soils are textbook-perfect for Cabernet Sauvignon, and also give the château its name. The wine is medium-bodied, with plum fruit and an intriguing citrus note. Showing the lighter side of the vintage, its fruit will need more time to flesh out and put on a bit of weight. A few more years in the cellar will do just that.

"The 2014 Spottswoode Estate Cab is a Napa Valley cab that will stand the test of time. This Cab is powerful and concentrated, full of blackcurrant and plum, baking spice and graphite.

The firm acid structure is a true indicator of long-lived this wine will be!

"Langoa has made a fabulous wine for the cellar here, but you'll have to bury it at the bottom of a big stack... It tastes a little too good to hold onto right now! This great 2014 has an explosive nose of red fruit with bonbon ceris and extraordinary purity on the palate. The length is striking, as is the focussed acidity. This will prove to be one of the great Langoa's in time, if we can keep our hands off of it!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Ah... fresh, classic Cabernet Sauvignon! The fruit is from a single vineyard of 40 year old vines and aging is in neutral French oak barrels. The aromas of flowers, herbs and spice will pull you in and the purity of fruit, structure, balance and refined personality will hook you. This is a genuine wine.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"What a great start to the tasting. The best we have ever tasted for sure. So aromatic, voluptuous wine with black raspberry aromas and flavors.  So sweet and lovely you want to drink it immediately.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"At the Moueix tasting April 6th this super affordable wine went up against the big guns from this portfolio and absolutely held its own.  This is sweet, fruity and oh so smooth with raspberry and cherry flavor in spades.  The dark and creamy middle has wonderful freshness and the finish has the perfect amount of grip.  This is one of the great values of the appellation.

"My top Right Bank value in 2016 has to be Château Puy-Blanquet. I have always enjoyed this château's wines, but the 2016 is operating on a whole new level. Deep dark color with notes of cherry, vanilla, bay leaf and black olive fill the glass. The palate is decadent, sweet and round with supple tannins and mouth-watering acidity. This is by far the best Puy Blanquet I have ever tasted!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"A wonderful wine from the great 2015 vintage. It has a nice developed nose that offers inviting aromatics. In the mouth it is classic Bordeaux with dry dark fruit flavors enhanced with a touch of earth. It is complex and very enjoyable. This wine was tasted after it had been decanted for two hours.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"**Don’t Miss** Displays all the beautiful fruit, finesse, perfume, and fine grained tannins of the best 2015 Margaux.  Rich fruited and lifted with seamless texture and a long finish.  Rauzan Segla shines in 2015.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Another winner from the Margaux appellation - The Rauzan-Segla is polished and concentrated with hints of cola, cassis and red cherries that linger on the finish. Lots of layers here – excellent focus and polish here!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Possibly one of the wines of the vintage the 2015 Haut Bailly is a showstopper. For under $100 this wine is one of the 2015 Bordeaux's you need to snatch up. Rich, full-bodied and with great delineation this wine has pure red fruit, spice notes as well as hints of red cinnamon and stone. The finish is long and smooth with fruit and mineral notes slowly fading into the ether.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The 2015 Haut Bailly was another serious stunner from a property whose star seems to shine brighter each vintage. The minerality of Pessac Leognan was wholly perceptible underneath gorgeously lush fruit and fine tannins that cloaked the wine with elegance and finesse. Finesse is a word you'll hear a lot when describing 2015 Bordeaux because the wines are so pretty. It applies entirely and perhaps most applicably to the Haut Bailly.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"**One of the wines of the vintage** Black cherry and dark fruits, spice, anise, and mineral.  The purity of this wine is amazing.  Elegant, deep, and lifted with fine acidity and lovely aromatics.  Intense and complex with old vine character. The Grand Vin includes fruit from four hectares of old vines, some of which are over a hundred years old.  A truly inspired Claret.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Haut Bailly- Classic claret! Strong dark fruit with great drive, followed by great freshness and elegance without a hint of over ripeness.  2 Stars! Ralph Sands
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Another one of the top wines from the vintage, this is an elegant, sweet and fleshy Haut Bailly. It is loaded with a wonderful core of red fruits which is complemented with hints of minerals, cedar and graphite. It is well structure and balanced and should be a good candidate for cellaring.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Ripe and sweet entry.  This wine supervised by the Beychevelle team is sweet and easy to drink.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This wine absolutely knocked our socks off when we tasted at the château. It's not just about the seamless fruit or sensual texture at Haut-Brion, it's the mineral notes, the smoke, the hint of black olive. It's a symphony of complexity.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Only 39% of the harvest was used in the grand vin and includes 40-100 year old-vine Merlot grown on gravel soils.  Cos d’Estournel has one of the most privileged terroirs of St-Estèphe on the southern slopes of the hill of Cos.  They also use all gravity flow throughout the winemaking facilities.  Dark and spicy with currant, black fruits and graphite.  Firm but rich fruited and dense from the old vines.

"Fruity and rich for a young Pauillac but well developed and delicious to drink now.  This is the 2nd wine of a property to watch closely.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This lovely Pauillac from one of our favorite value properties in the communie shows pretty mixed berry fruits and a rather sumptuous, supple quality which belies the more typically classic and restrained quality of the 2014 vintage. That said, this precocious Pauillac is delicious now and should continue to drink well for a decade.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Pauillac. The heart of the Médoc. Home to no fewer than three of the five First Growths. In addition, there are an even dozen Fifth Growths, most famously Lynch Bages and Pontet Canet. The list also includes Chateau Pédesclaux, itself one of the few remaining bargains in Pauillac. If you are looking for genuine value though, and prefer to drink your wines sooner rather than later, consider their second label Fleur de Pédesclaux. The 2014 is a marvel, redolent of oak spice and replete with generous dark fruit. With the bulk of the estate’s Cabernet Sauvignon reserved for the Grand Vin, this second label relies on Merlot for the majority of the blend, yielding a wine that is intentionally softer in style and more immediately accessible.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Tasted on our April 2017 Bordeaux trip. Spicy, peppery nose and flavors.  A bit modern, but solid and extremely well-balanced. The second wine of Pedesclaux, and this property is really making outstanding wines.  The north Medoc wines in 2014 are outstanding.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The 1989 Chateau Grand-Puy-Lacoste has a reputation for superb quality, so in typical K&L fashion we went right after the property's second wine: the Lacoste Borie. Named for the Borie family, of Ducru Beaucaillou fame as well, the second wine lives up to the hype of the vintage. Still showing fruit after almost three decades, the tannins are soft, integrated, and the palate is like pure silk. Those looking for underrated value from Bordeaux should take note.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The Second wine of Chateau Clinet is deep. slick and dark with a slightly savory edge to the plum and black current fruit.  This is an approachable classically styled Pomerol for not much money.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The second wine of the famous Clinet property is quite rare. We tasted it and loved it in the  April 2017 Bordeaux trip. Quite plummy aromas and still elegant on the palate. Superb balance and lingering finish. try it.

"Named for the Linden trees that famously marked the St Helena property before it became the Spottswoode Estate, the ""Lyndenhurst"" Cabernet is rich, supple and complex. Made with both Estate, Oak Knoll, Oakville and Knights Valley fruit, the wine has depth and power, but with subtle herbaceous and floral aromatics threaded together by a persistent yet balanced acidity. The ""Lyndenhurst"" tannins are soft enough to complement tonight's meal, but this wine is definitely worthy of aging.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"My favorite Cabernet Sauvignon’s in the store, for both taste and value. This wine comes from our friends at Amici, a winery based in the Napa Valley. It’s primarily Cabernet Sauvignon (89%), with smaller amounts of Cabernet Franc, Malbec, and Petit Verdot blended in. The wine exudes aromas of deep plum, black currant, blueberry, and blackberry. Bouquet of espresso, dark chocolate, and lavender. On the palate, dark fruit flavors of cassis and blackberry come forward once more, with additional flavors of mocha and vanilla. A noted savory quality to this wine as well. Great balance of richness to acidity; tannin structure is silky in texture. Drinking really well now, but will as with others, 2013 is widely regarded as one of the best vintages on record for Napa Valley winemaking. Can easily cellar for another 10 years. One of our best Cabernet Sauvignons in store for under $75
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is among the last Napa Cab blends we have from the great 2013 vintage and perhaps the best deal for a sub-$50 Napa we have in stock. This is exactly the type of wine that makes people want to drink Napa Cab. Rich and full bodied the wine opens with plum, cassis, and red berry notes. Interplaying with the ripe fruit are notes of sandalwood, coffee and chocolate, adding savory depth to the wine. Well balanced with a firm structure and integrated tannins, this is a beautiful bottle for cool evenings and serious nights.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is real deal Cabernet.  What I love about this wine is that you absolutely get that beautiful Napa Valley Cabernet fruit but there is so much more going on with with.  There is a judicious amount of  oak, it rounds out and adds subtle chocolate and spice notes.  There is also a savory almost olive like note to it that plays incredibly off the fruit.  Full and rich this is a very satisfying Cabernet.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Amici Napa Cabernet has been a favorite for quite some time now. The 2013 vintage was superb for cabs in the area and it really shows in the bottling. Blackberry, blueberry, cassis, a touch of vanilla and oak spice. Drinking well now and will reward another 10 years in the cellar.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"A very complex wine from a great vintage! Enticing nose of leather, dried meat, dark fruit, cocoa and vanilla. Carrying on the palate the leather, olives, currants and cocoa. Medium+ tannins, and acidity. I would recommend decanting this beauty for about 1 hour before drinking.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Drink the 1997 now and cellar this one a few years.  From the Delon crew, this wine is polished and fruity.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is as good as a deal as you'll find in 2009. It's just incredible wine with subtlety and finesse, a solid core of sweet fruit, and lovely tannins that almost melt on the finish. Potensac has been overdelivering as a Chateau for the last decade. This is a case-worthy purchase.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Love this nose! Hints of cedar, spice, black cherry and licorice, this wine is polished and pure. The mid-palate fruit is round and full with a long spicy finish. This should be an excellent wine for the cellar but will be quite approachable upon release.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Dark berry fruit, hints of dried herbs and tobacco. Pretty berry fruit, pencil lead and volcanic stone lead into a balanced and layered wine. Best Lynch since 2010.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The 2015 Lynch Bages was the first wine we tasting on the morning of the third day in Bordeaux, so our palates were fresh and ready. The aromas were full of dark fruit and oak, the fruit was ripe on the palate with plenty of power as a counterweight. Behind that power was finesse on the finish; the iron fist in a velvet glove analogy we like to use so often. This is one of the more powerful wines I tasted from the 2015 vintage, easily capable of long-term maturation.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"A big and powerful wine with cranberry and cassis aromas and the lead pencil is there also. This wine is 70%CS, 24%M, and a bit of PV and CF. This wine will need some ageing as it has a lot of fruit, acid, and tannin. Priced correctly, it will be a bargain of 2015.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Shows dried cherry, floral notes, cedar, peppery spice and red currant fruit. It has fleshed out since we last tried it in 2009, but there is still plenty of structure, with finer tannins and bright acidity.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"At our last staff tasting, the 06 Domaine de Chevalier Rouge was really singing after having been open the better half of the day.  The nose was all classic Pessac leather, graphite, and black fruit aromas, leading to a medium-bodied palate framed by fine-grain tannins and a tannic, grippy finish. This wine is undoubtably young, but you will thank us when you check back in on this wine after laying it away for another 5, and then another 10 after that. It is just going to get better.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Here is another example of a fantastic 09 Bordeaux at $50 and under. This a layered wine with fragrant spices, graphite, cassis and blackberry on the nose. Ripe cassis and black fruit on the palate along with an underlying minerality, spice and a bit of earthy and garrigue notes. This is still Sociando in style with big astringent tannins built for the long hall.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Anyone looking for a bargain 2009 Bordeaux to cellar up to 2 decades should check this baby out.  This husky, hearty wine starts with compelling aromas of ripe blackberries, dark,sweet plums and wet minerals.  The middle is powerful and dense with a roasted fig meatiness and plenty of deep, dark fruit qwhich blends into a finish of cold steel.  There is no grip to the rounded, fine and ripe tannins which are beautifully embedded in the copius fruit.  Decant this for several hours tonight or cellar for retirement.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"**+  More flamboyant and forward then the Las Cases and nearly as precise with a rich, creamy texture of sweet fruit and a fresh, fine finish.  An almost exotic Saint-Julien with depth, structure and fruit to spare all encased in an aura of nuance.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"One of our favorites and I have at least twn vintages in my cellar.  Superb minerality in this wine which is very precise and focused. So fresh and lively. Layers of ripe fruit and some latent tannin underneath.  Lovely and usually priced correctly. They suffered a lot from the April 2017 frost.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is clean and racy with a dark core of blackberry fruit, iron and cocoa.  There is a hard candy punch to the sweet and primary fruit flavors before the intensity of the  super mineral finish takes over.  This is classic, steely and easily of  2nd Growth quality.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Another fav for K&L and me especially.  From a property quite near our Golf du Medoc Bordeaux home, this property was taken over in the mid-2000s and completely renovated.  Their 2009 was stunning and we sold over 2,000 bottles, and we are still selling it for $20. This beauty is $15-a steal for your cellar.

"Here we have the power of Chateau Montrose but at a more approachable price.  Scents and flavors of bright Bing cherries,  earth, leather , sweet dark fruits and flowers expand as this takes on air.  The finish is long and fresh in this wine of impeccable pedigree.  Decanting for at least an hour is highly recommended.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Save your 2014 Montrose and drink this ""baby Montrose."" 60% Merlot from a great value north Medoc vintage. Tobacco and coffee aromas. Plenty of minerality on the palate. I just love this wine. No hard edges.  The 3rd wine of Montrose.

"Showing absolutely beautifully right now, lots of elegance and poise. It is approachable and yet could be put in the cellars for a while.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Since the ""Dame"" is the official second label of Montrose, I guess that makes ""Le St. Estephe"" the the third wine, but pound for pound I think it's right there with the great lady. Considering most properties generally use their youngest vines for their second and third label expressions, you can really see just how much effort Montrose put into revitalizing their vineyards with this release. The ""Le St. Estephe"" is a gorgeous and precise claret, one that seamlessly weaves delicate fruit, dry earth, and soft tannins into a medium-bodied, old school style. Far from a fruit bomb, the wine never lacks ripeness or roundness, but it's beautifully integrated into the other elements here. 2014 is not only a great vintage for the grand vin, it's a great vintage to demonstrate just how deep the quality runs at Montrose today since the new owners took over in 2006.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Neil Martin: There is a floral note that emerges with time. The palate is medium-bodied with very fine tannins. There is a real backbone to this Pessac-Leognan, although the structured is disguised behind layers of velvety tannins. Gorgeous – but it deserves several years in the cellar. I totally agree with Neal on this one-these guys make great wine every year. This is stunning.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Tasted the first week of April.  This has inviting aromas of flowers and oak that lead to a deep and sweet middle of crushed dark fruit.  The richness is tempered by the long finish of fine tannin which lends a sense elegance to this fruity wine.  This vintage of Beaumont is packed.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"A no-brainer.  Beaumont makes elegant, soft style wines and has for many years. This one is lovely and worthy of your cellar.  A superb value with plenty of elegance and flair.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Beaumont seems to shine in every vintage, but I found the 2016 to be particularly exciting! Notes of dark fruit and fig cake lead to an enticing palate of soft pure fruit. This wine is medium bodied with fine supple tannins and a crisp finish. A standout in the value category - not to be missed.

"From 113 hectares of vineyards on gravel soils in Cussac-Fort Médoc, just south of Saint Julien-Beychevelle, planted to 53% Cabernet Sauvignon, 42% Merlot, and 5% Petit Verdot. The 2016 Beaumont, Haut-Médoc displays an admirable ripeness of fruit, but one balanced by lively acidity and fine tannins. Very true to the vintage, very fresh, very precise. Ample proof that the quality in 2016 runs from top to bottom.

"This tiny viticultural enclave, consisting of a mere 5 hectares of vineyards, lies fully within the city of Bordeaux, immediately north of its more famous neighbor, Chateau Haut-Brion. The property takes its name from the order of Carmelite nuns who held it for more than two hundred years, from the late 16th century to the time of the French Revolution. With its 19th century chateau and sculptured gardens, there is still a sense of the cloister about the place, a remarkably peaceful oasis in the heart of a bustling metropolis. The holy sisters would likely be greatly startled however by the new Philippe Starck designed winery, which rises like a leviathan from the spring fed stream that bisects the property. The new cellars and winemaking facility are part of a comprehensive program of investment initiated by new owner Patrice Pichet since acquiring the property in 2010. The 2016 Les Carmes Haut Brion is a vindication of his efforts to realize the full potential here. It is a breathtaking expression of the unique terroir of the northern Graves, at once intensely mineral and extraordinarily concentrated. The blend includes an astonishing 41% Cabernet Franc, supported by 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 39% Merlot. Perfectly ripe, with lively acidity and firm, fine tannins. Deeply colored and very aromatic, with a savory/spicy character, very much in keeping with the vintage. A superb effort, not to be missed. This is a property to keep an eye on. Great things are happening here.

"Actor Kyle MacLachlan and Dunham Cellars have come together to create this Pursued by Bear label with fruit sourced from 3 vineyards in Columbia Valley. This is a small production project of just 367 cases and we were lucky enough to grab a few. 100% French oak aging for over 2 years from a single cooper gives this Cabernet focus and finesse. It is bold and rustic with great structure that will provide longevity in the cellar. Dark flavors and aromas of blackberry, cassis, black cherry and chocolate along with dried leaf and earthy character really shine.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Ripe, rich and lush fruit dominate the senses with this wine! There are some firm tannins on the finish and the wine does have structure but overall the flavors of black licorice and red cherries dominates the palate. One of the best wines I have tasted from this property.

"Giscours- 60% CS 32M 5CF 3PV The two estates under the direction of Alexander Van Beek continue to improve and have really hit the sweet spot in 2015. Giscours is one of the strongest wines in terms of power and aging potential while still keeping its Margaux elegance. The strong, sweet, and deep masculine fruit is pretty flashy and has nice plush middle fruit texture that is not always present in this wine.  Serious wine, along the same lines as Ch.

"Coleraine is the answer to the request, ""I want a New World wine"" (that is implied because this request occurs while standing in the Domestic Cabernet section) with richness and fruit but with restraint and complexity (they are looking at the Bordeaux section).  This wine has it all.  It is a great wine.  Never mind that it is priced at the entry level for high-end wine from both of those regions.  Hawkes Bay is the great Cabernet family terroir that most people do not know.  They should, especially if they Cabernet based wines from K&L. This will not disappoint, in fact, it will encourage more excursions to this often-overlooked region.

"They say things come in threes...well the 2013 and 2014 Coleraine both received perfect 100 point scores. The 2015 release now seeks to complete the trio and is definitely flirting with perfection once again. The wine has only been reviewed by a limited number of critics and has already racked up two 98 point scores and two 96s. Chatting with GM / Owner Nick Buck I couldn't resist asking him what was his preference among this trio of back-to-back-to-back magic vintages...he would only answer that many writers, Somms and wine industry folks had raved about the new 2015 release and commented that it probably has more immediate appeal than the two prior vintages. I thought the wine was a classic Coleraine delivering all of what I have come to expect from this iconic release. But in this vintage it seems to have an intensely inky color and a particularly concentrated mid-palate.  There is deep, plummy, blackcurrant fruit here but there is also plenty of fine grained, powdery tannins that will assure a long life. The 2015 Coleraine can undoubtedly stand shoulder to shoulder with the best vintages of this prestigious wine and really only time will tell which vintage comes out on top.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Te Mata is one of those producers that just consistently blows me away, really across the board with their wines. I love the Awatea, I drank more bottles of their Gamay/Pinot than I will admit too, and their Sav Blanc is spectacular. That being said the Coleraine is in another league. I am hard pressed to think of another wine that can give you the richness and body of California with the elegance, structure, and length of France. Moreover it is just straight up silly good, you can drink this wine now, keep it around for many years, surprise people with an insanely good bottle or just hoard it all for yourself.

Very well made and ready for a few years in the cellar.

It is so good you wouldn't mind getting run over by a mini van after tasting it.

"One of my favorite wines of the vintage--period. This wine was supple and rich on the palate with seductive fruit and a finish that just went on forever.

"The 2013 Amici “Reserve” Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon ($79.99) is a perfect example of why we have longtouted the wines of this comparatively under-the-radar producer and its sister label, Olema (out of Sonoma), for years. Basically, everything they touch turns to gold, and does so for a discount. And gold, or in this case wine, at a discount is something we can all get behind. We’ve sold past vintages of this reserve wine in small quantities, but this vintage is going to be huge for us all the way through the end of the year. It easily outperforms about 95% of the Cab coming out of Napa at this price point, which is a boatload of wine. Powerful but engaging, ripe but balanced, fruity but well sculpted, this wine has amazingcomplexity and tension that will serve it well over the next 6–12 years. Boysenberry, sweet tobacco, dried lavender, black olives and a touch of tar all combine for a complete wine. This is fun enough to drink with your friends at a simple dinner at home, or serious enough totake to that power dinner you have with work bigwigs.

"With the weather in St. Estephe a bit rainy and wet compared to other Left Bank appellations, the cabernet-heavy 2015 Montrose doesn't show any signs of waterlog. This is easily the best Montrose I've tasted in my young career and the most lush on the palate. The black fruits are rich and mouthcoating, the structure firm and foreboding. An old school claret worthy of second-growth status.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"It is easy to understand the purity of fruit, focus, and great core here when you find out that Montrose conducted three passes through the sorting tables and then used an optical sorter.  Cassis, blueberry, deep black and blue fruits with graphite.  Medium plus bodied, silky, balanced, and pure.  Excellent.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is one of the more mineral, earthy, and powerful Poujeaux expressions I've ever tasted with balanced fruit that really provides the foundation for some of the wines terroir driven flavors. The finish is leaner with more gravel and earth. Good stuff for those looking for Bordeaux beyond simple fruit.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"For decades, I have been preaching the gospel of Poujeaux to anyone who would listen. I believe that these wines, given enough time in the cellar, will stand on the table with anything. This 1990 has been given that time in the cool cellars of one of our negociant partners in Bordeaux, and is not drinking absolutely beautifully. If you have been invited to a wine dinner where everyone else is bringing $200 bottles, you will not be out classed with this beauty from Moulis. It has integrated and gained complexity over the last 27 years, but still has excellent concentration and ripe Cabernet fruit. The finish is long, detailed and far more complex than many more expensive, famous bottles that I have had lately.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Wow... Famous name, famous vintage, and pure deliciousness make this bottle a knock-out. I'm typically not as much of an ""older wine"" (savory, leathery) kind of guy, but I thought this was an impressive wine. The aromas are mellow, yet alive and lifted, filled with plum, blackberries, mint, graphite, vanilla, bell pepper, and leather. The palate is just as well supported; the oak held up nicely and definitely help this bottle retain its drinkability. Dark fruit flavors, forest floor, and cassis round everything up to a nice and easy finish.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Here is a wine that is absolutely ready to drink. We all know how beautiful 1990 was, and it shows here. The fruit is very much present, along with its silky tannins in this medium body Bordeaux. Absolutely perfect choice for an elegant dinner.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Tasted at the property. This wine looks to be a cross between 1999 and 2004. Not a monster, but 91% cabernet sauvignon and 9% merlot. 16% press wine in blend...quite high. About normal yields here. This wine has earthy aromas and red fruits on the palate. Good weight on the palate and very smooth. Quite forward for Latour. Pure and not over-extracted. An elegant Latour! 11,000 cases.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Strong and crisp at front end. Elegant cranberry on palate. Spicy and fresh finish.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"At the property this wine had an earthy nose and good sweetness on the palate. A bit short at end, but overall quite tasty. Should be drinkable way before their 2004, 2005 and 2006. 81% cabernet sauvignon and 19% merlot.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is a real winner with an aromatic profile of plump, juicy fruit, a rich but supple texture and very sweet tannins.  There is real richness to the blueberry, blackberry and currant fruit and great tension from beginning to end on this plush and balanced bargain.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This property was making fabulous wines in the '80s and slipped in the '90s.  Now they are back and on top of their game.The Château Clinet 2014 is a blend of 90% Merlot, 9% Cabernet Sauvignon and 1% Cabernet Franc. A subtle wine with very pretty, ripe fruit character and chocolate nuances.  Really is delicious and among my faves for the Right Bank 2014s.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is clean, crisp and tightly wound with lots of ripe red fruit and iron minerality.  There is great depth and wonderful tension in this classy and balanced wine of great pedigree.

"I'll never forget the first time I tasted Faust. It was at The Martini House (a once landmark restaurant in St Helena) and it was part of their mid-week burger special; a glass of Faust Cab and a burger for $16. What was amazing wasn't the ridiculous bargain price but how superbly the Faust paired with their rich, fatty, unctous burger. One of the main principles of food pairing is to match styles; light with bright, earthy with savory; acidic with tart; and unctous with rich. And that was exactly what the Faust Cab brought to the table in order to go toe-to-toe with their monster burger. The 2014 hasn't changed much since, and this 2014 is intensely fragrant right off the bat. Deep aromatics of currant, plum and bitter chocolate waft immediately from the glass and prepare you for a palate brimming with luscious  blackberry and black cherry. The kicker at the end is the surprising acidity and structure that help keep this concentrated and full-body Cab able to pair with every occasion and robust meal you choose to throw at it!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is easily one of the best sub-fifty dollar values on the market right now – a wine that Robert Parker described as “deep, wonderfully fruited, rich and savory…” He later admitted after tasting Faust along with Quintessa that it was “probably the best set of wines [he had] yet tasted from the Huneeus family…” Frankly, it’s tough not to believe such a statement after tasting it and knowing that virtually all of the fruit comes from AVAs such as Rutherford, Coombsville, Atlas Peak, Mount Veeder or St. Helena – some of Napa’s most prized valley and mountain terroirs. It’s a beautifully layered, unctuous wine and an absolute steal for the money. In a climate where your entry level Napa Cab is hovering within the fifty dollar price point, you should take a hard look at Faust, as most wines in this category simply lack the acclaim and raw materials to compete with it.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Lots of dark cassis fruit on the nose and the palate, with some herb and mineral aromas. This wine was showing more chewy tannins than the other wines, with an astringent mouthfeel.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"One of the best wines of the vintage for me. Gorgeous aromatics, lush fruit, finesse and beauty through and through. A wine that holds up great vintages of the past.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"68% CS and 29%M. . Elegance personified. Black raspberry aromas with a mix of chocolate and earth. Dark fruit flavors, but much softer wine than its neighbor the Baron. This property is returning to its glory days of the 80s.  This one a bit like their amazing 1989.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Pichon Comtesse de Lalande- 68CS 29M 2CF 1PV…A far deeper expression here of attractive, elegant blackberry fruit, complex aromas of roses-violets, orange rind and citrus which is always a nice touch. The Comtesse is truly back on top of its game! 2 Stars Ralph Sands
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This one is not holding anything back; it is a full, rich wine with the aromatics showing off its cherry and cocoa notes. The palate reveals its fullness with chocolate, kirsch and underbrush notes. 90% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc. A steal at this price!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"It's always a struggle to find a well-balanced California Cabernet that is neither too lush and jammy with surprisingly high alcohol, nor too strict and structured, with a lack of California character, but that will still cost you less than $30. Well, here we have a solution! I tasted the Pied a Terre Cabernet from Sonoma the other day with some of my colleagues, and was immediately impressed with the flawless balance and fantastic depth of the wine, particularly given the price point. I have had beautifully structured, silky Cabernets of this caliber before from California, but the price tag usually contained at least 3 figures. This is a definite steal, and will be a go-to Cabernet for me in the future.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is an outstanding California cabernet for people like myself who love the dustier and mineral-driven flavors of French Bordeaux. The Pied a Terre is a cooler climate style of cabernet. It has structure and grit with flavors of graphite and pepper underneath the robust and dark-fruited core. There's plenty of fruit, it's just that it doesn't come at the expense of complexity. The price is the real kicker. It tastes a lot more expensive than $25. I could bring this to a steakhouse and really do some damage.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"I thought this wine was good in the 2012 vintage, but the '13 has me truly impressed. This is not an overly rich and flabby style cab, rather there is a dark and spicy nose with a touch of jalapeno. This leads to a rich body with bramble and cassis and a pleasant coat of tannic structure. A rare find for those who are looking for good value California Cabernet.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Here is another great Cabernet blend from Margaret River.  This has become one of my go to regions for Bordeaux varietal wines.  This wine is a charmer.  Rich fruit, supple tannins and enough acid to pull it all together, that is why I like this region so much!!!  There is a nice touch of oak and spice and well.  There are lots layers to this wine but is not a cork dork wine.  Pour yourself a big glass and enjoy!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This wine has quietly become a customer (and staff) favorite in recent years. Lovely aromatics of red and black fruits with notes of flowers and exotic spice. This graceful nose leads to as a dense palate of sweet and savory currant fruit with perfectly placed tannin. Excellent value!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Following the success of the wildly popular 2009, 2010, and 2012 vintages, this petit chateau is now firmly established as a staff and customer favorite. The vineyards are happily situated on a mix of clay limestone and gravel soils in Saint-Sauveur, just west of Pauillac near Chateau Bernadotte. The 2016 Peyrabon is a blend of about two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon to one-third Merlot, with the addition of a small percentage of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Cabernet is king on the Left Bank in 2016, and you can sense the quality of the vintage in the lively acidity and fine tannins found here. There is plenty of sweet fruit, too, but without excessive ripeness. The wine exhibits only moderate alcohol and retains great freshness. Superb!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"And the value wines from the left bank keep appearing at very reasonable prices---so far. This wine is about 63% Cabernet Sauvignon and is located very near Pauillac in the North Medoc.  We have never offered this wine on futures, but the 2016 is so good and we are selling many vintages of this wine over the last five years, I decided to offer it out. Spicy, very red berry dominated aromas that follow to the palate. So sweet and lovely and so reasonable in price at under $15.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Tasted the first week of April.  This has lively and lifted aromas of ripe red fruits that are an interesting counterpoint to the deep and rich middle.  The aromas are inviting and the middle fruit ripe and fresh but the tight finish of powerful tannins show this to be a serious wine and a great value.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Aromatic, uplifted, fragrant (maybe lavender), and fresh blue and blackberries start things off on the nose. Medium tannins, but with a generous helping of mineral-driven fruit and a bright sense of freshness on the palate. Impressive, intense and pure. This should hold up for a good long while!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"When ""wow"" is the first thing you write down upon tasting a wine, that is always a good sign. Deep and concentrated black and blue fruits show both on the nose and palate--plums in particular. Chocolate, mocha, tobacco and cedar offer a splendid combination of sweet and savory. The most notable things to me is the quality of the tannins. They are extremely fine and supple, especially for the vintage. A very impressive wine, and one of my favorite Napa 2014s so far.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The 2014 Eisele Vineyards ""Altagracia"" Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon is a seamless, seductive Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon. Fantastic aromas of chocolate covered cherries, cigar box and clove rise from the glass while the palate is a silky blend of baker’s chocolate, dark berry fruit, spice, mocha and subtle oak hints. Fine tannins and perfect balance help to round out this great Cabernet Sauvignon.

"A very successful vintage for Clerc Milon, this 2016 simply exudes class and character. Classic Pauillac, with great presence and weight. Ripe, sweet fruit. Very lively and fresh. Lush in texture with very fine tannins. A supremely polished effort. Superb. Tasted three times during en primeur week with consistent notes.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This Clerc is a powerhouse of a wine as opposed to the feminine style of Armailhac.  Tightly wound and ready for some serious cellaring.  20% less production here and some 2017 frost damage.  Should be great in 5-10 years.

"You will find a little bit of Tuscany in this glass that is ripe and fleshy with cocoa, spice, black fruit and density, full-bodied and broad on the palate with complex layers of earth and some soft tannin on the finish. This is a wine that is very user friendly now and has the aging potential over the next few years. This is the ideal match for red meats and roasted poultry or just a BIG glass all by itself after a long day from work.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The nose of this wine says depth, structure, not verbiage I normally include for the nose, but in this case you can really smell the power. The aromatics are an array of cocoa powder, black currant, wild cherry hints of tobacco and leather. On the palate the wine shows depth and concentration but never heavy, you can sense this is a wine made in barrique there is that slight torque one gets from small barrels yet they barrique doesn’t flavor the wine. The flavors are still, dark cocoa powder, cassis, blackberry with hints of leather and bits of heather and truffle. The finish is long, focused and tense, this is a wine that will benefit greatly from a longer aging but even in just 6 months to a year it will blossom tremendously.  Complex, powerful Bordeaux styled Super Tuscan that shows the Panzano terroir.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The ""Giorgio"" 2012 is a step up from the excellent 2011 and it's so good in fact, that it took us by surprise. It's impeccably balanced with a velvety and luxurious mouthful of chocolaty black fruit and fine ingrained tannins. The depth of fruit, ample structure and overall integration make this an ideal cellar candidate. Otherwise, open and give it a good amount of aeration or decant. Ribeye time for sure.

"This is a wine that should make most winemakers in California and Bordeaux jealous. This is a wine of richness and restraint.  A wine with immediate impact and subtlety.  It is extremely generous yet not completely forthcoming. It is a wine for tonight and a wine for the cellar.  It is the best of both worlds, Napa and the Medoc, it is just what we have come to expect from Margaret River and especially Moss Wood. A wine for all drinkers to pay attention to.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Margret River continues to build its status in and among the most famous Cabernet producing regions in the wine world, and it is easy to see why if we compare their geography with the big boys (Napa, Sonoma and Bordeaux): all on the west coast of a continent with a distinct oceanic influence, undulating terrain with depleted soils, and historically dry summers.  Margret River may have only passed its 50th birthday last year, but be sure we will continue to hear about the burgeoning rivalry for greatest Cab region well past their centennial.  The Mugford family has been key to that rising status of Margret River from their perch in the northern region of Wilyabrup (willy-ab-RUP) since 1979.  Situated perfectly on the Indian Ocean and benefiting from the gravel-strewn loamy soils, their property (and of course their efforts) perennially turns out world class Bordeaux varietals.  The 2014 “Wilyabrup” is composed of 92% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Cabernet Franc and 4% Petit Verdot.  The nose is an intense array of black cherry, blackberry, baking spice and a mintiness that leans toward a crushed eucalyptus seed dried in the sun; dusty, brambly and minty all in one.  Cassis and vanilla bean develop with time in the glass.  On the palate the fruit and spice elements persist as the tannins reveal structure that does not mask the flavor but embraces and prop it up.  Surprisingly balanced at its young age, there is no surprise why the critics are already swooning.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"I have written several reviews for Margaret River Cabernet because the quality from here for the price is so unbelievable. Moss Wood is one of the greats from this region and their Wilyabrup, the wine that put them on the map, shows why. Perfectly balanced aromatics of blackberry, cedar, vanilla, and cassis blend together on the nose. The wine shows a lush fruit mid-palate while maintaining grace and elegance through the finish. The tannin here is polished and integrated and blend together seamlessly.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Margaret River has recently been producing some of my favorite Cabs and this Moss Wood certainly gets on the list as on of my tops. It comes across as bright and fresh, with the quintessential woodsy Oz backdrop. It is more juicy than other Cabs of the region, but I find that to be a revelation and makes the wine so fun to drink now. This is phenomenally good Cabernet and Moss Wood has hit the top of my list as the new great producer.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"One of the bargains of the vintage and an amazing value.  This hearty wine has bold fruit and a chewy texture that deftly matches the richness to the strong tannins.  Perhaps a bit brash today but should mellow nicely by the time its released.  A "" must buy""  for all bargain hunters.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"For the low price you get a lot of wine here.  I love this wine and we tasted it three times.  Toasty, very fruity aromas of blackberry that follow to the palate.  So sweet and juicy on the palate you want to drink it now. Good acidity and very round tannins-this wine is NOT overdone like some of the past vintages. Bravo!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"From the stable of Bernard Magrez, owner of Pape Clement in Pessac-Leognan.

"The second great value made by the Labegorce team. This one is 62% Cabernet Sauvignon so it is much more masculine than the elegant Labegorce. Intense aromatics of rose pedals and cassis. Very concentrated on the palate, but still ripe and round texture.  The big tannins are hidden by all of the fruit. Big wine-ager. A steal at this low price.

"I sometimes wonder if the Barton-Sartorius family, owners of Langoa-Barton and Leoville-Barton, acquired Chateau Mauvesin in Moulis in 2011 as much for the quality of its stables as for its vineyards. Daughter Mélanie Barton-Sartorius is an avid equestrian in addition to being a trained oenologist. Whatever the reason, they have certainly spared no expense in developing the property. The old cellars have been restored and new capacity added; the vineyards have been expanded and replanted. Today they have 50 hectares of vineyards planted 45% to Merlot, 36% to Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% to Cabernet Franc, and 2% to Petit Verdot. The 2016 Mauvesin Barton is quite true to the vintage, very pretty with bright red fruits and a hint of spice. Merlot takes the lead here so a bit more ripeness is evident in the rich, textured mid-palate. The finish is understandably firm though quite fine. An admirable effort, very reasonably priced, and a suggestion of even better things to come.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Their best yet-I think so. So fresh and lively with a pronounced red fruit aroma.  Quite sweet palate entry and some tannins at the back. Fine structure for the cellar, but tempting now.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The folks at Leoville Barton are doing great things at this property.  There is a hard candy brightness to the crisp red fruited entry in this surprisingly forward gem.  The finish really tightens up with a firm tannic grip but overall there is more freshness than rusticity.  By the time this is released it should have mellowed into a beauty.

"A new property for Veronique Sanders and her team at Haut Bailly. Small production here and we sold all 20 cases we got in the 2015 vintage.  Not sure how much we get this year, but I like this vintage as much as the 2015. Sweet black cherry aromas-lovely texture on the palate. Very long on the finish. Surely a great value.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Although this has the depth, structure and balance to age many more years I really can't imagine it getting any better than it is right now.  This is fabulously complex with smoky, woodsy blackberry fruit, steeped tea, leather and cigar box aromas and a creamy texture that seems to accent the sweetness of the fruit.  The fine and subtle tannins on the graphite laced finish add tremendous length to this delicious wine.

"Velvety and rich, the 2011 Altagracia is surprisingly approachable. Though it packs plenty of muscle, the edges are refined and the texture is creamy with sweet tannins, for an extremely satisfying drink. Loads of red and dark berries greet the nose up front, wrapped in vanilla and mocha, finishing with some baking spice and comfortable acidity. While it's expressing itself very nicely right now, this is also a great candidate for your cellar, 10-15 years.

"The 2016 Haut-Brion, Pessac-Léognan would seem to be swimming against the current. In a vintage where most wines are dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon, it is instead Merlot (at 56% of the blend) that takes the lead here. Cabernet Sauvignon is the junior partner at 37.5% of the blend. Cabernet Franc makes up the remainder at 6.5%, though this grape did less well in 2016 and mostly went to the second labels. Very lively and fresh in keeping with the vintage. The tannins, too, here are quite firm. Overall this is reserved in style, quite powerful in its own way, but marked by restraint. Very fine indeed.

"This is the picture of grace yet with plenty of power behind the smoke, gravel, menthol and dark fruit that packs the mid-palate.  This seems brawnier than La Mission and exudes potential with the strength held in check by balance and equilibrium.

"A very classic 2014 Bordeaux with a relative lighter body, cassis, plums and a touch of coffee. It's old school as usual, and its structure tells me it will need time in the cellar.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is supple, rich and red fruited with scents of cedar, forest floor, mint and oak.  There is good weight and ripeness to the black cherry fruit in this elegant, gentle and round wine which finishes with a fresh walnut note.  This is tasty and already complex.

"""Beautiful, full + elegant. Great oak influence and balance."" These were the first thoughts I had and the start of copious notes upon tasting this wine for the first time. This Stags Leap District cab has incredible freshness and vibrancy. Lots of pretty purple flowers and deep dark fruits combined. The oak fits in with the fruit perfectly, never awkward or overpowering, but always contributing in proportion to the intensity of the grapes. The name of the game here is balance. Eminently enjoyable and well suited to food.

"Cliff Lede was established in 2002 and have been off to the races ever since. The 2014 Stags Leap District Cabernet Sauvignon exemplifies what the region is famous for. The wine has soft silky tannin, generous amounts of elegant fruit, and a long lingering finish. The acid is lifted, but perfectly integrated. On the nose, smoke, fresh savory herbs, a touch of cinnamon and dark fruits. The palate gets another treat with blackberries, and plum first present themselves,while hints of licorice and leather add intrigue. 9% Petit Verdot, 5% Cabernet Franc, 4% Malbec, and 2% Merlot were added to add texture and complexity.

"This is a truly impressive Cabernet! Full and soft, this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is super aromatic with layers of blackberry, black cherry, toasty oak, minerality and earth. The fruit is not too ripe and perfectly harmonious with the tannin structure on the back end. This is definitely a top pick for me around 50 bucks!

"I was really taken aback by both how approachable the 2014 Neyers was right out of the bottle and how it seemed to embody everything today's modern wine drinker is looking for with their California Cabernet: typicity, complexity, terroir, and deliciousness. The Neyers Conn Valley Ranch has Cabernet growing at elevations from as low as 400 feet up to 1200 feet, mostly south-facing so the grapes get a nice dose of consistent, but manageable sun. They've cut out a lot of their pesticide and fertilizers over the last decade and instead now use cover crops and a ring of pest-attracting plants outside the vineyard instead. The effect these changes have had on the quality of the wine is tremendous and you can taste all that fruit because there's a very judicious use of oak with the 2014. It's there in spirit, but the fruit still takes center stage. However, there's more than just fruit here. You get hints of earth, licorice, a bit of a dusty note from the tannins, and a nice variety of textures from front to back. At fifty bucks, the price is right and the wine tastes more expensive than some of the $100 options I've run across recently. In summary, it's a wine I'd be happy to give to just about anyone interested in a serious bottle of Napa Cabernet. It's all estate fruit and it speaks to a well-maintained vineyard site by Neyers.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Loaded with concentrated ripe fruit, the Neyer’s Cab is a full bodied wine that is not harsh or overly tannic. The tannins are hidden under the impressive amount of ripe fruit.  The texture is round and velvety with hints of minerals, cassis and blackberry. Surprisingly this wine shows very well, even at this early stage. Enjoy tonight!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Lovely and silky wine. Will drink well when released.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This wine seems to contradict everything I've experienced thus far from the 2007 Bordeaux vintage. It's expansive, palate coating, and supple with dark fruit and extreme elegance. It has all the textbook Clos du Marquis qualities, namely grace and subtlety. It's an overachieving wine from an underrated vintage that absolutely delivers for the price. Drink it now while you wait for the also underrated 2014 to age.

"We were fortunate to taste the 2016 Labegorce three times during our En Primeur trip, and the single adjective that stood out from each of my tasting notes was - “WOW!” It’s hard NOT to fall in love with this wine and the team at Chateau Labegorce. Tremendous passion, proficiency and enthusiasm translate to a wine that will not disappoint. Notes of Asian spice, flowers, bay, cedar and minerals leap from the glass, leading to supple and sweet palate impression. This wine displays great follow through, given its perfect balance of fine tannin and fresh acidity. Incredibly complex for the price, the 2016 Labegorce is sure to please.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"A perfect score from me considering the low price.  One of my top 5 from the Margaux region and that says a lot with the neighborhood that includes Palmer and Margaux. We had this wine three times and it was off the charts good every time. 52% Merlot which is high for the property. Such an intense nose of Asian spice and black cherry. Violets on the palate. Very feminine style-so precise.  SO DELICIOUS. A must buy-it will sell out quickly.  As good as it gets for any wine from anywhere for this price.

"*½+  72% Cabernet Sauvignon, 23% Merlot, 3% Cabernet Franc, 2% Merlot. From small Cabernet grapes and huge Merlot grapes, the resulting wine is quite big and tannic. Will be great.

"The Mount Peak Sentinel Cabernet is a wine to not overlook. Again, the fruit is mostly coming from Monte Rosso, a vineyard utilized by great Cabernet producers like Louis Martini, Arrowood, Bedrock and others. Bold and dark fruited with undeniable structure, you could give this a year or two in the cellar and I think you'll be very happy.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The fine and rather dusty tannins of the Mount Peak Cabernet should soften up rather quickly, giving short-term cellar fans something they can pop and pour before the end of the decade. Made primarily with fruit sourced from the Sentinel block of Monte Rosso vineyard, a shield-shaped section that marks the entrance to the property, the wine is dark and decadent, but never overtly oak or extracted. I think the big surprise of all three Mount Peak wines is how balanced they taste in the face of their huge alcohol levels. While I know most drinkers will gravitate to the highly-pointed red blend, the Cab is definitely the sleeper here. This could really open up down the line into something quite generous.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Steve Matthiasson takes a nuanced, light handed approach to this Napa Cabernet, which is blended from seven vineyards and three AVAs: Coombsville, Oak Knoll and Rutherford. His reason for combining fruit from these specific appellations is to highlight their distinctly unique fruit qualities, and let them shine without being weighed down by oak. As a result, this wine is incredibly complex, with bright, high tone aromatics of spiced raspberry and dried rosepetal, and a palate that is both light and clean, with a long, mineral laden finish.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The 2014 Spottswoode “Estate” Cabernet Sauvignon ($179.99) is a Napa Valley cab that will stand the test of time. This Cab is powerful and concentrated, full of blackcurrant and plum, baking spice and graphite. What lets me know how beautifully this wine will age is the ever-present silky tannins alongside a bright, youthful freshness. The firm acid structure is a true indicator of long-lived this wine will be!

"Chateau St. Jean. Surely a classic name in California wine but not necessarily one that elicits oohs and ahhs from the wine intelligentsia over the last decade. That being known to me when I tasted the 2012 Alexander Valley Cabernet, I’d have to say that I was completely, shocked, blown away, floored and whatever other preferred adjectives you want to insert here, by the wine. In fact, I’d say it is in my top 5 values of the year regardless of place or varietal. Yes it is that good. Leather and cedar intermingle on the nose leading to a warm-hued and familiar fruit and spice mélange that is about as textbooks as it gets for Cabernet: cassis, black olive, sandalwood, tobacco, leather, bay leaf and black tea. This wine certainly has plenty of fruit, oak, texture and tannin, but where it really shines is how all those pieces perfectly mesh together. “Harmonious” is the word I used in my notes to summarize this wine originally, and tasting it again recently I really couldn’t think of a better descriptor for it. Perfectly drinkable now, this has a firmness of tannin and a wealth of fruit that should keep it vital for the next 6-12 years.

"This is a great California Cabernet, wonderful layers, rich and ripe dark fruit very luscious and silky finish. Pull the cork and you are good to go! Two Thumbs up !!

",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"In the last big Bordeaux tasting, this was my favorite wine. It is also the consensus of K&L’s Bordeaux buyers that this is probably the best wine Cantenac has ever made, both heady and elegant at the same time. Coffee, black raspberry, cassis, vanilla and licorice on the nose. The palate is very elegant and seamless, with the rich fruit taking center stage, balanced by licorice and coffee along with rocky minerality and cedar, all of which carry on through the long, lingering finish. Damn, I really love this wine.

"This 1989 is still very dark and young, and I am glad that we gave it an hour and a half to air in the decanter. The nose shows off the purity and power of Cabernet Sauvignon from this hallowed area with some of the best dark cassis aromas that I have smelled. In the mouth, the wine is medium bodied, with great texture that has the potential to get even better with more time. The tannins are firm and the acidity fresh- I was very happy to have thick slices of marbled, prime New York steak to act as a foil to this big wine. Our bottle was also layered and complex with a nod to Pauillac showing through in pencil lead hints. Best of all it was super easy to drink despite its size and complexity; a virtue that only wines of great breed have.

Sleek, racy wine with plenty of black fruits and cassis that explode in the mid palate, it possesses wonderful sweet tannins and texture throughout the finish. Impressive and delicious!  For the first time for me…2 Stars!

"**Don’t Miss** Spicy and floral with an excellent core of black and blue fruits with great polish and very smooth tannins.  This is the second wine for Ducru Beaucaillou but there is nothing second about it.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"I have enjoyed several bottles of the 2005 La Croix de Beaucaillou recently. That wine is showing fantastic! 2015 is very similar but will even show sweeter and more approachable earlier. It is a great wine for short to mid-term cellaring and the price should be reasonable.

"This classic wine, from a cooler vintage still has  a long way to go in the cellars, however after decanting it for say... 1 hour or 2, it delivers a nicely perfumed aromatics and a robust palate that really shows off its terroir.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Another '07 that is out performing the price point. The ultra old school style, which is usually pretty darn tannic until they're 20+ years old is actually showing extreme elegance in this cooler vintage. Big perfumed nose of mineral, gravel, dark cherry and exotic aged woods. Structured and mouthfilling, but not heavy or tight at all. For the quality and reputation it's great to take advantage of the odd vintage discount.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"What a great price for a wine from this level of producer! The Pessac-Leognan powerhouse makes long lived claret, and the 2007 is in a good place.  It is brightly fruited with cherry and red currant flavors, a little game and earth, and great sweetness of fruit.  The acid would go with a rich steak perfectly.

"K&L's notes in 2008 - Good entry...sweet middle. Aristocratic. Very good. At the UGC the wine was full and ripe. Big wine on palate and sweet mid-palate impression. Tannic finish. At the property the wine exhibited a deep purplish color and fine red berry aromas and flavor. On the bigger side. 50 hectoliters per hectare here which is normal. 70% cabernet and 26% merlot with the rest cab franc. This wine could be the best value in older Haut Bailly wines-one of our favorites in Bordeaux.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"A great vintage and one of my favorite Chateaux in Bordeaux. This wine has tons of sweetness from the perfectly ripe Merlot grapes and the backbone of Cabernet Sauvignon.  At twenty years old, it is ready to enjoy after decanting one hour. Try with rack of lamb.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"65% Merlot makes for a softer version of this great first growth. Tons of blackberry aromas mixed with minerals and stones. Great balance and one wine you can drink in a few years with one hour decanting.And it is half the price of the 2010.

"Another 2nd wine that showcases the marvelous 2015 vintage. And what we often say about buying second wines in great vintages really holds true. Les Tourelles needs some decanting of course, but it is all there, the floral notes, cocoa, cassis and yet earthy. Outstanding.

"There is nothing better than a wine that houses two seemingly opposite characteristics under the same cork. In the case of Malescot, it’s all about poise and power (the hallmark of GREAT Bordeaux). Malescot has fast become one of my favorite properties in Margaux, with the 2016 offering even furthering the case. Whether a Bordeaux neophyte or devotee, you are going to love this wine! Wonderful layers of ripe blue and red fruits are offset by savory complexity and long refreshing mineral tones. You will be hard pressed to find a more palate-pleasing wine at this price anywhere in the world.

"I discovered this wine while visiting the central coast with some colleagues. This a winery that probably few people have heard of and probably fewer have tried due to their small production. Two friends, one from a small town on France, and the other from a small town in Michigan, collaborated in the Central Coast to make this Cabernet Sauvignon.  Rich red fruit, silky tannin and bright acid are all found in this wine, but the focus and complexity is truly amazing. This a softer more pretty style of Cabernet that is for the fan of small boutique, hard to find wines.

"First made in 1999, this red-fruit dominated Cabernet hails from a seven-acre hillside vineyard just north of Lake Hennessey. Aromatically it is perhaps the most striking of the 2013s, if not for its complexity then at least for its intensity. It was a perfect preamble to how serious the following wines were going to be. Very silky, it had a distinct savory note and is very tightly coiled. The finish is lined with baking spices, bitter chocolate, and bright fruit.  It is a wine that seems to be apt to age, although not as demanding as the Vecina for example. Enjoy 2022 to 2035+.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Melbury’s neighbor to the west, it is the youngest of Bond’s vineyard designates, making its debut in 2006. An elegance and grace dominate this wine. Although aromatically reticent at the moment, it is night and day contrasted against Melbury’s density. Bright blue and black fruit frame a soft wine that never lacks for extract or depth. It evolves beautifully with a bit of air (all wines were popped and poured an hour in advance) and keeps showing another dimension when going back to the glass. Gorgeous now, but one that will be fascinating to follow for years.  Drink 2020 to 2030.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The nose of this wine says depth, structure, not verbiage I normally include for the nose, but in this case you can really smell the power. The aromatics are an array of cocoa powder, black currant, wild cherry hints of tobacco and leather. On the palate the wine shows depth and concentration but never heavy, you can sense this is a wine made in barrique there is that slight torque one gets from small barrels yet they barrique doesn’t flavor the wine. The flavors are still, dark cocoa powder, cassis, blackberry with hints of leather and bits of heather and truffle. The finish is long, focused and tense, this is a wine that will benefit greatly from a longer aging but even in just 6 months to a year it will blossom tremendously.  Complex, powerful Bordeaux styled Super Tuscan that shows the Panzano terroir.

"The 2nd wine of Chateau Chauvin is filled with berries and other red fruits and has a clean and sleek middle showing touches of limestone minerality.  Subtle oak shadings add complexity to the finish.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"I would say this was the unofficial winner of the tasting. This is a great price for this wine and it showed very well. The layered nose is almost floral, with spice, raspberry and plum. It needs some time open (two hours), and then the fruit comes through on the palate with plenty of plum and blackberry that lingers on the long finish. The tannins are more polished than two years ago, but it still finishes astringent. At this price, this is a great case buy that will have plenty of life coming out of the cellar.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Right now the 96 is dark and brooding, very leathery and still pretty wound up. There is a lot of good stuff here- savory, meaty notes, dark fruit, minerals galore - but the wine still has a way to go before revealing its full potential. Resist opening this now - but it you must, plan for a half day (at least!) of breathing time.

"I just love this wine. It is all that one could expect from an old style traditional Bordeaux. The Les Ormes de Pez has beautiful aromatics followed by fruit, earth and mineral flavors.

"From one of our favorite Spring Mountain producers comes this non vintage bordeaux blend. Consisting of two vintages and six different grapes, half on the valley floor and half on spring mountain, this wine is crafted to fit right in at steak and claret night, but could even moonlight during a cocktail and hors d'oeuvres hour! It has more of an old school napa edge to it; the dark fruit is restrained, not big and juicy, there are earthy and nicely integrated, not overt, oak qualities to it, along with acidity and fine, black tea tannin to wrap it all up. It is a well balanced throwback that will do wonders on your dinner table this weekend!

"Cain's non-vintage ""NV"" offerings are some of the Valley's best value reds.  If you are a fan of old-world styled, hearty red wines that carry a bit of a funky, bretty edge than this wine is a must try.  Unfortunately, this type of wine is a dying breed in California as most wineries are shifting towards the production of bigger, rounder and flashier reds.   The NV12 is a blend of 2012 and 2011 (59% & 41%, respectively) and consists of  50% Merlot, 32% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10%Cabernet Franc,  4% Petit Verdot and 4% Malbec.

"Some of the more esoteric wines coming from California, the entire Cain line tends towards a more French style with higher acid, more tannin, and often a little Brett. The Cain Cuvee, though, is spectacular for those looking to branch out of the ripe, rich end of Napa and explore some of its alleyways. Raspberry and cassis along with some leather in the nose are carried along by a fine acid core. A little earth balances the fruit and rather fine tannins create a long finish. Definitely a little off the beaten path for Napa, this is a perfect food wine for the colder months.

"Cinnamon and I enjoyed this claret last night with a ribeye steak and potatoes. Cinnamon decided to be avant-garde on this occasion, and instead of peas or green beans served pan seared padron peppers. We put a touch of truffle salt on the steaks after cooking them, and the meal turned out very nicely. How did the Gruaud work? It was predictably great with the food. This 1994 has the poise and power of a great vintage at 20 years old, and seems to just be hitting its stride. It has a huge amount of pure, dark cassis fruit, integrated but very present tannins, and lots of electricity on the long, mineral laden finish. It took discipline for me not to hog the bottle, but it was too good not to share fairly with Cinnamon!

"A good vintage that was spoiled somewhat by rain at harvest, the wines are a little lighter in body than they might have been otherwise but in all other respects are quite good.

"This bottle was a generous contribution from Sean Fernandez in our old and rare department at our 2000 Bordeaux wine dinner, and was a contender for wine of the night. It is composed of about 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 7% Cabernet Franc and 3% Petite Verdot. The Gruaud was the earthiest, most savory bottle of the whole tasting, and had a little bit of bret that in no way detracted from my appreciation of the wine. It had dark fruit and leather flavors and one of the best supple, medium bodied textures of the whole evening. It was seamless and beautiful wine that drank great now with balance for the ages.

"One of the stars of our annual Grand Bordeaux Tasting in Hollywood. Not an easy feat considering it was in the company of the likes of 2012 Mouton Rothschild, and Chateau Margaux! Captivating note of graphite, pencil lead and lacquer/cigar box, along with cocoa, cherries, cassis, and forest floor, and leather. A stunning wine.

"Tons of cassis and chocolate on the nose. Best at Joanne tasting. Amazing as usual--blueberry and blackberry flavors. Fabulous balance--one of the best of the vintage. Power with elegance.

"A few years back when we traveled to Bordeaux to taste the 2009 vintage out of barrel, we were served the 1989 Chasse Spleen at lunch at the Chateau. Given the opportunity to taste it again, I jumped at the chance. At nearly 25 years of age the wine is near its peak. The nose speaks of a mature Bordeaux - cedar and tobacco, leather and prunes. On the palate the ripeness of the '89 vintage shines through - loads of dark fruit - tart blackcurrant and fig jam. Tannins are quite fine with a bit of firmness remaining. Delicious last night with a grilled ribeye steak, roasted fingerling potatoes and brussel sprouts.

"Tasted at a recent Bordeaux dinner, this was a standout among a slew of venerable properties from great vintages.  Blind I might have guessed this to be from the 2000 or 2003 vintage due to the volume of youthful plump fruit, freshness and underlying power.  At 26 years of age this is amazingly plush and seamless with a silky texture to the dense middle and effortless length to the finish.  This is a very special bottle deserving of a place in every serious collector's cellar.

"The 1990 Montrose isn't just a 100 point wine, it's a 100 point wine from an era when Bordeaux was still in its old school phase. There was less pressure back then to make a modern and consumable product, one with ripe fruit and silky tannins that that masses could easily embrace. When you drink the 1990 Montrose, you get a level of secondary depth and complexity that I rarely taste in modern era Bordeaux. There are delicate herbal nuances, hints of violets, and an essence of cassis so pure and fragile that it almost dances across the palate. We had a bottle at dinner after the UGC tasting this past January, and even having tasted a number of great Bordeaux that afternoon, the 1990 Montrose still stood head and shoulders above the rest. It's a supreme wine from a supreme vintage, and it's a wine that truly merits both the price and the reputation. More importantly, it's a wine with a long, long future ahead of it. That's what any 100 point wine should offer.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Fantastic wine just entering the drinking window, ripe fruit with hints of cheese rind on the nose that tells you its a great one. Good acidity and searing mineral qualities with a hint of iron keep the wine fresh at 25 plus years.

"100 points Robert Parker-back when 100 points meant a lot.  This wine does not disappoint.  I tasted 2 bottles on 2 separate days in january 2017.  Both bottles were perfect.  Quite rich and full-bodied with a mouth coating flavor of cassis and some toasty oak. This is an intense wine and really does deserve 100 points--i was quite skeptical before tasting these two bottles. A fifty year wine for sure.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"One of the most singular wines for Bordeaux and the appellation of St. Estephe, the 1990 Montrose was a joy to taste.  Perfectly open but still with room to grow, this Grand Vin is stunning now at 26 years past the vintage.  The aroma alone is enough to get lost in, but the wine is extraordinarily poised, elegant, and composed.  This bottle came directly from our in-stock parcel (as of Jan 2017) that we received in the original cases and shows that properly stored stocks of this bottling live up to the billing.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"These old Chasse Spleen wines help me to better understand this whole wine aging thing. Why am I supposed to wait 20 years to drink this wine? Oh, this is why: soft, integrated tannins that ease effortlessly over the palate with a combination of flavors that just don't make it into the youthful versions. This is stunning wine that will impress you and whoever you decide to drink it with. Worth the money if you're going to really shell out for something nice.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"**Don’t Miss** Primary and saturated with intense cassis, framboise, fig paste, and light earth.  Plush and full on the palate but very fresh. You are getting so much wine here for the price. Excellent.

"Alter Ego de Palmer- This wine has just killed me in the last few years; I just love it! 52% M 42%CS 6% PV. This wine just may be the best tasting wine in Bordeaux over the last 10 years running. The old vine Merlot here at Palmer makes a spectacular wine with such delicious sweet fruit it is hard to believe it does not go into the first wine. Rich, black-red fruits with a little grip; so tasty, attractive and regal!  The only problem with Alter Ego is that it tastes so good it’s hard to stay away from and not drink it all young! 2 stars from me.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"If you do not want to pay the hefty tariff for Chateau Palmer then a pretty fantastic compromise is to buy the 2015 Alter Ego de Palmer at a fraction of the price of Chateau Palmer. Alter Ego has got to be one of the great values in all of Bordeaux! Normally I am not a huge fan of second wines but since the 2012 vintage I have been enamored with this wine. It is spectacular, loaded with pure red berry fruit, beautiful delineation, hints of spice, mineral and a touch of lively green herbs this racy, taut wine is a joy to taste. With impeccable balance and fluidity it is hard to resist it as a barrel sample so I am in a quandary to imagine how wonderful it will be from the bottle.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"As we heard from many properties in the Medoc “this is not a second wine” but another expression of the vineyards. Either way the Alter Ego is fabulous in 2015. The color is dark and inky, with black cherry, cassis and chocolate flavors that are intertwined within the lovely velvety texture of this wine. This wine is nearly exotic but still shows a wonderful freshness and finesse.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Very deep and powerful with underlying  sweet fruits of black cherry and herbal notes. This wine is very classic, strong with laser beam focus  and brisk acidity.  One of the long runners in 2014. 2 stars!

"There’s a resurrection going on at Mouton, a new facility coupled with a renewed effort equals outstanding wine. Herbs & chocolate notes dominate the nose, good length with fine tannins, loaded with dark berry fruits & bitter chocolate. Score: 3-3½ stars

"I brought a bottle of this to Quattro restaurant in the Four Seasons for their ""Friday Nights Uncorked"" promotion, when they invite you to bring your own wine. My oldest friend and I enjoyed the wine with Quattro's 16oz bone-in Piedmont rib-eye, and went for the black truffles on top for good measure. This is the biggest, ripest, most opulent Monte Bello I have tasted, and since Cinnamon worked up there for years I have been fortunate enough to taste a lot. At 12 years old it is still young, but certainly into its drinking window. I can't recommend it highly enough for a steak night!

"Second growth aged for 20 months in 50% new barriques, this elegant cab-merlot blend shows complexity with solid structure. Cola with bright fruit and an herbal earthiness, Leoville Barton is a bottle I would happily drink now, which is something special for such a young Bordeaux... aging will only improve this beautiful, well-integrated wine.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"There is wonderful balance and freshness to this substantial wine although a few more years in bottle will work wonders.  This is deep, dark and masculine with tons of blackberry and blackcurrant fruit, hints of cola and mineral and absolutely no hard edges whatsoever despite the size and depth.  The sense of balance and proportion are what sets this apart.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Very well polished with the classic notes of cola and cassis. The palate is structured for sure, but all its elements are in such harmony that one forgets it is only a 3 year old wine. Dark fruit, coffee, cola and violets. Quite a stunner.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Incredibly elegant and complex with aromas of violets, fresh herbs and ripe cherries.  The palate has an elegant soft texture while maintaining structure and expresses notes of fresh ground coffee, cassis and pencil shavings. This 2012 is a stunning bottle of elegant, classic Bordeaux that is integrated enough to drink now and complex enough to hold on to for a number of years.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Floral and fruity red with hints of vanilla. Medium to full body, fine tannins and a crisp finish. Loosely knit. This needs three or four years to come together. Better after 2018. A great wine for a great price. Can't miss.

"“Super Seconds” is a term we here at K&L throw around quite often to describe some of the best second wines from great Chateaus in Bordeaux. Wines like Clos du Marquis, Pavillon Rouge and Les Forts de Latour come to mind. Tremendous, and at one point at least, all incredibly affordable counterparts to their world famous big brothers. Forman’s ""Château la Grande Roche"" has long been one of the best “Super Seconds” California has to offer. From the same sites, made in the same way as Forman’s top wine, just with a little less time in oak, this is wonderful Cabernet-based wine that is wildly age-worthy and delicious in its youth, too, with just a touch of patience.  Dark and intense, this wine is brooding and powerful. If you just pop the cork and go, we think if you are going to drink this right away, certainly a decant is in order. Once this opens, with about an hour to an hour and a half in a decanter, it is pure old-school Napa Cab. From a few vineyards spread though out the valley, this displays some of the great dusty, graphite-laden, sandalwood and black currant aromas that Napa Cab has been know for historically. Black fruited and slowly unraveling, this has plenty of savory Cab flavors of dried sage, chaparral flowers and olive tapenade, and then underlying notes of sweet, roadside blackberries. Powerful and firm with long tannin intensity and slightly exotic spices in the finish this is something that should give you amazing return on investment in your cellar or a great wine to ruminate on over a long holiday/special occasion meal.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Year after year I'm impressed by Forman's ""Chateau La Grande Roche"" Cabernet.  I often find myself underwhelmed by second labels and understand why they didn't make the cut for a classified bottling.  Not this one.  It's structured and grippy, with notes of graphite, tobacco and black fruits.  Drink this guy in a few years or give it an hour in a decanter.  Great buy.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is one of my favorite ""second label wines"" we currently offer. The concentration, balance,  and approachable style the wine gives while still getting your Cab fix on while drinking it...with its depth, textures and life, it carries across the palate. Very serious stuff, for the money, to enjoy.

"67% Cabernet Sauvignon and 33% Merlot. Very spicy, with Asian spices and currant on the nose. Very expressive. Very pure and vibrant. Boysenberry aromas and flavors. This is a big wine, but with good balance. Not a massive wine. We like this one very much. R: Fine and floral aromas of perfectly ripe grapes on the nose continue all the way thru this incredibly elegant wine. Sweet, grapey, lush finish. Great wine!

"Bursting with bright red fruit and eucalyptus on the nose, this blend is sure to please the palate looking to be fully enveloped in gorgeous fruit, supple tannins, and a smooth finish. This quite simply, over-delivers!Although I have been hell-bent on drinking the 07 and 09 vintages because of their delicious fruit and roundness, I may have to start reconsidering my stand on the 2010’s!

"I’ve been a fan of St. Clement Oroppas for years! This has been a wine that consistently over-delivers  year-after-year vintage-to-vintage. If you’re seeking out the structure of a Bordeaux Red coupled with the fruit and seamless feel of a California Cabernet Sauvignon then your search has ended: drink the 2010 St. Clement Oroppas. The wine starts out with aromas of black plums, cola notes, mocha and hints of clove and eucalyptus. The palate is a mix of dark macerated berries, Baker’s chocolate and spice notes nicely buffered by racy acidity and soft mocha-laced accents. The wine is amazingly approachable and easy drinking in its youth but can easily age 5-15 years. A delicious wine that carries on the tradition of Oroppas being one of the better Bordeaux blend values made in Napa Valley.

"This overachieving and consistent property has come up with another super affordable winner in 2014.  This starts with rich aromas and flavors of oak, blackberry and spice that race along the smooth, dense middle.

"The most opulent of the First Growths in 2016 has an almost flamboyant fruit profile but stays firm, dry, powerful and super fresh on the finish.

"This is the best first growth I tasted from 2016--very much in the vein of the great 86 Mouton with softer fruit, so almost like a combination of 82 and 86.  The wine is utter perfection, in my my top three for 2016 overall. Only Lafite and Petrus are as good, in my opinion.

"I am still amazed how refined this wine showed. Rich cassis fruit and mineral aromas jumped from the glass. The tannins were polished, with a refined but rich mouthfeel lush with cassis, pencil lead, mineral and cedar. The finish was long and full of cassis and oak spice. Excellent for the vintage.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"A fantastic effort from the Palmer group and Thomas Duroux.  Big reduction in volume here as the mildew caused 20% less crop. Blackberry and Asian spice aromas that fill the room. Serious wine and one of the best of the second wines in the Medoc in 2016.  Only 6,000 cases produced.  Powerful yet smooth as glass on the palate. A winner and must buy.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"With many of the attributes of Chateau Palmer but in a more approachable style this is a fabulous 2nd wine for the vintage.  There are flavors and aromas of black cherry, cocoa, spice and crushed flowers in the deep, sweet but elegant mid-palate.  12% Petit Verdot impart strong tannin to the finish but this fresh, fine wine is balanced and easy to taste.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is silky, sweet, seamless and pure with great balance between the opulent fruit, elegant middle and satin finish.  Flowery scents give way to flavors and aromas of dark plum, blackberry, cherry liqueur and baking chocolate that stay precise and articulated.  More voluptuous than Chateau Margaux and my favorite of the appellation
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Grand Vin is 47% Cabernet Sauvignon 47%M 12%CF with 65% new oak. The wine starts with sweet, delicious black-red fruits with great viscosity, a bit firmer and stronger than Alter Ego but the tannins are finer and rounder, literally seamless. In my opinion it blows away Ch. Margaux. 3 Stars!

"**Don’t Miss** Scorched dark fruits, deep with excellent flesh (30+ year old vines) and notes of blackberry coulis, mint, lavender, and earth.  Medium bodied with a velvet finish. This is from a separate parcel and not the second wine of Leoville las Cases.

"Most times while tasting at Lafite “En Premier” I am puzzled by the majority of the wines, including Lafite but especially by this wine. Not with this time. This wine showed sweet and savory, loaded with ripe fruit while still maintain wonderful freshness and lift. This should be a drinker right upon release but has the structure, acidity and freshness to age well for mid-term cellaring.

"My old time favorite Bordeaux Chateau has done it again with this excellent 2012.  Cedar aromas and toasty oak mixed with blackcurrant flavors.  Sweet and sexy-you must decant 2 hours before enjoying it in near time.  Can't miss wine.  DO NOT neglect the 2012 vintage.

"The third wine in a trio of single-vineyard 2009 Cabernet Sauvignons from Sbragia, the 2009 Sbragia “Wall Vineyard” Mount Veeder Cabernet Sauvignon is a structured, broad-shouldered Cabernet Sauvignon with aromas of chocolate-covered cherries, mocha, caramel and tobacco. The palate is dark and brooding, with flavors of plum, eucalyptus, blackberry liqueur and notes of crushed rock and baking chocolate. The wine is supple, with a finish that echoes the palate, and it slowly dissipates on the tongue.

"Consistently one of the very best properties in the Médoc, Chateau Potensac has been owned for many years by the Delon family of Leoville Las Cases in St. Julien. The quality of the wine can be attributed both to the superb character of the terroir and to the additional resources made available due to its long association with a top Deuxième Cru. It can be difficult to properly judge this wine when tasting at the Chateau, since you are obliged to evaluate it alongside the more prestigious Clos du Marquis and Leoville Las Cases itself, but more than in any other vintage I can recall this 2016 Potensac more than held its own. Even in such august company the quality was readily apparent. The wine showed exceptional concentration. Bright and lively in character, very fresh, and with loads of sweet, ripe fruit and fine tannins, very much in line with the vintage as a whole. One of the most intriguing things about this 2016 Potensac is the higher than usual percentage of Cabernet Franc. One theme we heard over and over again during en primeur was that due to the extreme conditions of the vintage – from very wet to very dry – the oldest vines faired best. The vineyards at Potensac include a parcel of Cabernet Franc vines more than 80 years old. The grapes from these vines in 2016 were of such a quality that they were among the best the estate produced and formed a key part of the blend. You may tire of hearing this regarding the 2016 vintage, but, truthfully, I have enjoyed many vintages of Potensac over the years, but this may be the best I have ever tasted.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"A perfect 5 for value here in 2016.  The far north of Bordeaux did not suffer in the long drought. The heavy clay soils held the moisture. This is the best young Potensac I have tasted and at this great price, which is less than the 1997 vintage( of which we sold 18000 bottles it is a steal.  Tons of blackberry aromas and flavors.  Unlike most young Potensac, this wine is super aromatic and super sweet on the palate. You will be drinking this wine for many years. A must buy!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"A lot of changes have taken place at Larkmead over the last few years, but none of those moving parts have affected the quality of the wines. In fact, these wines are as good as I can ever remember them being. The new winemaker, Dan Petroski, who has his own brand Massican, and has worked for the likes of Valle dell'Acate in Italy and DuMol here in the States is one of the great up and coming winemakers in Napa. He has taken a more detail oriented approach with fermenting and keeping separate all the parcels of the vineyard until blending. This approach has made the wines a bit different than in the past, in my opinion, channeling specific lots into each of the proprietary bottlings.The Cabernet in 2013 is awesome, plain and simple, but it is much more spice and earth-driven than in years past. With considerable loamy earth qualities backed by laurel, dusty black currants, menthol/camphor and touches of Tiramisu, this is heady and intriguing aromatically. With more old school tannin/acid interplay and a rustic texture, this has really become serious wine that I think is going to age effortlessly. Flavors of cedar, cigar smoke, baking chocolate, eucalyptus, tar and boysenberry are already very well integrated and continue to come together and evolve in the glass. Savory edged throughout, this is a rare Napa Cab that impresses with structure and complexity rather than with sexy, bombastic fruit. I couldn’t be happier with it.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends

Great silky texture on the palate and a long strong finish. Serious wine that I will buy again for my collection. Among the greatest buys in all of Bordeaux wine in 2016 that include Cantemerle, Ormes de Pez, Meyney, Goulee and Maucaillou. Ralph Sands
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The main reason I love Poujeaux is that I can collect this wine in EVERY vintage. The price to quality ratio undeniably lies in the consumer’s favor, as this wine is always fairly priced. Poujeaux has character and a unique terror that always shines, from the great vintages to those inevitably more challenging years. The 2016 is a textbook example of this Chateau. Understated poise and polish with a wonderful balance of fruit and savory flavors on the palate. Poujeaux never lets me down!

"2011, rain, boo, right? Nope, think again on this one: Montelena is so old school about their picking regime, they picked before the drenching rains of the later fall of 2011. The rest of the year was cool, true, but basically the year that Napa became Bordeaux-for-a-season. This wine, tasted January 2018, initially shows an aroma that could be called herbal, maybe mineral, but then the red fruit flavor shows up, intense and alluring. It's the vintage, out of a lineup, I kept thinking about again.

"Commenting on the extreme weather conditions of 2016 – from the heavy spring rains to the late summer drought – the good folks at First Growth Chateau Margaux characterized the year in typically understated fashion as “a singular vintage”. If it was a vintage to test the mettle of vineyard manager and cellar master alike, then Margaux passed with flying colors. This 2016 Margaux, Margaux is very much a wine of the vintage. Notable acidity, very fresh and lively, with a mere 13% alc. Hugely tannic but so very fine it was easy to taste even out of barrel. At 94% of the blend this is a vintage for Cabernet lovers. While yields were slightly up here in 2016, the selection for the Grand Vin was quite strict, a mere 28% of total production, down from 35% the year before. Where 2015 was opulent, the 2016 is precise. This is a sleek greyhound of a wine, a marvel of focused intensity and restrained power, a wine of great finesse and elegance.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Chateaux Margaux is the absolute definition of poise and grace. The 2016 offering is ethereal and complex, even a bit introverted at this early stage. As with all world-class wines, greatness lies below the surface. A bouquet of black fruit, rose, lavender and violet grace the nose, which is accompanied by a palate of uncompromising precision and purity. Faint hints of leather, cedar box, and minerals lend to the intrigue. The 2016 is lower in alcohol than previous vintages, which adds tremendous vibrancy. The 2016 Chateaux Margaux is a collectors dream - nothing but a long and happy life lies ahead.

"As usual one of the top wines of the vintage. 65%CS with 30%M and rest PV and CF. Not a monster like 2010 nor as voluptuous as their 2009, but it is 1/3 the price!!

"We were fortunate to taste the 2016 Labegorce three times during our En Primeur trip, and the single adjective that stood out from each of my tasting notes was - “WOW!” It’s hard NOT to fall in love with this wine and the team at Chateau Labegorce. Tremendous passion, proficiency and enthusiasm translate to a wine that will not disappoint. Notes of Asian spice, flowers, bay, cedar and minerals leap from the glass, leading to supple and sweet palate impression. This wine displays great follow through, given its perfect balance of fine tannin and fresh acidity. Incredibly complex for the price, the 2016 Labegorce is sure to please.

"A perfect score from me considering the low price.  One of my top 5 from the Margaux region and that says a lot with the neighborhood that includes Palmer and Margaux. We had this wine three times and it was off the charts good every time. 52% Merlot which is high for the property. Such an intense nose of Asian spice and black cherry. Violets on the palate. Very feminine style-so precise.  SO DELICIOUS. A must buy-it will sell out quickly.  As good as it gets for any wine from anywhere for this price.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This property is on a role since the 2009 vintage. This may be their best yet. 55% Merlot here. The violets of Margaux are here in spades. So perfumey and so sweet, you can drink it now.  Plenty of latent tannins under this massive amount of sweet black fruit flavors. Sexy and lush.  Value!

"There is nothing better than a wine that houses two seemingly opposite characteristics under the same cork. In the case of Malescot, it’s all about poise and power (the hallmark of GREAT Bordeaux). Malescot has fast become one of my favorite properties in Margaux, with the 2016 offering even furthering the case. Whether a Bordeaux neophyte or devotee, you are going to love this wine! Wonderful layers of ripe blue and red fruits are offset by savory complexity and long refreshing mineral tones.

"This is full, rich and almost extravagant but held in check by the integration of powerful structure, wonderful proportion and a finish of fine, ripe tannin. From an appellation that was a roaring success in 2016 this is a relative bargain.

"Noon at Ch. Malescot. One wine to taste with Jean Luc Zugar. 55% CS, 37% M, 6% C,F 2% PV. The 2015 was a 3 Star beauty and the 2016 is again a fabulous 3 Star wine. Perfectly extracted ripe grapes and great tasting, fine blance, tannins and long finishing. 3 Stars and also by FAR the greatest value for great Margaux wine.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Another standout with fantastic berry fruit, baker’s chocolate and super-silky tannins with that unmistakable Margaux feel. This was the biggest seller we had for the 2015 Bordeaux offering. This wine is vying with it for the crown of best in store. Bright and lively. So lush and ripe. Jean Luc Zuger has fashioned another top wine for 2016. This wine is a bit more precise than the 2015.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Dark chocolate, cherry, smoke, char and tons of mineral characterize this precise, fine powerhouse.  This has everything in harmony from the beguiling aromatics, to the fresh and sweet middle  and the finish of polished tannin.  Exact and weightless.

"Huge wine here and some think one of the best of the vintage.  Wonderful nose of cassis, spice, and toasty oak.  Depth of flavor off the charts.  An ager for sure.  Hopefully not a crazy price.

"Phelan Segur actually has large holdings very close to Chateau Montrose. In 2011, an extensive renovation was completed and Michel Rolland consults. Full bodied and muscular, deep fruited with black fruits and spice. Looking forward to see how this develops.

"Blackberry jam aromas.  Intense and fruity.  Black cherry flavors with plenty of mineral undertones.  Long and lush on the palate with a lingering finish. 60% Merlot.  Stunning value.

"We tasted this wine before dinner at Domaine de Chevalier and I was thoroughly impressed. The wine was plump and dense with dark fruit, but balanced by a mineral note that one would associate with wines of the Graves. I like to think of this as baby Demaine de Chevalier. It's made by the same dudes!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"Another Sleeper from 2015! Ripe upfront fruit leads into a silky fleshy middle, which is followed by a long, lingering finish. Flavors of graphite, mineral and sweet herbs dance along the edges of this wine. Really tasty and should be very approachable upon release.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"I tasted a barrel sample of this wine last September and I was blown away! Saffredi is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot but grown along the Tuscan coast. The hallmark of the 2015 vintage for me is the sweet fruit purity is totally evident, the fruit just sings, ripe yet focused, complex and really engaging. On the palate the wine is bold, rich yet not fat, it has superb balance and length, the fruit character is so complex yet open at the same time a revelation. The finish is fresh, lifted and just seems to go on forever, a hint of toastiness now but that will age out by the time the wine is bottled and released, a fabulous wine!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is sweet, clean and completely correct,  with all the elements present for a classic Pauillac.  Once this fleshes out it should be a delicious bargain from an appellation that soared in 2016.

"A Bernard Magrez wine so it has a bit more new oak aromas and flavors.  Very California Cabernet style here with over 50% Cabernet. Polished wine with sweet berry aromas and flavors.  Easy to drink right now, but it will age gracefully for 10-plus years.  All this for under $30.

"Tasted it twice, same note: black as night, huge wine with deep extraction, serious fruit and tannin. A wine that lovers of big California Cabernets will enjoy

"The Wing Canyon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon is a subtly nuanced, fine Mt. Veeder Cabernet at an outstanding price point. This producer usually doesn't distribute outside the winery, and the opportunity to taste this small production gem is rare. Medium bodied and expressive, with a complex bouquet of licorice, dried rose petal, cinnamon, clove and all spice, this wine has a very well integrated soft tannin and a coursing, balanced acidity that will cut through and complement most dishes. All lovers of Napa Valley Cabernet must try this special wine.

"Chateaux Margaux is the absolute definition of poise and grace. The 2016 offering is ethereal and complex, even a bit introverted at this early stage. As with all world-class wines, greatness lies below the surface. A bouquet of black fruit, rose, lavender and violet grace the nose, which is accompanied by a palate of uncompromising precision and purity. Faint hints of leather, cedar box, and minerals lend to the intrigue. The 2016 is lower in alcohol than previous vintages, which adds tremendous vibrancy. The 2016 Chateaux Margaux is a collectors dream - nothing but a long and happy life lies ahead.

"If you buy Bordeaux from K&L, you undoubtedly know Chateau Cantemerle. As a sales staff, we all secretly hope to find a bottle amongst the lineup for our quarterly Bordeaux staff tastings. Some of us will even drop hints to Clyde, hoping he will blind taste us on an older vintage from his cellar. Needless to say, tasting the fabulous 2016 offering at the chateau was close to a religious experience. This is by far one of the best wines I have tasted from this beloved chateau. Aromatically there is so much intrigue - loads of cinnamon, raspberry fruit, cedar and spice. The palate delivers rich sweet fruit, silky edges and wonderful freshness. By far, a standout from the 2016 vintage.

"Les Pagodes de Cos is the second wine of Cos d'Estournel grown from younger vines on the same terroir.  Modern, round and ripe with dark red fruits, plum and mocha.  Balanced and rich finish.

"A real winner from the 2016 vintage for the money! This wine shows a wonderful silky texture with an exotic sweet core of red and black currant fruit that lingers on the finish. A sleeper!
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The nose of this wine says depth, structure, not verbiage I normally include for the nose, but in this case you can really smell the power. The aromatics are an array of cocoa powder, black currant, wild cherry hints of tobacco and leather. On the palate the wine shows depth and concentration but never heavy, you can sense this is a wine made in barrique there is that slight torque one gets from small barrels yet they barrique doesn’t flavor the wine. The flavors are still, dark cocoa powder, cassis, blackberry with hints of leather and bits of heather and truffle. The finish is long, focused and tense, this is a wine that will benefit greatly from a longer aging but even in just 6 months to a year it will blossom tremendously.  Complex, powerful Bordeaux styled Super Tuscan that shows the Panzano terroir.

"The Hermes people have really brought this property to the forefront in Listrac.  Buy the 2016 as they lost most of their 2017 crop to frost. 52% Merlot here and the wine is so soft and elegant.  The old school Listrac hardness is gone-just pure fruit in this one.

"As we heard from many properties in the Medoc “this is not a second wine” but another expression of the vineyards. Either way the Alter Ego is fabulous in 2015. The color is dark and inky, with black cherry, cassis and chocolate flavors that are intertwined within the lovely velvety texture of this wine. This wine is nearly exotic but still shows a wonderful freshness and finesse.

"2015 Labegorce, Margaux – Toasty ripe aromas are followed by a sweet and juicy mouthful of fruit. The middle fruit lingers on through to the finish. There is some structure and a fair amount of tannin but the wine is balanced and still fruit driven. Should be a nice pick for mid-term cellaring!

"Only 39% of the harvest was used in the grand vin and includes 40-100 year old-vine Merlot grown on gravel soils. Cos d’Estournel has one of the most privileged terroirs of St-Estèphe on the southern slopes of the hill of Cos. They also use all gravity flow throughout the winemaking facilities. Dark and spicy with currant, black fruits and graphite. Firm but rich fruited and dense from the old vines.

"I travelled to Oakville to see my high school friend and baseball teammate Bart Araujo, who is most notably known for his Araujo Eisele Cabernets. This time I went to taste his new project Accendo-Accendo Cellars 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon is outstanding.  Very much like a Bordeaux first growth in richest and complexity while holding the line on alcohol and oak. Red fruits abound on the nose and palate with nuances of Asian spice and cinnamon. Lush mid palate with great acidity and very round tannins.  Like 2009 Bordeaux the fruit here covers the tannins. So sweet on the palate I drank three glasses-I don't spit these kind of wines. yes it is expensive but well worth the price.  Bravo! Only 500 cases produced.

"The Rothschilds of Lafite have been continually improving this property since 1973 and the quality has soared.  This is tight, clean, dark and sweet with classy lines and good intensity.  By the time this is released it should have ""plumped up' and be its usual hearty and chewy self but I suspect this will always one of the raciest wines from this property.

"Boy -this property under the guidance of the Rothschild team has improved greatly in the last 20 years.  The wines are softer and more elegant than before. This 2016 is lively and fresh--so sweet for a Listac.  Big body and full on the palate, but great acidity and round tannins. Great value.

"I never thought that I would be able to say this, but St. Estephe is the home of value for thoroughbred Bordeaux! This concentrated, even chocolaty, exotic claret  has power and dark fruit to spare. It also has a surprisingly elegant, long, dry finish and very good complexity. If you are looking for a great bargain in 2015 for the cellar, look no further! This magnum will keep for a very long time, and is ideal for anniversary year or children's birth year purchases!

"We never see small production Cabernet with a Napa Valley designation that comes with a sub-$100 price tag.  Compound that with the fact that the wine is from arguably the strongest vintage we've seen in the last 40 years and you have one of the best pound-for-pound values on the market.   Load up on these because there isn't much to go around.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"This is a no-compromise effort from the great 2013 Napa vintage that shouldn't be overlooked.  Deep cassis and black cherry highlight bright aromatics and a composed and well-balanced effort.  It has the structure to age for another decade and a half, but will thrill any Cab lover sooner than that with a quick decant.  The folks at Red Stitch have been making serious wines for over half a decade now and this will most likely mark their greatest release to date.  Tiny production here - around 250 cases produced.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"A great wine to buy when it arrives.  13.5% alcohol and 85% Merlot.  Smokey, toasty, tobacco aromas with blackberry fruit on the palate.  Could be their best ever?  Meanwhile enjoy their 2005, 2009 and 2012.
",Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends
"The wine’s nose is classic cabernet, pencil shavings, cassis with bits of cigar box but behind it some dense fruit. On the palate the wine has the breadth one would expect in Cabernet but its Tuscan heritage adds length to balance, more fruit shows on the palate than in the nose and it is deeper and darker. The finish is fine, elegant balance with a bit of lift in the finish. Super wine, capable of aging for 20 years.

"The 2010 vintage may not have been as talked up as the more forward 2007, but this wine comes on like a more subdued version of 2007: a savory, sage aroma with a dusty, gravelly background opens up to a medley of brown baking spices and sweet fruit, finally, revealing itself on the palate. Clean, old school Cab! Tasted from 1.5L, January, 2018.

"As usual one of the top wines of the vintage. 65%CS with 30%M and rest PV and CF. Not a monster like 2010 nor as voluptuous as their 2009, but it is 1/3 the price!!

Coufran has an unusual Merlot heavy blend that always offers a lovely amount of very smooth textured dark red fruit above earthy and minerally notes.  I predict the 2015 will again age very well, as the rich amount of fruit is balanced nicely by great structure - at this price it will be tempting to drink it up early, but a few years in the cellar will truly reward you.

A Cabernet based Bordeaux blend, the wine is elegant and expressive of Atlas Peak, which sees a significant drop in temperature in the evenings, encouraging acidity and concentration of flavor.

The 2006 Achaval Ferrer ""Quimera"" is a stunning blend of Malbec, Cab, Merlot and Cab Franc that gives the wine a distinctive Bordeaux feel but never lets you forget it is more of a New World wine. The wine has excellent structure and body with rich tannins and dark fruit flavors that meld nicely with the rich oak accents. This wine has the stuffing to age easily for 10 years but can also be opened up tonight also and enjoyed with a big, juicy steak. If you're looking for a wine that is a little bit different than your everyday California Cabernet or Bordeaux, then try out this little gem from Argentina.

",Carignane
"We worked our supplier connections pretty hard to get as many bottles of this sub 3,000 bottle production gem of a wine as we could. Vigno represents an association of growers who source old vine Carignane from Chile's Secano interior section of the Maule Valley, an area which, for Carignane lovers (count me in) arguably produces the best examples of this grape variety in the world, right up there with bottlings of Priorat which often sell for nearly three figure prices. Derek's 2014 VIGNO is a masterpiece of the genre. It opens with one of those explosively bright noses where you can smell the freshness and acidity, a fine beginning to be sure. The palate shows incredibly energetic, lively black cherry and wild berry fruit flavors, a freshness that betrays the low 3.2 pH, as well as the fresh granite, quartz and red clay soils in this section of Chile's coastal range. It is one of the few wines I've tasted recently that I simply could not spit out - it's that good, and I suggest you buy some before we run out.While we secured, by my calculation, about 10% of the production, as I mentioned earlier on that is still a very tiny amount!

"Dits del Terra is one of two single vineyard Carinena based wines, what proprietor Dominik Huber describes as his ""1er Cru"" bottlings. This shows incredibly intense aromas of blackberry and licorice that are brooding in a way. Wonderfully pure, dry and mineral laced  flavors on this young Priorat. German born Dominik Huber did not to my knowledge grow up in a winemaking family, though he did grow to develop a love of good food, cooking and fine wine, and decided to venture into wine production in the beautifully rustic Priorat region of southern Catalonia accompanied by his then business partner, South African savant Eben Sadie. Having learned over the years how to spot a great vineyard, and more recently, how to harness the fruit to retain all of the Mediterranean character with maximized mineral expression and freshness through thoughtful winemaking, Dominik now is right up there amongst the top few projects in Priorat.

"Here we go with some good old fashioned Geek wine. This hands off  Santa Ynez Carignan really took me where I wanted to go without any of that wet dog stuff some might be expecting. A beautiful translucent ruby in the glass. The nose is brambly red fruit and hints of earth. Tons of acidity and mineral on the palate with that earthy red fruit taking over. There's this wonderful elegant subtle tannin, but the most striking thing is how clean and precise it is as a whole. An exciting wine to free you from the over-ripe doldrums that have become the norm in SoCal Mediterranean varietals.
",Carignane
"A great example of a cool climate mazuelo (a.k.a. carignan / cariñena) from Spain. Both on the nose and on the palate, fresh, crunchy dark & red fruits are expressed; think plum and dark cherries. A hint of spice accents this quite nicely, as does the earthiness on the finish. A fantastic choice in a food pairing applications to accompany grilled fish or game meats
",Carignane
"Mazuelo (Carignane) is a key component to the Rioja blend. That said, it's not the easiest vine to cultivate and yield tasty results. For those who have well sited, mature vines, and the patience to wait a bit longer to harvest, however, you can get something really fantastic, though it is rarely bottled on its own. Here is one of those rarities, Mazuelo de la Quinta Cruz, from a vineyard planted to a particularly stony parcel of land - it is a tiny plot and therefore an extremely limited production. Bright, red fruited, and somewhat earthy, gamy, animal all at the same time. This is perhaps Merino's most original bottling.
",Carignane
"I liked this wine from the start. It is bright with lively fruit followed with a hint of earth. Light to medium bodied  it is easy to drink and enjoy. While delicious alone, I think that it will go well with chicken or pork.
",Carignane
"California Carignane? Really? Unblended?! Well, this super affordable, mind blowing version is just the finest domestic example I have ever had. Beautiful depth, with red plum, cola, and clean spices. A great pairing for so many different foods from chicken to game bird to light beef. If you are looking for something unique and delicious, this is it!
",Carignane
"Hands down, this is one of the best pound-for-pound Chardonnays in the store right now.  Boasting notes of grapefruit, white nectarine, chamomile and a touch of oily richness - there is no reason that this value white should not be featured on your Thanksgiving dinner table.  It's the perfect dinner companion for any occasion really, but especially those coming up in the next few months!
",Chardonnay
"Easily one of the best white wine values I have tasted this year, the 2016 Domaine Lafage Novellum is the epitome of what the Languedoc/Roussillon is capable of producing. This rich, textured and complex white is layered in tropical fruit notes and baked apple flavors. The wine unfolds with a seamless feel as fruit note after fruit note blends with soft oak nuances. This is an outstanding value that pretty much blows away anything from California that is even remotely close to its price.
",Chardonnay
"This is a great daily sipper that will not disappoint. Despite the name there is nothing little about it - plenty of tart, citrus flavors and very vibrant acidity pop upfront and the finish is long. Petit Chablis is not inferior to Chablis -the difference is simply in the soil type and exposure to sunshine (terroir!). If you're looking for one with more texture and richer fruit this won't be your wine. BUT if you're looking for fresh, crisp, clean and easy drinking, this Petit Chablis should be your choice.
",Chardonnay
"This Chardonnay is crisp and stylish with lovely flowery fruit and plenty of depth, energy and concentration underneath and a very long finish. Love this Petit Chablis and white Burgundies at affordable prices!
",Chardonnay
"The 2016 Petit Chablis from Louis Moreau is a Direct Import for K&L, and one of the greatest value whites carried here. Pressed from grapes from younger hillside vines, this light-bodied wine displays barely palpable waxy aromas of orange blossom and lemon, and a distinct, chalky minerality. The palate is very well balanced, with bright but well-integrated acidity, and the finish is long and tapered.
",Chardonnay
"A stellar value, the Petite Chablis is loaded with bright citrus fruit notes, wet stone and hints of seashells.
",Chardonnay
"There's much to love about the wines under the Kalinda label - variety, quality, flavor and value. If you enjoy a leaner style of Chardonnay, this should hit the spot. Plenty of lemon and green apple notes, electric acidity and a smooth, easy finish makes this an easy choice when you're shopping for a refreshing wine to end (or start) your work week.
",Chardonnay
"Clean, somewhat floral aromas intertwined with pineapple, red apple, and stone fruit. The citrus pop on the palate, combined with a balanced level of acidity, make this chardonnay the perfect compliment to any lighter meal or appetizer. The lack of oak/butter flavors make a lawn chair and music a great pairing as well.
",Chardonnay
"After living in Sonoma County for two years, and drinking plenty of wine from the region, you could say I've definitely had my fair share of Russian River Valley Chardonnay. The Kalinda 2016 Chardonnay is not only a great value, it's also a fantastic Chardonnay coming from California, packed with apple and citrus notes. The acidity is well balanced and near perfect. If you're the type who usually doesn't like California-style Chardonnay (possibly because it's too oaky, or even buttery) I'd say give this bottle a try, as it is the complete opposite of what we all come to know and expect from a typical California Chard. And for the price, you really got nothing to lose.
",Chardonnay
"A delightful summertime white--the perfect ""poolside sipper."" Quite elegant and soft. Some citrus notes and fine acidity.  Not your overblown, full-throttle California Chardonnay--just an easy-to-drink white value wine. Apple aroma and flavor with a fresh, lively finish.  This was made by a very famous Russian River Valley producer. Note our new label. Alas, our names are not on the label.
",Chardonnay
"Like a tropical dream!  Mango, pineapple, guava and kiwi intermingle with notes of vanilla creme brulee.  This is bright and lush, with a vibrant acidity and a long finish.  For those looking for a plush California Chardonnay without the toasty quality of oak.
",Chardonnay
"Lemon, tangerine, toast with butter, meets warm spice and nutmeg, and a distinct savor of vanilla custard in this iteration of Spellbound. If you are hankering after a lavish style of Chardonnay at an inexpensive price point, this could be the answer to your desire!
",Chardonnay
"This is a great wine for fans of  that ""typical"" California Chardonnay profile: rich, textured, plenty of fruit and oak that makes its presence known but is well integrated. The majority of white wine shoppers that I encounter don't think about Italy when it comes to Chardonnay but I am happy to introduce them to similar styles from a region they wouldn't normally consider.
",Chardonnay
"Have that friend that claims they hate Chardonnay? Pour them a glass of this and watch the conversion happen before your eyes! Absolutely gorgeous crisp and floral bouquet hides its varietal on the nose. On the palate, the wine is round and very texturous with juicy weight. The alcohol level is perfectly balanced, making this bottle super versatile. From post-work, to dinner, to the night cap, this is an awesome bottle of Italian white than can do it all.
",Chardonnay
"I've long admired the Antinori family's commitment to the preservation of a fair number of significant estates in different locales within Italy. They purchased this particular property, Castello della Sala, in 1940, which is not only beautifully restored but also houses a world class winery and vineyards. Their Cervaro, having been produced since 1985, is a clear reflection of their desire to make a great white Umbrian wine and of their vision of what that should be. This unique blend of Chardonnay and Grechetto has developed a huge following and the 2015 is a stunner. Cervaro weds a richly textured and flavored-packed international style palate with underlying old world terrior, bright acidity and a pleasant kiss of oak on the finish. Although delicious now, it will certainly broaden with time in the cellar.
",Chardonnay
"The nose of this wine jumps out of the glass, a wave of nutmeg, butterscotch and vanilla on top with baked apple underneath, at first it’s reminiscent of a Napa Chardonnay but the difference lies on the palate.  The wine comes alive on your tongue, vibrant acidity lifts the center and extends the richness it is also freshened by the use of 10% Grechetto a local indigenous variety that gives a bit more fruit. While having all the trappings of richness this wine still has an energetic drive, a real zip that makes it an excellent food match. A complex  long lasting finish that is a mixture of texture, crispness and spiced fruit goes on and on.
",Chardonnay
"As I lifted the glass to my nose, the smell of dry white minerality, sweet Meyer lemon and hints of toasted oak send my mind to high-end white Burgundy. It is an elegant, balanced, and nuanced Chardonnay that blows any competition out of the water. A gentle acidity keeps the wine long on the palate while the rich texture allows it linger on your tongue. While I am certainly enjoying the wine on its own, a food pairing of salmon, halibut or even a garlic roasted chicken sounds unbelievably delightful!
",Chardonnay
"Love, love this wine! Bright and brisk, full-bodied but with incredibly clean mineral profile and impeccable freshness. To me this wine is on the same level as 1er Cru Chassagne-Montrachet. If I'd taste it blind I'd say it's Burgundy, because of its precise balance, wonderful acidity and overall pure flavor. Finish is long and lingers on and on.
",Chardonnay
"Burgundy From Umbria? Currently one of the best white wines of Italy, this offers complex aromas of cream, toasted oak, and is full-bodied, very rich, with loads of fruit enhanced by hints of wood and lots of minerality. Incredible length on the finish.
",Chardonnay
"Olivier Bonville carries on the tradition of his grandfather, Franck, producing wines of incredible richness and complexity from his estate vines in the Grand Cru villages of Avize and Mesnil on the picaresque Cote de Blancs.  It has the rich flavors of Anjou pear, Meyer lemon, white apricots and a touch of delicate spice.  The real magic is in the chalky minerality and zippy acidity that the Cote de Blancs is famous for.  When you consider that similar offerings from the Big Houses cost three to four times more, this becomes a must-buy for anyone calling themselves Champagne enthusiasts.
",Chardonnay
"This is one of K&L's best selling Champagnes for a very good reason. The Bonville family has some of the best terroir imaginable for growing Chardonnay--every acre that they own is super chalky, east-facing Grand Cru on the Cote des Blancs. They have been making their own Champagne here since the 1920s, and growing here for many generations before that. This is their entry level bottling, and what a way to start! It is made of at least half reserve wines, giving it not only the dry, chalky drive that makes this area famous, but also giving the wine toasty, creamy, delicious drinkability. A must-try for any Champagne lover.
",Chardonnay
"This is basically the non-vintage champagne that everybody wants, everybody needs, and everybody can have! It checks every box. It suits any occasion. It fits nearly any budget. It delivers in every single way. Perfect blanc de blancs nose, vibrant soft white fruit, fresh crisp apples and citrus, slight saline, and that grand cru chalkiness that you can't miss. Lively, pointed and open - it slips from the glass like a slithering snake, just disappears. Where did it go? I don't know. Buy another.
",Chardonnay
"One of the following three statements is true, and the others are false! Let's see if you can pick the fact. 1: THE EARTH IS BIGGER THAN THE SUN2: STANLEY KUBRICK WAS HIRED BY NASA TO FAKE THE MOON LANDING.3. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET HIGH-END CHAMPAGNE FOR LESS THAN $35.Well? What do you think? I was on the fence between the moon landing and champagne, UNTIL I opened a bottle of this unbelievable Grand Cru offering from what has become a huge staff favorite here in Hollywood. Immensely refreshing with clean peach and citrus fruit, subtle vanilla, and a long finish, this amount of deliciousness is even more ridiculous than those two false facts! Think about it!
",Chardonnay
"The Franck Bonville Grand Cru Blanc de Blancs is crisp, refreshing and vibrant with just the perfect balance of green apple and lime on the nose and palate. This cuvee sets itself apart from other Blanc de Blancs with how the Bonville family is able to create a creamy, full-bodied palate in conjunction with the bright and zesty flavor profile. They were able to achieve the harmonious balance between the acidity, the elegance, finesse and balance in this entry level cuvee.
",Chardonnay
"Update 2014:  The 2011 Vintage in Champagne was pretty terrible, turns out to be a blessing in disguise for one of my favorite bottles of Champagne in the store. Wanting to make sure he kept the quality up, Olivier Bonville declassified all of his high end and old vine vineyards into this little gem.  The depth of fruit and minerality is what catches me off guard when I drink this wine, light and elegant, the chalk in the soils sing through the nose and offer a back bone that frames the entire wine. White flowers, golden apple, and a hint of spice cake.  Vintage Champagne in disguise.2011: The picture of elegance and class. Such pure and clean lines, a touch of citrus, a hit of minerality all delivered effortlessly on a find bead and sensuous mouth feel. One of my annual holliday favorites and sure to please any Champagne snob that might haunt your gatherings.
",Chardonnay
"Fresh and racy, showing crisp apple and citrus, with hints of mineral and brioche rounding out the palate, this focused and elegant Champagne is as good as--or better than--its previous incarnations, and remains a steal for the price.
",Chardonnay
"I was reminded at today's Champagne staff tasting of what a fabulous bottle of bubbles this is for the money. Based mostly on the 2007 vintage, with the rest older reserve wines, this Champagne offers an expressive nose of golden apple, creamy lees, chalky minerals, and the subtlest of baking spices. It is full on the palate, with a creamy mousse lended structure and power by vibrant acidity. The chalky mineral component adds edge and focus to the long finish. Its richness and fruit offers broad appeal, but its complexity and depth promise to intrigue even the most discerning of palates. This is a superb Champagne to enjoy now and over the course of the next five years, for any occasion!
",Chardonnay
"The best deal in direct import Blanc De Blanc Champagne Yet! Its an entire staff favorite here at K&L, and once you try it you'll understand why. Its elegant and pure but has a richness on the palate that is creamy and fulfilling. This is my personal house Champagne! My favorite Champagne under $50 by far! This has no hard edges at all; it's completely seamless from start to finish. Crisp, with elegance, round and creamy richness, the Bonville is full of bright fruit and mineral notes. As much fun as bubbly gets! Try it ASAP!
",Chardonnay
"When it comes to Champagne this is probably our all time staff favorite.  The fact that it is a direct import and sells for less than half what it would if it went through the same distribution system as the big name brands doesn't hurt either.  Fresh and ripe Chardonnay flavors, intense mineral notes and hints of earth leap from this vibrant and full-textured bubbly.
",Chardonnay
"This is another outstanding, easy to like champagne from Bonville. 100% estate chardonnay from three vintages, this bottle intertwines clean citrus and crisp apple with solid, chalky minerality to create some seriously great bubbles. Refreshing alone on a warm summer day or paired with some of your favorite seafood appetizers, this champagne is sure to please.
",Chardonnay
"Always one of our best direct import champagne producers!  Clean, crisp, bright - and the price is amazing!
",Chardonnay
"Made from all estate fruit from Bonville’s Grand Cru vineyards in Avize, this champagne displays ripe citrus and apple fruit on the nose, followed by a rich mid palate and a snappy mineral finish.  The Bonville Prestige has everything I am looking for in a Blanc De Blancs at an extremely reasonable price!
",Chardonnay
"For me, one of the best finds at our recent Champagne tasting! It's off-dry, with beautiful fruit and a nice toasty nose. All this from third generation winemaking family whose holdings consist of 15 hectares of Grand Cru vineyards. The winemaking here is all about elegance and finesse and allowing the terroir to speak for itself and it shows.
",Chardonnay
"This may be the best deal in Champagne that K&L offers. 100% Chardonnay. 100% Grand Cru fruit from some of the best vineyards in the Côte des Blancs. Don't write this wine off because you didn't pay more for it! This is an outstanding Champagne at an unbelievable price. It will delight you with its rich, creamy texture. Ripe pear and chalky mineral notes give way to toasty, fresh baked apple tart on the mid palate. The wine finishes with a crisp, zingy citrus note of Meyer lemon. Enjoy this wine alone, as a refreshing aperitif or together with chilled, cracked Dungeness crab.
",Chardonnay
"What a great producer Franck Bonville is! This excellence shows in the Brut Selection Blanc de Blanc. When one opens the bottle and pours some of this Champagne into a glass, beautiful aromas are the first teasing impression. The Champagne is dry and crisp with clean delicate flavors. Great alone or with lighter foods.
",Chardonnay
"If there is such a thing as a Champagne for everyday use, well this has to be it. Not because of the price, but for its quality and poise. Very crispy, citrousy end elegant. Perfect for hors d'oeuvres, seafood, egg dishes, guacamole, goat cheeses, and ""fantastic"" with caviar!
",Chardonnay
"Very easy to like - soft textured, citrus and cream flavors.  Plump, round and delicious.  For someone who usually goes for a bit lean and austere, I'm always surprised I like this as much as I do. It's just delicious stuff.
",Chardonnay
"There is simply no better Blanc de Blanc in the store at this price! Classic Avize minerality with crisp apple-y fruit, lemons, limes and wet stone aspects. A wonderful Chamnpagne with caviar or baked Brie. Too good of a value to pass up. We can also go for months without having this sparkler in stock. Also available in 375ml and magnum. It also comes in a gorgeous 2002 vintage as well!
",Chardonnay
"The Oncle Vincent is currently my favorite, best-value white Burgundy on the shelf. And let me tell you, this bottle is fantastic. With notes of butter, star fruit, a little bit of oak, the Oncle Vincent's acidity is well balanced, and overall, this Chardonnay is a great time.
",Chardonnay
"The “Oncle Vincent” Cuvée pays homage to Vincent Leflaive, uncle of Olivier Leflaive, who died in 1993. This wine is the richer, rounder offering of Leflaive’s two Bourgogne Blancs, the other being the delicious ""Les Sétilles"". The differences are even more apparent with the riper 2015 vintage. The “Oncle Vincent’ shows a rich, broad mouth-coating texture, which shows flavors of golden apples, white peach and cream. The finish is long and juicy.
",Chardonnay
"An absolutely fantastic value Chardonnay that truly delights.  Stylistically, this wine is crisp and lean, verging almost Burgundian in style. No malolactic fermentation in the winemaking process, and all stainless steel aging. The Central Coast sun does allow for a certain level of ripeness to develop, lending itself to exhibit tropical fruit notes. On the nose, pineapple and melon aromas initially, with orchard fruits like white pear and pear emerging along with citrus zest. Tertiary notes of citrus blossom, green herbs, mint, and stones. On the palate, the wine is juicy and lively. No richness from oak, but the round nature of Chardonnay inherently does come through, as does the ripeness of fruit. Crisp and minerally on the finish. For the unassuming price of this wine, there is definitely no shortage of flavor and liveliness all for under $15.
",Chardonnay
"All tank-fermented and lee-stirred with no malolactic, this is outrageously delicious Chardonnay showing plenty of white currant, pineapple, and tangerine skin notes, with gorgeous fruit purity, medium body, crisp acidity, and lots of n varietal fruit that is surprisingly complex and rich with great zestiness. I love what the Varner Brothers can do to a grape varietal, without putting a heavy thumb print on it.
",Chardonnay
"The delicious 2014 Foxglove Central Coast Chardonnay is a phenomenal value for anyone who desires a clean, full bodied, unoaked Chardonnay. The wine doesn't undergo malolactic fermentation, and bright citrus fruit and earthy minerality shine through. The second label of Varner, the Foxglove label consistently offers elegant, high quality wines from premier vineyards at remarkable prices.
",Chardonnay
"After all these years in the wine retail trade, I am still captivated by the notion that two neighboring Macon Villages of Burgundy (Pouilly-Fuisse and Saint-Véran) can have vastly different prices for the same grape (Chardonnay), produced in virtually identical styles, and, in most instances, from the same producers. The concept for this vast price variance (Pouilly-Fuisse retailing for fifty percent or more than Saint-Véran) stems from the fact that many Americans way back when thought it much more romantic and classier to say at a restaurant, ""I would like to have a bottle of Pouilly-Fuisse with this dinner, waiter,"" than to ask for a bottle of a much more mundane, rural sounding word as Saint-Véran, thereby creating a much greater demand. What amuses me the most, I believe, is the fact that this ""variance"" has been able to sustain itself, even with many of us wine ""specialist"" telling everyone that this pricing is stupid. This gorgeous, estate Saint-Véran from the Renauds is a perfect example of just how brainless that notion of pricing can be. Tons of bright apply, melon-like to lime zest tones with a slate-like mineral undertone abounds in the nose and on the palate of this remarkably rich, well-structured, classic style Chardonnay from that village of Macon and will rival any exceptional Pouilly-Fuisse. The finish is bright, clean, and crisp and invites another glass or two or three. Rizzo has asked me to bring home several cases of this finely crafted Gem for our near-term consumption over the next two to five years. A REALLY, REALLY NICE VALUE!! >>>A K&L WINE MERCHANTS’ DIRECT IMPORT<<< !***** 13.0% ABV *****
",Chardonnay
"Refreshing and packed full of energy, this St. Veran is dry, clean and crisp. It has a nice delicious mouth feel and mineral nuances. A perfect choice for  an unoaked Chardonnay fan. It will go well with fish and fowl.
",Chardonnay
"The Renaud wines have been my “go-to” picks for many years now when I am looking for inexpensive refreshing Chardonnay. The St Veran is probably the most aromatic wine in their line-up. The mouth is round and creamy with nearly tropical fruit and hints of toast and spice.
",Chardonnay
"It's back! This St-Veran was the best under $20 bottle of Bourgogne Blanc we had last year and it's just as amazing this year. It's incredible to believe that a bottle of wine that tastes this good, and that comes from Burgundy, can be less than $20! Stock up because this wine will not be here for long!
",Chardonnay
"In the Domaine Renaud line up, the St. Veran is one of my favorites. I find it to be a little brighter, lighter and have more complexity.  While still a richer style Chardonnay with notes of yellow orchard fruit and intricacy from the older vines, the wine is well balanced. The fresh flavors of Meyer lemon and dry minerality will last on the long finish. A great Chardonnay to enjoy alone or with food!
",Chardonnay
"This was my favorite offering from Domain Renaud last vintage and a gateway for me into white Burgundy. I have eagerly awaited the return of this wine and fortunately this vintage seems to have raised the bar yet again. I am again astounded by the approachability and complexity of this wine. Green apple notes with a soft mouthfeel and hints of lemon peel and grapefruit zest. Although there is acid here to give lift and drive it is less sharp than other wines from the region. Instead the wine showcases a pleasing richness while maintaining a clean finish. After tasting this vintage I am still surprised by the fact that this wine is under $20. This is a small producer so buy a case before it is all gone.
",Chardonnay
"Classic Chablis at an great price! Who would have guessed you would see those tw words in a sentence?  Classic, with bright acidity and lemon/lime flavors, minerals and a bit of chalk. From older vines, so there is a hint of riper fruit peeking out between start and finish. Green melon, limestone and apple dominate the overall character and there is also a soft, though lingering finish.
",Chardonnay
"Louis Moreau is the sixth generation of his family to make great Chablis, and the pedigree shows in this well-priced 2016 vintage of “de Biéville.”  Made entirely in stainless steel, it spends about 4 months on the lees which gives it a rich texture, with a crisp edge from brisk acidity.  Rich flavors of green apple, honeydew melon, meyer lemon, and white flowers are expressive and focused, with great calcareous minerality. I think this is the best Chardonnay deal in the store. 
",Chardonnay
"Bieville is back! The 2016 vintage may not possess the same weighty palate that the  hot 2015 vintage did but all the classic flintiness, citrus profile and racy acidity that Chablis is known for is all there.
",Chardonnay
"A super value Chablis that expresses its uniqueness.  This wine is elegant, crisp and well-structured.  This 2016 Chablis is chalky with a mineral quality. The wine is mouth-filling and full, with a smooth and supple finish.
",Chardonnay
"Beautiful gold color with a great freshness on the nose that wafts out of the glass. Green apples, peaches, a touch of palate weight, and a not-overly-acidic pH make this a great summer dinner wine or pool side sipper.
",Chardonnay
"While I haven't tried previous vintages from this producer yet, I have to say I am definitely becoming a fan of Olivier Leflaive. If you want a nice easy drinking white burgundy, the Les Setilles is filled with citrus flavor, light and pineapple, and bright acidity.
",Chardonnay
"It's time to hurry in and buy your Bavard Blanc before we are out again! Unfortunately we were only able to buy smaller amounts from Bavard in this vintage, but what we do have is highly worth your while! While we have been a big fan of this producer for awhile now, the 2015 vintage is absolutely flawless.  Bavard has struck the perfect chord with his Blanc, achieving a true Puligny character, with a great depth of fruit and minerality in the core, balanced by clean floral notes and a citrus-driven acidity. This wine is likely one of the best values in our White Burgundy offerings to date.
",Chardonnay
"Cornmeal, toasted Challah bread, nectarine and minerality fill the clean and linear nose on this fully weighted wine. Fleshy, rich and with a pleasing light creaminess this is a bold enough Chardonnay to please the “bigger is better” fans but still has so much fruit complexity and a wealth of stone and spice components that people that enjoy more “traditional” Chardonnays should take note. Passion fruit, more buttered toast, orange marmalade and a pleasing flowery quality all intermingle on the full and well formed palate. This is something that we really think is tremendous for the value and should make a lot of friends with its generously friendly style over the summer and well into the fall.
",Chardonnay
"Looking for a juicy, tropical fruit-laden, oaky California Chardonnay without the typical high price tag? This 2015 Hahn Chardonnay fits the bill! Ripe pear, mango and citrus fruits with a nice complement of oak lend great texture to this tasty, easy-drinking Chardonnay for just $20.
",Chardonnay
"The Hahn SLH Pinot Noir is a big customer favorite and this Chardonnay is another fantastic value. Lush and aromatic, this Chardonnay shows fresh lemon zest, orange blossom and vanilla with a rich, round texture and balanced acidity. At the $20 mark, this is an easy going white that is sure to be a crowd pleaser.
",Chardonnay
"The 2015 Hahn Santa Lucia Highlands Chardonnay is perfect for anyone who loves a big, creamy style, but with subtlety and delicacy. The Hahn estate is family owned and run, in a cool climate region in Monterey County, and the Chardonnay is crafted in a way that reflects the family's effort and care. The wine is  hand-stirred on the lees and crafted from fruit grown on the elevated and terraced Hahn estate vineyards, and the result is a wine that is perfectly balanced in fruit, body and acidity. Aromas of cream, golden delicious apple, ripe mango and kumquat entice, and a rich, full bodied and fruit-driven palate with hints of candied lemon peel leave a delightful impression.
",Chardonnay
"The only problem with this great Champagne is the production- it is only one press load so we can't get very much! This Champagne is all Chardonnay from two long rows in the Monts Aigu parcel of the Grand Cru of Chouilly- right across a small path from Cramant. If you love the high class toast of Taittinger’s Comte de Champagne, this is a bottling that you don’t want to miss. The Chardonnay in this bottle has top notch concentration and texture as well as a complex array of flavors; baguette, succulent nectarine and bright chalk. This wine is labeled as Extra Brut since the dosage is very low, but while it is quite dry, it is not overly austere. It has one of the longest finishes of any type of wine that we carry- truly top notch!
",Chardonnay
"The perfect celebratory Champagne! A special 2007 release from staff favorite producer Alexandre Le Brun, the ""Cuvée Fascination"" Blanc de Blancs is an investment well worth it, especially as a gift for more sophisticated palates. Sharp nectarine fruit and chalky minerality sing together through the palate, and the super low dosage makes for a dry yet lingering finish.  This is high-quality Chardonnay, taut and linear but still approachable, with electric acid and biscuity leesiness.  We’re down to just a few bottles, so get it while you can.
",Chardonnay
"One of the loveliest Champagnes  I have tasted recently. Precise and exquisite. Blanc de Blancs is my favorite type of Champagne and ""Fascination"" has everything I love: fresh and bright aromas with hints of brioche and white flowers. Dry, very focused palate with deep, rich flavors of citrus fruit and little bit of toastiness, beautifully balanced with a long mineral finish.
",Chardonnay
"This vintage bottling is 100% Chardonnay, full of an expressive nose of raisins and apple blossoms. The chalky texture and mineral-driven body are what I really enjoy about this great wine from a small producer. Enjoy — I am sure you will!

"This 100% Chardonnay is organic and has an excellent, clean character. There is some richness mid-palate for complexity and elegance. One of my favorite Champagnes at present!

"Young Alexandre Le Brun has to be one of the most exciting winemakers in Champagne right now. His wines have wowed staff and customers alike here at K&L. This wine is hand selected from just two individual rows of Grand Cru Chardonnay vines. The fruit is pressed in one single press load and received 8 long years resting on the lees. As with all of Le Brun's wines there is a knife edge balance of power and delicacy. The textures are fine, the clarity and precision of this wine is simply breathtaking. Compared to some big house, advertising driven, ""luxury product"" Champagnes the quality here is embarrassingly good for the modest price point.
",Chardonnay
"This wine never disappoints. The nose is superbly fresh with generous aromas of ripe pear and apple while on the palate it is packed with lemony zest, soft, round texture, nervy acidity and a long, lasting finish.
",Chardonnay
"Lime zest, tropical fruit notes, and a floral bouquet make this Macon Village stand out from others at the price point. The palate weight suggest a bit of neutral oak, but without any oak or butter flavors. Absolutely delicious.
",Chardonnay
"If you want to know what a ""classic"" White Burgundy smells like, buy a bottle of this.  Apple, citrus, banana, toast, nuts, mineral, baking spice, anise any of the aromas that you have seen on the images trying to illustrate Burgundy are here, Beyond that the palate is medium weight, it is clean and very persistent with good extract.  This is great Chardonnay.
",Chardonnay
"Slowly I'm falling back in love with Domestic Chardonnay and it's because of wines like this! You wouldn't expect anything less in a Chardonnay coming from a producer than has such deep roots in Burgundy, but this wine is a true reminder of how on par Oregon Chardonnays can be with their bigger brothers. The Arthur is chock-full of savory on the nose that instantly transports me to France, but not just to Burgundy. The aromatics of clove, floral and almond skin faintly remind me of a great aged Savenierre. On the palate this Chardonnay is fresh and bright but also has a coating texture due to the mix of both stainless and oak aging. This Chardonnay is a true crowd-pleaser that is sure to delight everyone from your creamy malo lover to even the most finicky and discerning of palates.

"This is beautiful terroir-driven, French-style Chardonnay that exudes elegance. It is a clean, pure expression of Chardonnay from Willamette with aromas of fennel and white flowers, and flavors of pith, wet stones, almonds and white nectarines. And you get all of that ethereal beauty for under $30.

"The Arthur Chardonnay from Domaine Drouhin is a great representation of the plentiful 2014 Oregon vintage and a good match for those who like Burgundian style wines. There's a bright acidity that's elegantly combined with white floral, lemon zest, vanilla and baking spices. Enjoy this wine now, or hold onto it for a few years and I'm sure it will be even more fabulous.
",Chardonnay
"Arthur is steeped in aromas of light toasted spice with a hint of  vanilla. Showing it's Burgundian roots with an elegant, and restrained approach to the rich and creamy style of Chardonnay, the mid-palate exhibits a clarity of pear and apple fruit and shows plenty of depth with an intriguing stoney minerality that drinks absolutely deliciously! A super quality for the price, and super recommended!
",Chardonnay
"Wonderful Oregon Chardonnay from a classic producer. This bottling is whole cluster pressed Dijon clone Chard with a mix of oak and stainless steel aging. It goes through natural malo giving it a wonderful richness without feeling fat and heavy. It maintains a bright snap and vibrancy to go with the lovely baking spice and apple notes. Great wine, great vintage, great producer, AND a great price -- it is a must try!
",Chardonnay
"I am a huge fan of Oregon Chardonnay, and it has been exciting to be here at K&L where I feel like we are a little ahead of the game when it comes to stocking and appreciating it. That being said the Domaine Drouhin Arthur is not some hidden gem only we know about, this wine, from this well known winemaker has turned many heads and for good reason. The 2014 vintage showcase the beauty of Chardonnay from the Dundee Hills. Citrus, white stone fruit, and floral notes are lifted and carried by the acid in this wine. A touch of oak gives a nice toasty quality to the wine. Essentially this is one of the gold standards for Oregon Chardonnay.
",Chardonnay
"Loads of clove, cinnamon and baked apple on the nose of this young Chardonnay.  The palate is racier than expected.  While 2014 is a very lush, hot vintage, DDO's house style is consistently balanced in terms of acidity and ripeness. The wine is produced entirely from estate fruit (Dijon clones) and is fermented in both tank and barrel.  This Chardonnay is always a show stopper in my eyes, and frankly, it's cheap considering the name and quality behind it.
",Chardonnay
"This value-priced label from Oakridge showcases the exceptional quality of these wines, at every price. The Chardonnay is one of the best we offer under $20, regardless of region of origin, however winemaker David Bicknell makes the most of the Yarra Valley's cool climate to produce a perfectly poised wine that combines generous fruit with lively acidity, full-bodied yet fresh in style.
",Chardonnay
"I love the Oakridge label, and to be honest their entry level Over the Shoulder is usually my favorite thing that they do. The OTS line represents an absolutely stunning value for the beauty and complexity that are present in the wines. In the Chardonnay there is generous ripe orchard fruit that is driven by clean acid and a bright freshness that keeps the wine from being heavy. A spectacular wine in its own regards this style also happens to be extremely versatile, pairing well with a number of foods and style preferences.
",Chardonnay
"Probably one of our best values in Chardonnay, vintage after vintage! While this Chardonnay does not lean toward the large, oak-laden variety, it does still exhibit some richness and texture to complement the orchard fruit on the palate. Overall, it is a cleaner, crisper style of wine, with beautiful creamy white pear and honeycrisp apple notes.
",Chardonnay
"Always a popular wine because it offers nice, juicy and round fruit paired with oak and butter flavors. It is very easy to drink and can be enjoyed alone or with fish or chicken. A classic California Chardonnay at a great price.
",Chardonnay
"Here is a classic California Chardonnay. This wine has exhilarating aromas of honeysuckle, pear and green apple, with hints of pineapple. On the palate, this wine is rich and full-bodied, with lively fruit, sweet vanilla, butterscotch flavors and a refreshing, long, lingering finish.
",Chardonnay
"It's rich, ripe, buttery, and yes, it's back!! Partially barrel fermented, this wine has a softer texture than it has had in previous vintages.  Viscous and lush, this is a wine with a built-in fan base and a price point that makes it move quickly.
",Chardonnay
"Ten bucks. That is all. Just $10 gets you this tasty little non-oaked Chardonnay from one of the premiere appellations of the Central Coast of California. Some of you may think it’s too “cheap,” that there is no way that it can be good at that price point. Well I’m here to say that we think that you shouldn’t discriminate based on price because there is some serious substance in this Chardonnay. Don’t overlook the little guys, the underdogs; if you do you might just be missing out on the best Chardonnay deal of 2017. Orange blossom and a pure beam of Cantaloupe and Honeydew melon, bolstered by a leesy weight, ride high on the nose of this non-oaked stunner. Broad but that broadness comes from fruit ripeness rather than oak extraction this is packed full of pureed Jonagold apples, orange pith, fried plantains and hints of zestier citrus tones like tangerine and Clementine. Add in the fact that there is 10% Sauvignon Blanc, 3% Gruner Veltliner and 2% Pinot Blanc in this wine and which add fruit complexity, minerality and a spice note to the wine and this is incredibly complex without oak or secondary fermentation. A value not to be missed.
",Chardonnay
"This Chardonnay is a no-brainer! The Lincourt no-oak Chard is clean and refreshing with aromatics of yellow fruit, white nectarine and melon. Throw in a surprisingly medium-bodied palate and a zippy tart finish and you have the perfect spring soiree wine!
",Chardonnay
"This wine is reminiscent of the success we enjoyed last year when we released the value-driven Alma Rosa Santa Barbara Chardonnay.  It's totally unoaked, showing notes of grapefruit, yellow nectarine and Mandarin oranges.  If you prefer linear styled whites and a touch of ripeness, this is a wine you should be buying by the case.
",Chardonnay
"While I love the amazing selection of value wines here at K&L I almost always go perusing through the offerings from France, New Zealand, or Spain hanks to our Direct Import program. So I was somewhat surprised and very pleased when I got to taste this $10 Chardonnay from Lincourt. The wine has a little fruit weight and showcases notes of white stone fruit and apples. There is no oak here so the acid come through really well, more balancing than bracing though and the finish is clean. All in all a perfect little white to throw into a party or drink on a Tuesday night.
",Chardonnay
"What can I say, this is incredible for the money. Fresh lemon peel and hits of sweet orange, first welcome you to the glass. The palate is clean and fresh and full of richness. Fresh herbs and bright lemon acid elevate this wine while the long finish leaves you wanting more. This might be one of the best $10 California Chardonnay's on the shelf. Cheers!
",Chardonnay
"I love a good unoaked Chardonnay that's inexpensive and this certainly fits the bill. Lincourt's Steel Chardonnay is a happy medium between crisp and juicy with plenty of citrus, melon and peach. There is a great expression of Santa Rita Hills fruit that won't disappoint in the upcoming warmer months!
",Chardonnay
"La Chablisienne has become on my go to labels when looking for spectacular white Burgundy in all price points that consistently over delivers. The 2016 bottling of inexpensive Bourgogne Chardonnay is a great example of the quality one finds in even the entry level wines from Chablisienne. Having no oak influence gives this wine lovely brightness and acidity but it would be a mistake to think that it has no weight or texture. There is still plenty of beautiful rich fruit at play giving notes of golden apple to supplement the minerality and freshness of this bottling. While I feel this is a splendid food wine there is no reason this cannot simply be enjoyed on its own.
",Chardonnay
"Perfect for the customer who wants an everyday white that displays citrus notes along with mineral and saline qualities—and zero oak.
",Chardonnay
"Delicious and elegant, this paper-wrapped Champagne is a departure from the searing acid of Blanc de blancs and instead shows golden apple fruit up front, followed by toastiness and a luxurious mouthfeel. Though there is a crisp backbone of minerality from the fossil-rich soil, this is a slightly unusual offering in that it’s 100% Chardonnay with a creamier spin. The current release is from a single vineyard and spends over five years on the lees.  Paul-Vincent Ariston is committed to making exceptional value Champagne, and there’s no doubt he’s accomplished that here. Aspasie Blanc de blancs is textured and age worthy, and I love turning savvy drinkers on to this family-owned favorite.
",Chardonnay
"Lovely wine. Bright, fresh, excellent combination of chalky, zestiness and nutty, toasty lees quality. The texture is fine and really drawn out on the palate. I am a fan of Aspasie's ""entry level"" Carte Blanche...but this is a cut above and worth the small increase in outlay.
",Chardonnay
"I recently enjoyed this while relaxing in a hot tub on a nice summer evening in California; it was perfect! Fresh and pronounced flavors of pear and apricot combine with a crisp acidity and lush creaminess for a wine fresh and approachable in style.  The perfect accompaniment to any moment of leisure, at a price far below its value!
",Chardonnay
"A great wine from Champagne under $40?! I was shocked not only at the price, but the wine inside the bottle is really great stuff. It is a perfect sparkling wine for entertaining or at your dinner table. The apples/pear fruits on the nose and palate and the expressive nature of this wine makes it appeal to palates almost all the way across the board.
",Chardonnay
"The Aspasie Blanc de Blancs  is a bottle I  reach for time and time again. Perfect for almost any occasion that I can think of, from parties to picnics there is something here for everyone. From the immediate aesthetics of the clear glass holding in the beautiful straw gold elixir, to the beautiful breadth and depth  that comes from single vineyard Chardonnay. Sun ripe stone fruits greet you, followed by lemon curd and a hit of toasty baguette. The textures is opulent, a kiss of minerality, and a long beautiful finish.
",Chardonnay
"I opened this magnum as business petered off on Christmas eve for the staff here in the Redwood City store, and it made me a popular man at K&L. Carrying a magnum around to the various work stations put a smile on many faces here, and the wine inside the bottle kept those smiles. This wine is single vineyard, from the very steep Gouttes d’Or site in Brouillet, and has a very different style than the Chardonnay from the Cotes de Blancs. This is creamy, decadent wine, and great on its own in the final moments of the retail rush…or just about any time! I need to buy this for my cellar.
",Chardonnay
"I just threw our family's first baby shower for my brother and sister-in-law, and this was the Champagne of choice to celebrate the new little life on the way! I love this Champagne for its easy and yet elegant personality. Apple, cream, citrus, and mineral with the stunning golden wine visible through the clear glass. It looks gorgeous on ice at a party, and its accesibility make it a total win for Champagne neophytes and connoiseurs alike!
",Chardonnay
"Since their beginning in 1794, Ariston Pere et Fils has been the true epitome of a “grower-producer” Champagne house. The Ariston family has worked together for 5 generations to harvest and gently press the grapes in their own cellars to obtain the balance and finesse that represents their signature house style and terroir. What’s remarkable when tasting the Ariston Blanc de Blancs is that you can truly smell and taste the fossil rich soil.  You can close your eyes and envision the steep hillsides drenched in sunlight as the grapes surrounding you ripen to a golden apple flavor.
",Chardonnay
"Elegance and complexity combine to make this an incredibly intriguing champagne. Delicate white flower and toasted almond/hazelnut on the nose give way to soft pear and a hint of vanilla on the palate. Gorgeous now, but I'm excited to see how this wine develops in the next few years!
",Chardonnay
"The Ariston family are some of my favorite winemakers who produce some of the best small-estate champagnes that we carry. This blanc de blanc is no exception. It carries their reputation for excellent quality at an affordable price. This is a creamy, rich style of blanc de blanc with a rich mousse and lemon meringue flavors. Fleshy, without being heavy, it has a long, subtle finish of apple and pear fruit. A great way to start a party or meal!
",Chardonnay
"The current disgorgement of the Ariston Aspasie Blanc de Blancs Brut Champagne is perhaps a little firmer, a little less open knit than previous bottlings. But the tradeoff is more focus, more purity, and more length. Quite dry, but with remarkable sweetness of fruit and a light toast that adds depth and character. The ideal New Year's Eve companion - complex enough to be interesting but not so serious as to dominate the conversation.
",Chardonnay
"Wow what complexity for $35.  The nose is nutty toasty rich with some hints of pumpkin seed and spice.  Strong smashed apple and fabulous lift.  Totally on point for the price.
",Chardonnay
"The Aristons' vineyards are vastly different than those of the the other blanc de blancs producers that we carry in the store. This is a creamy style Chardonnay Champagne that is always a crowd pleaser. An excellent value.
",Chardonnay
"Crisp and clean with light fruit on the palate, this Ariston Blanc de Blanc is a real crowd pleaser! Apple nose and a creamy body balanced with a solid mineral mid palate makes for a slightly more complex blanc de blanc thats affordable. Grab a couple bottles for your next occcasion!
",Chardonnay
"Ariston has done it again! They have created a Blanc de Blanc Champagne that is so unique and special compared to all the typical blanc de blancs on the shelf. Right off the bat after the Champagne Pop you get a whiff of the aromas of fresh baked brie, ripe apple, and Gruyere fondue...followed by a mysterious mid-palate chalk full of minerals and body. This isn't your typical super racy and tight blanc de blanc. It is fully developed into a mature ready to drink state of mind. Finishes with caramelized fruit and nuts...Enjoy!!
",Chardonnay
"Chardonnay from Brouillet makes a richer, creamier style of Blanc de Blanc than other areas of Champagne.  This is an easy to like style that is perfect for less formal occasions like New Year's eve toasts and quiet sipping during parties.  This generous, rich bubbly is an amazing deal to direct buy pricing.
",Chardonnay
"We can never get enough Launois Quartz at K&L. Unfortunately; the production is limited as Bernard Launois only has so many grapes each year in the great Mesnil plot of Les Chetillons. Having access to single vineyard, estate, grand cru Champagne from one of the best growers in the region at such a fair price makes me proud to be the Champagne guy at K&L. This wine has a fabulous white fruit quality that few Champagnes get at any price, and a chalky laser beam finish that is pure Mesnil. No Champagne we carry sells out faster.
",Chardonnay
"Produced from the Les Chettilons parcel, Launois decided to showcase the particular terroir of the parcel by producing the cuvee with only 4 atmospheres of pressure instead of the standard 6. In reducing the yeast and sugar content needed for the secondary fermentation, the aromatics of ripe stone fruit, like white nectarine and soft peaches become more predominant. And with less bubbles, the glycerol, full bodied texture supports the abundant amount of ripe fruit that lingers from the mid-palate all the way to refreshing finish.
",Chardonnay
"The Quartz is the leaner, more focused entry level wine from Launois and it might be my favorite. Underneath the fruit you get down into the minerality and the oyster shell notes that you expect from a fine Chablis. It's just that this wine has bubbles and it makes you feel like you're floating on air. Stunning.
",Chardonnay
"When I first came to work here I would have people come up and ask if we had any Launois in stock, not being familiar with it I was always curious why so many people would eagerly await their arrival. Now having tasted them I understand why we always sell out of everything we carry from them. The Quartz is light, crisp, clean, and downright crushable if I may use a vulgar term for this wine. The bright acid carries hints of minerality and tart apple and green melon that is still balanced and finished so well. This will disappear fast so it is worth picking up whenever we have it.
",Chardonnay
"Wow this is a fun Champagne!  If you love Launois Champagnes like I do, please note that the “Quartz” is different than their traditional richer style, but equally well made.  Zesty acidity with a touch of citrus and white peach livens up your taste buds.  This Champagne is light and crisp, yet elegant with notes of soft creamy mousse to balance everything out.
",Chardonnay
"Great wine that is a little more reserved than most of Launois' rich, decadent style. From a single vineyard and bottled at a slightly lower pressure. Soft orchard fruits abound, some fleshy peach character and a nice toasty note on the finish with our being overly buttery of nutty. This restraint allows the quality of fruit to show through a little more precisely. Excellent value.
",Chardonnay
"This lower pressure Champagne, coming from the single vineyard Chetillons is another astounding deal from Launois.  The soft creamy feel of the mousse and the long lingering palate feel showing sweetcake and creamy apple richness mid-palate flows to a long lingering finish (another Grand Cru at this price!) ..... what's not to like?
",Chardonnay
"It is hard to choose a favorite Launois wine.  All of them are so good.  What makes the Quartz stand out, other than it being unique in that it has few ATM's of pressure in the bottle, is the brightness of the fruit.  There is a dazzling purity that make you want more and more!  The mousse is soft and you couldn't guess that there is less pressure, and the finish is terrific.  Grab some while we still have it!
",Chardonnay
"The NV Launois “Quartz” is a half-pressure (three atmospheres of pressure versus the typical six) bottling in the cremant style. It is at once both delicate and mouthfilling. Composed of 100% chardonnay from the world-renowned chardonnay producing area of Mesnil (and Aviz and Oger), it has flavors of apples, brioche and lemon zest. Loads of cream and vanilla at the back of the palate make this a great way to start a meal with light appetizers.
",Chardonnay
"A perfect introduction to white Burgundy and one of my favorite Direct Imports, the Pouilly Fuisse from Domaine Renaud is kept fresh by utilizing stainless steel for the wines maturation and fermentation.  Notes of yellow plum and citrus are complemented by crisp acidity and fresh mineral notes.  Wonderful as a party wine or with white meats such as turkey and chicken.
",Chardonnay
"This was rather a pleasant surprise for me! In the past wines of Renaud from Pouilly-Fuisse were rich and on the heavier side. But this 2016 vintage is totally different. wine still has lovely weight of the fruit but there is no pronounced oak and texture is bright and fresh with crisp acidity that sparkles from start to finish. Such a delight!
",Chardonnay
"All the Chardonnay that comprises En Tirage is sourced from Beckstoffer Las Amigas Vineyard in Carneros, which is renowned for producing concentrated fruit with bright acidity. This Method Traditionelle sparkling spends seven years on the lees, which imparts a creamy richness and complexity, and the Extra Brut finish ensures the quality of the vineyard shines through. Delicate white florals and a subtle hint of custard lead to a dry, yet creamy palate with a very long finish.
",Chardonnay
"This is a very easy to like Chardonnay. The nose is fresh and inviting. In the mouth it is juicy with nice bright California fruit but it is not over ripe and there are no oak flavors. The Farm Worker Chardonnay is clean and delicious and will go well with chicken or fish.
",Chardonnay
"Fans of the richer, more oak-driven styles of California Chardonnay will enjoy this example from Maldonado quite nicely. Aromas of pineapple upside down cake, apple pie, green fig, and lemon zest play with oak driven characteristics of cedar and burnt sugar. Round texture on the palate, but pleasantly fresh and lively additionally. Poached pear, white nectarine, and yellow apple flavors are complimented by vanilla and baking spices. A fantastic price point as well; rare to see a Napa Valley Chardonnay for under $18
",Chardonnay
"If it’s true that the best wines are made in the vineyard, this 2014 Maldonado ""Farm Worker"" Napa Valley Chardonnay couldn’t hope for a better pedigree. Lupe Maldonado has over three decades of vineyard management experience under his belt, and it shows. Fermented partially in stainless steel and partially in French oak, this is a crisp, focused effort that nevertheless offers plenty of ripe, sweet fruit.
",Chardonnay
"The Maldonado Farm Worker Chardonnay is a focused and crisp expression of the varietal, fermented in steel, with the intensity of  Napa Valley fruit. With no oak to get in the way of this beautiful fruit, the wine is light, mineral-driven and with refreshing acidity. Farm Worker is a perfect Chardonnay for those who are looking for an easy-drinking wine for light appetizers, or an extended brunch on a lazy summer day.
",Chardonnay
"This is the ""quintessential California"" profile that so many Chardonnay drinkers prefer, but at under $18 and in a truly well-made style! It has the ""buttery"" profile, but with nice acidity to keep it from crossing into the ""too heavy"" territory; oak integration that doesn't overwhelm, and the classic tropical fruit notes that shine, all working in a well-balanced harmony. A true crowd-pleaser for your next cocktail hour event!
",Chardonnay
"Farm worker is ideal for Rombauer drinkers on a budget. It has the bold, buttery notes of Rombauer mixed with juicy Napa fruit. Great price point for a Napa Valley Chardonnay- don't miss out!
",Chardonnay
"This is the wine Rombauer doesn't want you to know about!!!  Rich, lush with elegant Napa fruit, a soft acidic edge, and the perfect dose of oak to make it EXTREMELY easy drinking.  If Napa Chardonnay is your jam, you can't miss this level of quality for the price.
",Chardonnay
"This was surprisingly good Chardonnay from our friends at Maldonado Vineyards. Great richness, lively and energetic. With great richness and follow through, this would be a close match to Rombauer or a Frank Family-styled CA Chardonnays. This is a very well-made wine for the price point. Enjoy!
",Chardonnay
"This Napa Chardonnay is a lovely, solid offering meant to be an everyday drinker for the vineyard workers of Maldonado Winery. Lupe Maldonado came from Mexico and worked for Sterling Vineyards before going to work for Peter Newton, where he spend 30 years overseeing the vineyards for Newton. This wine is a celebration of his hard work and memories of long days. Juicy fruit and buttered toast are immediately present on the nose and create a wonderful weight on the palate. Hints of lemon, brioche, and kiwi are balanced by oak, allowing just the right amount of tannin on the finish. Overall, this was an exceptionally well-balanced wine, and at a fantastic price for a Napa Chardonnay.
",Chardonnay
"I have poured this wine for several dinner parties now and it is always a hit!  The soils of the Jura are mostly marl and limestone sharing a lot in common with Champagne.  This cuvee of Chardonnay and Pinot really explodes on the nose with the essence of spiced pear fruit, candied ginger and biscuity dough.  Tight mousse and crisp acidity keep this lively and refreshing on the palate.  The ""Sauvage"" makes an exquisite aperitif but I find it just as enjoyable with food.  One of my favorite cocktail party starters is a spiced miso dip with crudites.  This goes perfectly!
",Chardonnay
"This is soooooo good. Super clean. Excellent balance. Magic Price.
",Chardonnay
"$15 California Chardonnay is not normally in my Drinking Playbook, but I do get to taste an awful lot of them so I think I have an idea of when something is as good as this wine is shows up that you should know about it. The nose has life, it's refreshing, fresh fruit, not condensed or tropical just real. On the palate the wine has weight, a supple roundness yet not fat, it's balanced, long and has a lift in the finish. Excellent value for the Price Point!
",Chardonnay
"The 2015 No Curfew Chardonnay is a perfect wine for those who crave a dry, full-bodied Chardonnay with an abundance of tropical and citrus fruit on the palate, and a kiss of butter. This wine is clean and refreshing, with stony minerality. The No Curfew Chardonnay is undoubtedly one of the best values in California, and competes with wines three times the price!
",Chardonnay
"It was only a few months ago that I had my first sip of Hanzell Chardonnay and it was outstanding! Not too long after I decided to visit their winery and was able to taste their Sabella wines which are sourced from younger vines on the estate. I was blown away again. It is an excellent and expressive crisp-style chardonnay. Partial use of neutral oak and stainless gives a wonderful medium bodied texture while leaving  the wine vibrant and fresh with note of pink and yellow citrus. A friendly price point at under $25, you won't be disappointed in the quality from one the oldest estate wineries in Sonoma County.
",Chardonnay
"It's not often that we find cross over wines in New Zealand for California Chard drinkers. That said this is not Rombauer of the Southern Hemisphere, but it is very much in an internationally appealing style. Deep notes of creamy butter, subtle nuttiness, stone fruit and baked Golden Delicious. The nose is so heady and rich that you expect to be inundated with ripeness and oak on the palate, but instead you get a wonderful zesty lemon paired with a great texture and some tropical fruit notes. Wonderful balance, for this textured expressive style.
",Chardonnay
"Domaine Eden historically produces some of California's finest wines, with little to no manipulation or fining. The 2013 Chardonnay is medium-bodied with a rich texture and condensed, focused flavor. Aged in French oak. Aromas of fresh pineapple and caramel entice, and the palate, though rich, is cut with a wet quartz minerality and a lovely earthy quality, and bright acidity creates a clean impression and balance. This is a truly exceptional value for California Chardonnay connoisseurs.
",Chardonnay
"One of my personal favorite wineries in California is Mount Eden. It is a truly special vineyard and the folks behind the scenes couldn’t be more dedicated to their craft and to the quality of the wines if they wanted to be. For decades Mount Eden has made some of the best Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Cabernet Sauvignon all from the same vineyard-is there another vineyard anywhere in the world that pulls this off?-all for supremely reasonable prices. So a few years back I was even more excited when they told me they were going to make a new sister wine called Domaine Eden and bottle all 3 varietals they have become known for. This took place in about 2007, right around the time that they purchased a second, noncontiguous estate just a few minutes down the road. This old estate was fully planted with some top notch, mature vines and had a reputation in its own right as the old Cinnabar Estate Vineyard. 10+ years later the Domaine Eden label has become known at K&L for incredibly serious wines for amazing values, in fact a big secret is that quite often a big amount of the original Mount Eden Estate fruit makes it into these bottlings. The 2013 Domaine Eden Chardonnay is flat out stunning and probably the best young Domaine Eden Chardonnay I’ve ever tasted. The pretty nose is layered impeccably with notes of vanilla, caramel, grilled white corn and edges of honeysuckle brightness. Lifting and vibrant there is a fun interplay between the zesty tangerine and Clementine high tones and the more rich, dense flavors of toasted brioche, drop biscuits and a continuation of the vanilla found in the nose. Slick and fleshy this is about as good as it gets for Chardonnay under $30 and is a testament to just how great a job the team at Domaine/Mount Eden does with Chardonnay.
",Chardonnay
"Holy Moly! Are we actually sending out an e-mail about the always asked about and rarely in stock Kistler? We sure are! Over the last couple of years Kistler has begun releasing one wine to the broad market, and even then only to a select few customers. That wine is the 2015 Kistler Sonoma Mountain Chardonnay; all the other wines are still mailing list only. This Chardonnay shows why so many people have clamored after these wines for so long. With an impeccable balance of richness and structure that is rarely found in California Chardonnay this wine shows off expressive aromas of dried apricots, fried polenta and vanilla custard in the nose to add depth to the higher toned persimmon and wet stone notes. Sinewy and powerful but with an airy frame this wine may be a bit more energetic than some remember the brand. With resonating citrus oil, brioche, a hint of pan fried popcorn and a return of apricot found on the nose this is one energetic and fresh Chardonnay that does carry some broadness as it unfurls on the palate. While this may be a bit “fresher” than some remember it back in the 90’s through the mid-00’s it is still full of class, precision and charm.
",Chardonnay
"The 2015 Kistler Sonoma Mountain Chardonnay is everything you could want in a classic Cali Chard. Intense tropical and citrus notes along with a judicious amount of caramelized toast and brioche are matched on the palate with a full body, and glycerol creaminess. And just when you think this wine is about to go over the top, the bright, zippy acidity from the Sonoma Mountain AVA keeps it in check and creates a complete and balanced crowd-pleaser Chardonnay.
",Chardonnay
"These wines always change my view when it comes to high-tier domestic whites.  Many expressions of Chardonnay at this price point are overblown and heavy, indicating that I am subsidizing the estate's new barrel program rather than paying for a well-made, balanced Chardonnay.  I trust Kistler with my money and you should too.  These wines are worth every penny and it's clear that the price point is reflective of the quality of the wine and the people behind the production.  Arguably the best producer of white wines in California. Period.
",Chardonnay
"The wonderful '15 Kistler Sonoma Mountain lives up to every expectation. A big nose of ripe tropical fruit, well integrated toasty oak, and decadent vanilla cream. The powerful nose makes you expect a total monster on the palate and it is REALLY rich, but there's this lovely lemony zesty side that reminds us, yes indeed this is Chardonnay. Really the total package from the highest quality Sonoma Mountain Chard producer.
",Chardonnay
"Kistler's 2015 Sonoma Mountain Chardonnay was the first Kistler wine I have tasted and I can see why it is so popular. Elegant and balanced, this wine offers all you'd want in a California Chardonnay. The fresh citrus and tropical fruit combined with luscious richness, toasty oak and bright acid come together to make a tasty well-rounded Chardonnay.
",Chardonnay
"Kistler wines are synonymous with high quality wine. This is one of Sonoma's premier wineries and I am proud we carry this Chardonnay. Sourced from the family's mountain vineyards, this wine delivers a unique Burgundian style. Juicy lemon and honey are well integrated with a rich creamy, almost meringue texture. A long clean finish polishes off this outstanding wine. I highly recommend this to anyone who is a Chardonnay lover!
",Chardonnay
"This is the perfect entry into one of the most recognizable Chardonnay producers of California, giving you a lovely overview of why Kistler is so highly rated. Made from a cuvee of all of the terroir Kistler works with, this is the overview wine that allows people to glimpse what this winery has to offer. Rich fruit on the nose gives a hint to the power and focus of this wine. Lots of stone fruit, with little hints of tropical lushness and wet rock are carried forward on a core of acid the leads to a long finish. Well balanced and very clean despite being a big wine in some ways.
",Chardonnay
"Champagne is always a welcome choice and not just for special occasions, but when you open a bottle of single village Grand Cru Champagne that is an occasion all unto itself.  Mesnil sur Oger is a quant hamlet in southern half of the Cote du Blanc with many famous parcels, and the Launois family captures that specific essence perfectly.  The toasty, brioche nose opens up quickly to reveal yellow fig, Golden Delicious apple, fields of jasmine, a walnut nuttiness and then you find the hints of chalk you were looking for.  On the palate the apple gets firmer and a little more Granny Smith, pear and white pepper can be found, and the chalk is easily detected.  The wine has firm acidity but leaves plenty of room to experience the softer elements.
",Chardonnay
"This is the ""insiders"" Launois, and most of what we can get sells very quickly to people who have visited the property in Mesnil. This comes from the tops and bottoms of the slopes in the grand crus of Mesnil, Cramant and Oger, and is aged for an extra year compared to the reserve. This has classic chalky drive and length, with more than a little complexity. Don't get hooked- we never get much and it always goes fast!
",Chardonnay
"Hello, my pretty! That's because this is just what this champagne is, very, very pretty. Loads of cream, with muted citrus fruits and white stone fruits. Hints of orange and blood orange. We do not get very much of this from Launois, so don't wait to buy it. In fact, NEVER wait to buy any Launois because it comes and goes so quickly. Sell a kidney and buy some!

"The Veuve Clemence is the older, richer brother to the Cuvee Reserve from Launois. With four years on the lees, it is my go to bottle when  in the mood for a fuller bodied Champagne. Full of toasty brioche and biscuit dough right out of the glass, hinting at the opulent nature to come. On the palate it evolves into a supple and appealing wine, chalk full of Grand Cru Chardonnay minerality and stone fruit.
",Chardonnay
"This is gorgeously lush wine made from hillside grapes and the top and bottom of the slopes. The nose is yeasty and voluptuous with a richness on the palate that maintains its elegance under the weight. Truly a fine wine.
",Chardonnay
"Another Launois that simply drinks far too easily. This cuvee showcases the crispness and cleanliness that I love in Launois' Champagne while also offering length and drive. Light notes of apple and melon layer the minerality of this wine and help it to disappear far too quickly.
",Chardonnay
"I love the freshness of the Veuve Clemence.  From pickings on the upper and lower parts of the slopes in all Grand Cru vineyards.  The Champagne is wonderfully complex, but the crisp apple fruit component of the palate shows through brilliantly and subtle hints of spices are woven throughout.  Another incredible deal in Grand Cru Champagne
",Chardonnay
"Rickshaw sources their grapes for this Chardonnay from Santa Barbara all the way up to Mendocino.  Blending fruit from warmer weather regions along with fruit from cooler climates gives the wine a lovely balance of richness along with structure and aromatics.  It's got citrusy, tropical brightness along with a vanilla and toast undertone from the partial barrel fermentation (20%) and 6 months in French oak.  A killer wine for an amazing price, this would please anyone looking for a fresh, fruit forward wine with some texture and structure.
",Chardonnay
"Whatever camp you are in California or France, when it comes to Chardonays, the Au Bon Climat delivers a sublime bottle of Chardonnay, delighting with that rare combination of vanilla, crisp apple and toffee.  The combination of great weight on the palate with citrus and pineapple,provides a high degree of gratification joining with that really nice pop of acidity and mineral which keeps your mouth zinging as it asks for more.  With that spike of tartness and dry finish it would be a quintessential pairing for oyster stuffing. Look forward to bringingthat sublime satisfaction to the dinner table.
",Chardonnay
"This rich, full bodied white Burgundy from Chateau Vitallis impressed me even next to much more expensive offerings at today's staff tasting. It is stuffed with great Chardonnay flavor, but does not crossover into heaviness. It is certainly one of the very best Pouilly Fuisse's we have in stock.
",Chardonnay
"An icon in Australian Chardonnay. The 2015 Vasse Felix ""Premier"" Chardonnay (not to be confused with the lower tier ""Filius"" Chardonnay) is the culmination of many decades of vineyard development, vine age and rock star winemaker Virginia Willcock's endless pursuit of Chardonnay perfection. This wine is both beautifully representative of classic Margaret River chardonnay but also a stunningly refined example of Virginia's inimitable wine making  style. Baked pear, toasted barley, some slightly tart peach notes and plenty of signature stony minerals. Whisps of struck match, and split white oak. Such a complex wine but so quaffable and refreshing at the same time. Concentrated and flavorful but brisk and lively. Exceptionally good Chardonnay especially at our too low to show pricing.
",Chardonnay
"Vasse Felix’s Premier class of wines are known for their harmony and precision.  The 2015 chardonnay is a reminder of how the cold influence of an ocean on the hilly coast of a western shore can provide consistently beautiful, balanced and refined wines.  The vibrant lemon blossom and ripe white peach notes in the glass start a parade of an ever evolving nose that moves to jasmine and hints tight grained French oak.  On the palate the summer peach holds on tight with a racy acidity refreshing the palate and revealing the citrus notes and savory finish.
",Chardonnay
"My favorite pick for early fall, this wine begins with a soothing aroma of vanilla and lemon curd and shows lively acidity and good structure. The texture is creamy with notes of both yellow apple and citrus. The finish is classic, rich and persistent. I can’t imagine a better value Chassagne-Montrachet on the shelf. Highly recommended!
",Chardonnay
"This is a great representation of Sonoma Coast Chardonnay fruit from the cool coastal influence and great growing season. Not overly rich or buttery, this elegant Chardonnay shows flavors of citrus fruits, white flowers and hazelnuts with salinity and minerality creating fantastic balance. There is no wonder why this is a domestic customer favorite year after year!
",Chardonnay
"You have to take note when a premium winery like Flowers releases a biodynamic/organic Chardonnay from my favorite appellation for the varietal, Sonoma Coast.  This is a beautiful wine that is at once creamy and toasty, refreshing, and full of secondary flavors of spices like clove and cinnamon from 11 months in 35% new French oak.  Have this gem with some roasted chicken and fennel.
",Chardonnay
"The Flowers Sonoma Coast Chardonnay is a polished and refined wine, made from high quality, cool climate fruit from the Fort Ross-Seaview area. The wine is a light, golden color which is the first indicator of it's subtle finesse, with aromas of delicate yellow flowers and wet rock, lemon peel and raw honey. The palate is light to medium bodied, but coats the mouth nicely, with just the slightest hint of freshly churned butter. This said, the wine has a very clean finish, with minerality that won't quit.
",Chardonnay
"With how popular the Chardonnay from Flowers already is it still boggles my mind that it isn’t even more popular. I’ve used this wine for a few years now as one of the quintessential Chardonnays of the US. It rides a lovely middle line without sacrificing flavor, complexity or quality and is never “dumbed down” to be so likeable across so many different palates. The 2015 shows the intensity and concentration of the vintage while never losing the house style of framing pure varietal Chardonnay flavors of honeyed pear and nectarine under a nose of raw cashews and shelled pecans and the sea foam/briny highlights of the far Sonoma Coast. This wine is truly a standard bearer in the world of Chardonnay.
",Chardonnay
"Flowers has recently shifted towards a more finesse-driven style and frankly, it's relieving.  Not to say that I wasn't a fan before this, but there is no shortage of big, viscous Chardonnays in Sonoma and I've been hoping for something to change.  I was fortunate enough to taste this wine a few weeks ago and was astonished by the length and balance that is possessed -  notes of lemon flesh, white peach, marzipan, cloves and a lovely saline quality on the finish.  Very impressed by the direction of this winery, not to mention they are going to take over the old VML property in Healdsburg, which should be nothing short of awesome!
",Chardonnay
"Our final appointment of this year’s summit was with Taittinger, and the 2006 Taittinger ""Comtes de Champagne"" Brut Blanc de Blancs Champagne was the perfect bottle to perk up tired mouths. I found the limey, Puligny-like drive of this Champagne compelling and refreshing, and was happy to see this vintage living up to the legend of the Comtes de Champagne. This all Cote de Blancs Grand Cru Champagne is sourced from primarily estate vineyards in Avize, Chouilly, Oger and Mesnil. It is 95% fermented in stainless, but sees 5% small oak to add richness. The combination of toast from 8 years on the lees and lime zest from the top Chardonnay make for an exotic, yet elegant beauty of a Champagne.
",Chardonnay
"It was fun to taste this Blanc de Blancs in a lineup with other all-Chardonnay Champagne to experience the richer, creamier expression of the grape. Soft, ripe stone fruit matched with notes of toast and chalk. Despite this showing the richer side of Chardonnay there is still acid present giving this wine length and finish and hinting at how well this wine will age.
",Chardonnay
"This quite rich new release from Taittinger is a very worthy follow up to the 2005. It has a lovely white stone fruit character with lightly toasted nuttiness and subdued apple flavors. Creamy and floral, with a nice bit of citrus fruit on the finish.
",Chardonnay
"Aromas of spiced pear, lemon curd, and toast waft from the glass. On the palate, this is a round and creamy champagne expressing notes of baked stone fruit, citrus, chalk, and biscuit. The lengthy, mineral finish alone is worth the price of admission. Drink now or hold.
",Chardonnay
"Aromas of yellow apples, caramelized pears and toast are very expressive immediately after popping the bottle. The palate shows more white nectarine and peach with bright acidity, soft moussey bubbles and a long, rich finish of baked apples.
",Chardonnay
"Peach on the nose plus toasty oak with a caramel nuttiness tempered by minerality and a lovely shock of acidity. Chalky soil is evident here but there's a deep richness on the palate that powers through the lingering finish. ""Comtes de Champagne"" is an investment that will not only impress but with the Taittinger name and 2006 vintage, but keep everyone happy in the glass - both now and with age.
",Chardonnay
"The 2006 vintage of Taittinger's flagship ""Comtes de Champagne"" is a fabulous wine coming from a top-notch vintage. It has all the rich, creamy character that has come to define this bottling, showing ripe, white peach, raw honey, hazelnut, and buttercream on the nose. But this vintage yielded quite a lot of mineral flavor across the region, helping to provide focus among some of the more decadent flavors. Chalky minerals and laser-like acidity incorporate to give the impression of a gravity-defying tight-rope walk between acid and fruit, mineral and oak, complexity and purity. The length is surprising with its lingering notes of fig and apricot, providing an extremely pleasurable finish. Excellent.
",Chardonnay
"One of the true pleasures of our profession is the opportunity to taste extraordinary wines. Today afforded us just that. The 2006 Comtes de Champagne from Taittinger arrived and we were smitten. It offers an impressive combination of richness and freshness  along with certain longevity. A mélange of captivating green apple and citrus aromas and a sumptuous and seamless palate make this wonderful today yet are only hints of its underlying complexity. Definitely one of the best value tete de cuvees made that is certain to reward with refinement.
",Chardonnay
"I believe one of the very few aspects of this wine business that still captivates me is that there are a handful of domestic producers that make exceptional wine each year, but, for whatever reason, never seem to promote themselves via the national/international wine critics who give high ratings and rankings. You see this with Navarro Vineyards in the Anderson Valley, Dehlinger in the Russian River Valley, Fort Ross in the Sonoma Coast region, and Gainey Vineyard in the Santa Rita Hills area of the Central Coast. The Gaineys have been making excellent varietals, particularly Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, for over forty years and yet very little press is released about their wines. This lovely Chardonnay is an excellent example of what I am asserting here. Distinctive aromas of cinnamon apple to tropical fruit abound in the nose that is underscored by a pronounced vanillan, creamy note. Rich in the mouth, yet not overdone, this Gem is well-structured, lush, yet balanced and offers a pure Central Coast spiced Chardonnay presentation. The Bean has demanded that I bring home at least a case of this Chardonnay Gem for our enjoyment over the next several years. A FANTASTIC VALUE!!!  ***** 13.9% ABV *****
",Chardonnay
"Gainey is a family owned and run winery that had their first vines planted back in 1984. This wine is 100% Chardonnay with all estate fruit - 61% from Gainey's Rancho Esperanza and 39% from Gainey's Evan's Ranch. What I love most about this Chardonnay is its combination of bright acidity and roundness on the palate without being overly rich. Stone fruits and citrus flavors dominate with subtle oak character and a clean refreshing finish. It's price point is also a huge bonus!
",Chardonnay
"The 2014 Gainey Santa Rta. Hills Chardonnay may be the perfect summer bottle. Brisk, refreshing and thirst quenching this wine is shockingly good for its price tag. Whether you are BBQ’ing, poolside or just relaxing wherever you like to chill out this Chard will be friendly and help you get to where you want to be. Aromas of nectarine and apricot add richness to the lively nose that also shows notes of citrus and subtle oak. Picking up some pectic weight on entry this rolls along with fleshy fruit flavors dominating the intense, rounded palate. Think grilled peaches, kumquat, Bosq pear flesh and a hint of bergamot backed by a complex interwoven green tea and earthen spice. This is a fastball right down the middle of the Chardonnay plate, crushable!
",Chardonnay
"Aromatic nose consisting of bright citrus, ripe orchard fruit, and upfront oak notes (baking spices especially). White peach, lemon & lime, golden apple, and crisp minerality dominate on the palate. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy, but noted with an elevated acidity that leaves a refreshing finish on the palate.  Drink over the next 2-3 years. One of our best values in domestic chardonnay for under $20!
",Chardonnay
"Outstanding value California Chard for 17.99! Bright fruited and acidic, this bottling also delivers on well-integrated oak to satisfy the craving. Multi-dimensional and fun, this is a great quality wine for the budget.
",Chardonnay
"I often find in that budget-friendly, $20-and-under price range for a Cali Chardonnay, you either get a monstrous oak bomb full of wood chips that leave splinters in your mouth or you end up drinking a super steely, metallic acid bomb that strips the enamel off your teeth. That is why I love this Gainey Chardonnay. It is surprisingly refreshing and clean for a medium-to-full-bodied Chardonnay. It also has an elegant and integrated toasted, creme brulée oakiness that nicely balances the lifted white peach, ripe apple and soft Meyer lemon flavors on the palate.
",Chardonnay
"The Gainey Estate vineyards are located just ten miles East of the Pacific Ocean, and this Chardonnay is a blend of two of those vineyards: Rancho Esperanza and Evan's Ranch. These two vineyards produce fruit of differing characteristics, and the result is a harmonious combination of fruit, acid and minerality. Notes of bright ripe pineapple, meyer lemon and white peach dance on the medium bodied palate, and a trail of saline minerality creates a lasting finish.
",Chardonnay
"After recently trying this at a staff tasting, I felt compelled to share my thoughts on this outstanding Chardonnay. On the nose, rich vanilla bean and freshly cut lumber  first welcome you. The palate is full of asian pear, light lemon, and fresh acid. A lighter bodied Chardonnay that has some nice minerality and a long beautiful finish. This is a lot of wine for less than twenty dollars, incredible value!
",Chardonnay
"The freshness of the 15 Burgundy whites is the most surprising part of the ripe vintage. Exhibit A is this lovely Bourgogne blanc from Pernot Belicard, brimming with fresh stonefruits on the nose, and a soft acidity that accents the medium bodied weight and fleshiness. Give this to someone who loves central coast wines from California and watch their eyes light up!
",Chardonnay
"Gorgeous orchard fruits, hazelnut and spice notes deftly rise from the glass while on the palate this fruit-driven, mineral-laced offering is in perfect proportion and harmony. The fruit is pure, with just enough spice and oak to bring it all together. The perfect cross-over white that has enough purity to please the French wine lover and enough fruit to please the California wine lover.
",Chardonnay
"Our long standing relationship with Paul Pernod led us to the Pernot Belicard wines in our quest to continually bring in Burgundy that is affordable and ready to drink, The entry level Bourgogne Blanc from Pernot Belicard shows a rich, softly inviting nose with tropical fruit notes. Due to the low acid vintage of 2015 this wine is more open and generous with the fruit, less acid driven and fruitier.
",Chardonnay
"Fig, halved nectarines and subtle white pineapple aromas pop out of the glass bolstered friendly and alluring qualities of oak toast and whole cream. Fleshy and with good heft and smooth edges this may be more crowd pleasing than previous bottlings. We made a concerted effort to add richness and texture in this year’s bottling based on what the 15+ barrels we had to choose from were telling us. Still bright at the edges and with a savor/salinity that is rare for Chardonnay in this price point we this that not only is this a delicious wine but one of outstanding value and exclusivity.
",Chardonnay
"The 2015 Talley K&L Edna Valley Chardonnay is a stunner. Crafted from 1991 plantings at Oliver's Vineyard, known for its cool climate and sand dune soils, the wine reflects the terroir, with a rich palate and slightly briny and prominent minerality. Winemaker Eric Johnson offers us a classic California Chardonnay that is the best of all worlds: buttery and richly fruited, but cut with razor-sharp acidity that keeps the flavors dancing long after the last sip.
",Chardonnay
"Balance was the utmost goal that we (meaning Brick) strive for, and this Chardonnay knocks it out of the ballpark again. From notes of fresh tropical fruit and lemon curd to white flowers and brioche, to an integrated toasty, creme brulée finish (that also happens to be supported by a surprisingly bright acid structure), this Edna Valley Chardonnay is one of the best Chardonnays to come out of the SoCal region!
",Chardonnay
"What I like about this Chardonnay is that if offers nice California richness but is balanced and not dominated by oak flavors.  It is fruity and creamy, and most importantly, easy to enjoy. Try it alone or with chicken and vegetarian cuisine.
",Chardonnay
"Another fantastic vintage of Talley/K&L Chardonnay! Perhaps a little leaner than the last vintage, with very focussed and fresh acidity, the wine still has that creamy, soft fruit that marks the refined Talley style. The blend this year includes one barrel aged in new French oak, to add a nice element of spice and toast, but as a whole the wine remains clean an light in feel.
",Chardonnay
"This neutral/new barrel oaked release from Talley has tropical yellow fruits (pineapple dominates) with a little bit of mango and lemon peel. Pair this with the overall creamy texture and you have a winner.  A very nice balance of citrus and oak kick in on the finish. The oak is very balanced and adds to, rather than takes away form, the very pretty character of this release. Super versatile by itself or with food.
",Chardonnay
"Talley and K&L are back together again with this delicious Edna Valley Chardonnay! With high quality fruit from one of Talley's estate vineyards, this creamy, buttery, full bodied Chardonnay comes to be a great value that is exclusively sold here. California Chardonnay lovers won't be disappointed with this one!
",Chardonnay
"This has value written all over it! Lemon and honey notes are accented with savory herbs. A beautiful walnut skin creaminess helps round out and elevate this wine giving it a full mouthfeel. On the finish, the balanced juicy acid leaves your palate wanting more. This would be great with roasted chicken and creammy cheeses.
",Chardonnay
"Jax is our local winemaker of choice here at K&L with the owners living nearby our Redwood City store and the tasting bar just down the street from our SF store. The wines have always represented top quality for the money, and the Y3 Chardonnay is another example of how Jax is sourcing serious fruit, making serious wine, and turning up the heat on other California producers in this price point with knock-out expressions. The 2015 is a perfect balance between classic CA richness and the fresher, cleaner style foodies tend to look for today. There's a ripeness of fruit, but a clean and refreshing finish. I'm so happy to see these guys taking off because no one deserves it more.
",Chardonnay
"This is a great Napa Chardonnay in the $20 range that falls in the middle of buttery/oaky and crisper styles. 100% Chardonnay aged in concrete tanks with complex flavors of lemon zest, caramel, tropical notes, apple and minerality that's full-bodied but with a lovely freshness. There is a lengthy finish that will keep you going back for more.
",Chardonnay
"This is a real beauty of a Napa Chardonnay, with a lovely bright lemon hue, and a nose reminiscent of buttery brioche and delicate Spring wildflowers. The palate is rich, clean and well balanced, and though it is full bodied, it is not dominated by oak, and notes of light citrus and orange blossom come through with a mineral finish.
",Chardonnay
"The latest Chardonnay offering from Jax Vineyards is everything I expect from Napa Valley. A touch of vanilla on the nose, and a generous helping of apple and stone fruit on the palate. Beautiful fresh acid balanced by a rich mouth feel help add texture and focus, while soft spice and and a long finish complete this really well made wine.
",Chardonnay
"It is exciting to taste another winner from our friends at Jax, who have consistently managed to give us good wine at great pricing. This chardonnay has everything you want from a Napa Chard, big intense tropical fruit notes with oak and weight, but not out of balance. Although this is a big rich wine there is enough acid here to keep it from falling flat and move it forward and brings about a long, lovely finish.
",Chardonnay
"This lively ""Champ Gains"" is precise, delicate and very focused. It combines and balances bright acid withrich  roundness of fruit and finish is clean and long.
",Chardonnay
"This is our most popular half bottle of Champagne by far. The Bonville family has some of the best terroir imaginable for growing Chardonnay: every acre that they own is super chalky, east-facing Grand Cru on the Cote des Blancs. They have been making their own Champagne here since the 1920s, and growing here for many generations before that. This is their entry-level bottling, and what a way to start! It is made of at least half reserve wines, giving it not only the dry, chalky drive that makes this area famous, but also giving the wine toasty, creamy, delicious drinkability. A must try for any Champagne lover.
",Chardonnay
"Stone fruit and Anjou pear flavors are broad and pure on the palate.  Lively acidity on the crisp finish makes the flavors last for a minute.  The fruit is pronounced and very clean, with just a hint of autolytic flavors mingling with the fruit on the back end.  Delicious Blanc de Noirs!
",Chardonnay
"In trying to get my head around the physics behind all those tiny bubbles in a bottle of Champagne l discovered a wonderfully fascinating little book called Uncorked, by Gérard Liger-Belair. Apparently gravity drives the velocity of the bubbles in a flute of Champagne, so the best spot in the solar system to achieve the absolute tiniest bubbles would be on… you guessed it— Jupiter, with about 100 times the gravity of our own sparkling blue orb. Pack your bags, but before you go flying off into space, try a bottle or two of this incredible direct import. Created from superb Pinot Noir cultivated in the renowned Le Riceys terroir near Aube, the “Reserve” harbors a panoply of rich flavors ranging from citrus fruits to fleshy pears, apples, nectarines and beyond, embodying an elegant, creamy mousse and miniscule, dare I suggest, ‘out of this world’ bubbles. Now prepare for takeoff!
",Chardonnay
"Gary has hit the ball out of the park with his latest DI offering! The Lamoureux Reserve Brut is sure to please every palate at the party. Elegantly toasty with notes of ripe pear and apple up front, this cuvee continues its decadent journey with a sumptuously sinful palate loaded with white nectarine and exotic starfruit. Couple this with a ridiculously creamy, full-bodied texture and ultra fine bead and you have a true 5 star Champagne!
",Chardonnay
"What a revelation!  I'm a huge fan our DIs but this new arrival may be one of the best yet.  Layers of fruit erupt from the glass including notes of apple, pear, peach and blood orange.  A hint of the exotic as well including some starfruit, kiwi and a bit of ginger.  On the palate the mousse is creamy with flavors that are generous and keep unfolding.   Bravo!  (A side note - don't miss the STILL rose that they also make.  Truly special!)
",Chardonnay
"Unbelievably drinkable and sophisticated on the palate. 100% Pinot Noir makes this dry cuvee especially luscious and creamy, with ripe stone fruit and subtle creamy brioche on the finish. This is a Champagne I'm really excited about because anyone can enjoy this style of Champagne. From the connoisseur to the bubbly drinking starter, this will seduce and amaze your palates!
",Chardonnay
"What an intensely pretty Champagne!  Peach and blood orange waft from the glass, which makes me think of a spring-time sunset.  The texture is moussey and very playful and carries flavors of white stone fruit and orange blossom.  I'm so happy that this Champagne exists!
",Chardonnay
"I was stunned by the quality of this beautifully crafted Chardonnay.  An intriguing bouquet of saffron, baking spice, lemon meringue and green apples hints at its nuance and complexity.  On the palate, electrifying acidity enhances the aforementioned flavors, and while there is an underlying richness from the oak regimen, the emphasis is on freshness and balance.   Superb craftsmanship.
",Chardonnay
"I still recall the first time I tried a Leeuwin Estate Artist Series Chardonnay.  I was completely astonished at the incredible quality and complexity of the wine.  The 2013 is spectacularly consistent with my original feelings.  Lovely, classy and refined, but not at all lightweight.  The rich body of this wine completely envelops the oak, which feels nutty and creamy.  It has a dense apple fruit tinged with tangerine and lemon peel, that goes on and on - the finish is extremely long and laced with fine minerals.  You would be forgiven for thinking of a modern Burgundy when tasting this wine, but truly it is all Margaret River from start to finish.
",Chardonnay
"The reviews on this wine are phenomenal and for good reason. This Chardonnay from one our our top Aussie producers is energetic and dynamic, while remaining elegant and refined. The price on this Chard is lower than you'll find anywhere else and I will be taking advantage and picking up some of it for gifts and elegant dinner parties. It shows fantastic balance and nuance of flavors, with just a touch of oak and brioche flavors complimenting the stone fruit. Even if you are not familiar with the Leeuwin label, I encourage you to give it a try and don't think you'll be surprised that it stands up to any high end Chardonnay from California or Burgundy.
",Chardonnay
"California Chardonnay sometimes gets a bad rap. And yes there are some pretty appalling examples out there. This wine from BV however takes a classic flavor profile, that has taken the wine world by storm over the last few decades, and delivers a faithful rendition with notable balance and length. It's a rich wine with plenty of tropical fruit, baked apple pie and creamy notes. But there is also a nice saline component, a core of bright acidity, the oak is well judged and not overbearing. This is going to make a lots of classic CA Chardonnay drinkers happy especially at our super sharp pricing.
",Chardonnay
"I feel guilty for consuming too much of our allocation of this wine, but never when I am drinking it! I have had many great bottles of this, and one of the most memorable was not from the K&L allocation, but rather off the wine list at Bistro 7 in Epernay. I was dining alone, and it felt extra special and decadent to order a bottle just for me off of their fairly priced list. It went spectacularly with the rabbit terrine and even better with the seared turbot. The Bonville Prestige has ripe, round white fruit balanced perfectly by old vine top terroir, Avize chalk. This wine has texture to beat most of over $100 bottles of Champagne on our shelves!
",Chardonnay
"When I am feeling like a fancy bottle of Champagne, this is what I reach for. The Prestige lives fully up to the name, rich and opulent, completely gorgeous. A sultry nose of toasted hazelnut and brioche waft up from the nose, followed by a palate filled with richness. Macaroon, butter-cream frosting, layers of baked goods, and a brilliant acidity flesh out a great bottle.
",Chardonnay
"This stunning blanc de blancs has a super, super clean and chalky nose. You can practically smell the fossils in the soil! Meyer lemon notes peek through with just a hint of nectarine and lemon curd. On the palate, it fleshes out beautifully, with baked apples (initially) that finish with Granny Smith apples. This Champagne is unusual in that it has both a tart and full character. It has, of course, Franck Bonville's wonderful quality and balance.
",Chardonnay
"I had this champagne on my birthday and it was the perfect bubbly for the occassion!  Bright and fresh with tons of blanc de blanc fruit, it is also incredibly rich and creamy due to its extended lees contact.  It was the ideal champagne to toast the beginning of the festivities and continued its perfection as it paired beautifully with all the food for the evening.
",Chardonnay
"This was the first champagne I tasted when I started working at K&L and it is still my favorite, when talking bang for your buck. This blanc de blanc will grab anyone's attention with its grace and its beauty. So elegant a palate for so little a price.
",Chardonnay
"The good stuff. This is a fantastic bottle to save for a special dinner; slightly lighter on the fruit profile (think red apples, citrus zest), a mild level of new oak, and a slightly buttery flavor give the juice enough weight and freshness to stand up to almost any meal. Except heavy meats, stews, and BBQ sauce.
",Chardonnay
"For nearly four decades, Shafer has proven time and time again that it's quality over quantity. This Chardonnay is rich, well balanced, and filled with notes of apple, spice, and apricot. This is honestly one of the best quality California Chardonnays I've ever had.
",Chardonnay
"California Chardonnay. Always a polarizing talking point for people who love wine. Shafer ""Red Shoulder Ranch"" Chardonnay is no exception. But, here is my take. What is wrong with a great glass of wine. This Chardonnay is bursting out of the glass with alluring tropical fruit, lemon peel and Asian pear spice. Nothing wrong with that so far right? I know what your thinking, its nothing but oak on the first sip. This Chardonnay hits you with dazzling acidity and a cool smokey minerality. Didn't see that coming did you? Exquisite creamy texture with a touch of baked apple, once again carried through with persistent acidity for a super long finish. What seamless balance in this wine. I long for some Salmon sashimi as I write up this stunning glass of Chardonnay. From California I might add!
",Chardonnay
"Now featuring the new labels! Bonville’s delicate, visually-stunning brut rosé is delicious and elegant, but also substantial: this feels like important Champagne, with quality that far exceeds its price point. Featuring 8% Pinot Noir from celebrated Grand Cru village of Ambonnay, this crisp rosé features vivid red fruit on the nose but finishes fresh, with the linear snap expected of 92% Chardonnay, mostly from the colder 2011 vintage. There is electric acidity on the palate but also a plusher component thanks to a luxuriously fine bead. Luxurious, dry, and easydrinking – this is a favorite rosé for not only celebratory occasions, but to make any day special, and the smaller size is picnic-perfect.
",Chardonnay
"Rose is great to have around in half bottles and this elegant, driven Champagne is my top rose for serving as the aperitif. A colleague of mine once bought a case of this in 750's for his wife, and half of it was consumed the first night at a quite small dinner party... So maybe a half bottle is too small for something this tasty. Cinnamon has one in our fridge at home right now!
",Chardonnay
"Looks can be deceiving, as is the case with the Franck Bonville Rose. One glance at the intense pink color would lead anybody to believe that this rose will be an over the top fruit bomb, but this chardonnay dominant rose is exactly the opposite. With 92% chardonnay, this rose is extremely elegant and fresh. Bright notes of strawberry and cherry are delightfully matched with aromas of ripe lemon and lime and the 8% pinot noir shines through in the creaminess on the palate. The perfect rose to please every palate at the party.
",Chardonnay
"If you lined up every $20 Chardonnay in the store this would knock the socks off of them all.  This is substantial and rich but pure and refined, with slight whiffs of toast and honey before the vibrant, crisp apple flavors spread across your palate.  Hints of citrus blossom and wet mineral coast along the mouthwatering finish begging for another sip.  This is great stuff.
",Chardonnay
"The lovely equipoise and limpid purity of this Chardonnay is revelatory, and, as its name translates as ‘infinite or immeasurable’ I may run out of oxygen to describe it, but I’ll try...in the hands of an excellent winemaker like Severine Bourrier, balance and prismatically clean fruit come to the fore. This Chardonnay is redolent with notes of white peach, Fuji apple, delicate pastry, cut wildflowers and summer hay, and will pair well with grilled scallops or a rosemary-roasted chicken. An extraordinary wine for a fraction of the price you’d pay for a comparable domestic Chardonnay or white Burgundy!
",Chardonnay
"This is a great choice for California Chardonnay lovers who want to try something new or more Old World palates who want something different. The wine is more on the rich side with lots of banana notes on the nose. Not buttery or oaky flavors, however, and the key word here is balance. The structure of the wine match it's tropical aromatics perfectly. Drink it with a seafood covered pasta in butter sauce and watch it truly open up!
",Chardonnay
"This barrel fermented Champagne always satisfies me when I want Champagne that is rich and complex. I love the grand scale of the Grand Cellier, a trait that Vilmart always delivers. I need to drink more of this!

"This a beautiful Chardonnay full of bright lemon, macadamia nuts and a touch of melon. The acid is perfectly balanced and offers up loads of freshness. A long lasting finish, offers fresh stone fruit and wonderful minerality.

"This is a wonderful Chardonnay from the Kumeu River region of South Africa, in a light, Burgundian style. The wine is definitely mineral driven, but is characterized by a creamy and soft texture. The Kumeu River ""Hunting Hill"" is created from grapes grown on the single vineyard site, which was planted in 1982 on a slope with clay soils. Hunting Hill's proximity to the Tasman sea offers a temperate and cool climate for Chardonnay maturation, and the result is elegant and flavorful.

"Chateau Vitallis continues to shine with another great vintage in 2016! This bottling of their entry level white is light, fun, flexible and complex. With a lovely nose of honeysuckle and papaya, delicate orchard fruit on the palate, and crisp, refreshing acidity, the wine is built to complement food. It's easy to pair this with anything from seafood to poultry to cured meats.
",Chardonnay
"I always have to order extra of these magnums - Clyde & Trey always gobble up about half of what we get! All Champagne has an advantage in magnum, seeing more surface area for lees contact and half the amount of air exposure. The Bonville family doubles down by giving these an extra 2-4 years of ageing! This is one of K&L's best selling Champagnes for a very good reason. The Bonville family has some of the best terroir imaginable for growing Chardonnay- every acre that they own is super chalky, east facing Grand Cru on the Cote des Blancs. They have been making their own Champagne here since the 1920's, and growing here for many generations before that. This is their entry level bottling, and what a way to start! It is made of at least half reserve wines, giving it not only the dry, chalky drive that makes this area famous, but also giving the wine toasty, creamy, delicious drinkability. A must try for any Champagne lover. Already exceptional out of 750, the Bonville Selection picks up both richness and zip in the larger format bottle - making it the ""smallest"" big bottle that we have. It ends up empty far too soon!
",Chardonnay
"This is my #1 Champagne magnum of choice for any special occassion. The Frank Bonville is excellent tasting and a crowd pleaser. And I always seem to make alot of friends right away as soon as I walk into a restaurant holding this bottle...
",Chardonnay
"Very impressive Pinot dominant blend at a great price.  The fruit comes mostly from the famous Montagne de Reims, where Pinot reigns supreme.  It has beautiful, soft red fruit like cherries, strawberries, blood orange and marmalade that mingle perfectly with the toasty yeast.  The fruit pops with vibrant acidity and the rich texture keeps you reaching for more.
",Chardonnay
"For several decades Jermann has distinguished itself as one of the very top wineries within Italy's Friuli region and their 2014 Chardonnay reminded us why. Regardless of the challenges of a difficult vintage, they managed to craft a very impressive line-up of wines including this one. It's round and creamy with pronounced granny smith apple and pear flavors enlivened by substantial acidity. This is a tremendous Chardonnay value that will enhance a wide range of dishes including fish, poultry, vegetables and soups.
",Chardonnay
"The nose is full of spiced apple with glints of fresh quince and dried white flowers. On the palate the wine has richness; it’s supple, smooth yet has great balance with a good acidic backbone, fresh enough for those who like it crisp and rich enough for those looking for a cocktail wine. The flavors carry forward that rich apple character and add a leesy, brioche like complexity. Long, full, rich and balanced this is a superb Chardonnay for the price.
",Chardonnay
"Domaine Serene makes one of my favorite Chardonnays from Oregon, and their 2015 really delivers. Bright citrus, brioche and honey aromas jump from the glass while the palate has melon, lemon and cedar notes. Spent a little over a year in 40% new French oak, but this wine remains incredibly balanced from its crisp acidity. This is a serious Chardonnay that is well worth its price.
",Chardonnay
"This little wine has a lot to offer! With the warmer vintage in 2015, village level Chablis has shown outstanding quality, and Domaine Laroche's ""St. Martin"" is one of my favorites of the vintage. This wine is fuller and more robust than your typical Chablis, and has all the structure to age for a few years. It has a character similar to one of the lesser Grand Crus, or a top-tier premier cru, such as Montee de Tonnerre, with poised acidity, full fruit and generous minerality.  At this price, I'm tempted to ""case up"" as we say...
",Chardonnay
"Tasting this next to the Domaine Eden Santa Cruz Mountains Chardonnay was a real eye-opener because while the Eden had the richness and the weight, the Mindego Ridge had all that creaminess, but with vibrant acidity, accents of savory herbs, and minerality in one helluva complex ride from start to finish. It's everything I wish more California Chardonnays could be: full-boded and lush, but without ever sacrificing freshness or secondary flavor. This is a home run of a wine and I'm definitely putting Mindego Ridge on my shortlist of wineries to watch.
",Chardonnay
"I love how both of the 2014 offerings from Mindego Ridge offer up a perfect synthesis of varietal and place. This wine is hand-picked from the estate's tiny 1.3 acre planting of Chardonnay. The wine expresses beautiful ripeness with golden orchard and stone fruit charters. A supple, soft texture on the palate, the wine is rich and mouth-filling. Into the finish the wines' cool climate Santa Cruz Mountain aspect shines through with beautiful focus, glistening saline minerality and lovely line and length. The oak handling is very subtle and alcohol perfect balanced at 13.7%. A stunning, pristine wine that perfect illustrates how special the Santa Cruz Mountains are.
",Chardonnay
"This Chardonnay has a well balanced oak influence that lends the wine just a hint of woodsy spices, creaminess, and a touch cinnamon and cloves. The oak is never intrusive, and is in perfect harmony with the elegant minerality and fruit. A style of Chardonnay that’s clearly aimed towards elegance and balance.
",Chardonnay
"The best word to describe the Amici Chardonnay is balanced. The pure and generous aromatics of stone and tropical fruit lead us into notes of toasted oak and a hint of vanilla. The grapefruit flavors keeps the palate lively while the medium-bodied wine is refreshing and luxurious at the same time. To me, this is one of the best dinner party Chardonnays. It can please those who enjoy richer wines without overwhelming those who enjoy lighter, more sprightly wines. Either way, this Sonoma Coast Chard is tasty.
",Chardonnay
"Wow! I never thought that I would be writing up a domestic chardonnay. That being said, this Amici chardonnay bridges that gap between oaky/buttery (not my favorite) and lean/chalky (my favorite).  It starts with riper fruit, white stone fruits and apples, and moves into light toast and oak and finishes with some really nice acidity and a touch of chalkiness. Really, really nice!
",Chardonnay
"A Sonoma beauty.  Cool apple, pear fruit notes with a hint of pastry, vanilla and spice.  Full on the palate with nice rounded texture that is balance with good acidity. With flavors that range from apple turnover to lemon bars, my mouth is watering just thinking about this wine.
",Chardonnay
"This is a great, entry level white Burgundy that is appropriate both for those who are seeking to switch over from CA chardonnay and for those who appreciate good, affordable white Burgundy. At first classically clean, with bright minerality but, it fleshes out mid-palate with white stone fruits and a hint of green apple. Clean, lingering finish. Lovely.
",Chardonnay
"Black Kite is a new winery to me, and this Chardonnay from Soberanes Vineyard impressed me. The nose is very expressive with lemon creme, yellow apple, vanilla and oak. The palate surprised me by showing lots of freshness and vibrant acidity creating a balanced, medium to full-body Chardonnay. This is a great California find if you're wanting something new.
",Chardonnay
"Crafted from Wente clone Chardonnay grown in the sandy soils of Soberanes Vineyard, this beauty is fruit forward, full bodied and powerful. True to the inherent characteristics of It's fruit source, the wine shows tropical aromas and flavors of ripe mango, fresh pineapple and lemon peel. This is one Chardonnay that has the focus and intensity to pair with richer dishes, but the versatility and flavorful charm to quaff on It's own.
",Chardonnay
"The Black Kite Soberanes Vineyard is just that. A big wine, for big Chard fans but there is a twist. While most “big” Chards come more from winemaking in the cellar than anything else this wine gets its largesse from the vineyard itself. The Soberanes Vineyard is a superstar in the making, after all it is jointly owned and farmed by the two biggest names in the area-The Pisoni and Franscioni families-and still is growing out of its youthful power. With about 40% new oak and full malolactic fermentation this certainly has a frame of a certain ilk but the fruit, the raw materials, of this wine override it with splendid fig, baked apple, pistachio ice cream and hints of lavender. Never losing its granitic minerality this wine has a counterbalance to all that size and that is really what keeps this from going too overboard.
",Chardonnay
"""Let's get tropical"", to quote the famous Jackie Moon. This Chardonnay is loaded with exotic and tropical fruits. Pineapple, Mango and candied lemon are pronounced on the nose and follow to the palate. This has a tremendously rich  mouth-feel and deliciously juicy acid. Soft wood spice, dried herbs and a touch of menthol help add complexity that lingers on the finish. This would go great with Caribbean style grilled shrimp skewers.
",Chardonnay
"I can't believe this is under $20! Delicious and elegant, this paper-wrapped Champagne is a departure from the searing acid of Blanc de blancs and instead shows golden apple fruit up front, followed by toastiness and a luxurious mouthfeel. Though there is a crisp backbone of minerality from the fossil-rich soil, this is a slightly unusual offering in that it’s 100% Chardonnay, but with a creamier spin. Paul-Vincent Ariston is committed to making exceptional value Champagne, and there’s no doubt he’s accomplished that here. Aspasie Blanc de blancs is textured and age worthy, but in a smaller, more portable size.
",Chardonnay
"The Ariston family are some of my favorite winemakers who produce some of the best small-estate champagnes that we carry. This blanc de blancs is no exception. It carries their reputation for excellent quality at an affordable price. This is a creamy, rich style of blanc de blancs with a rich mousse and lemon meringue flavors. Fleshy, without being heavy, it has a long, subtle finish of apple and pear fruit. A great way to start a party or meal!
",Chardonnay
"A great wine from Champagne under $40?! I was shocked not only at the price, but the wine inside the bottle is really great stuff. It is a perfect sparkling wine for entertaining or at your dinner table. The apples/pear fruits on the nose and palate and the expressive nature of this wine makes it appeal to palates almost all the way across the board.
",Chardonnay
"I recently enjoyed this while relaxing in a hot tub on a nice summer evening in California; it was perfect! Fresh and pronounced flavors of pear and apricot combine with a crisp acidity and lush creaminess for a wine fresh and approachable in style. The perfect accompaniment to any moment of leisure, at a price far below its value!
",Chardonnay
"This is textbook Meursault, but with restraint and balance. For those looking to understand the white wine appellations of Burgundy, grab this bottle for a lesson on the richness and weight of a great Meursault. Nutty almond flavors coat the palate on the first sip, but that richness is never cloying or sweet. It's balanced by acidity and an elegance of fruit the holds back the heft. Simply lovely!
",Chardonnay
"Here's a great pick for affordable luxury drinking with this classic expression of Meursault. Aromas of honeysuckle on the nose, this coats the mouth with flavors of  baked pear and stone fruit with a crispy kick of lemon, and light nutty toast.
",Chardonnay
"Stone fruit, crunchy golden raisen and crisp apple form the core of this steely and intense wine.  The Chablis-like finish is palate cleansing and will have you reaching for another glass.
",Chardonnay
"Maison Henri Bouillot Bourgogne Blanc offers an amazingly fresh and surprisingly complex expression. Drinking well-above the price point, this wine has a super fragrant, pretty nose, and shows off  plenty of layered fruit notes of lemon, pear and apple. With mouth-quenching acidity, this is my go-to white this summer. Super recommended!
",Chardonnay
"Wow! This is a fantastic Bourgogne Blanc. I have always loved the wines by Henri Boillot but I was not expecting the 2015 Bourgogne Blanc to be as good as it is. At only $24.99 this may be the best value we currently have in the Burgundy section. Loaded with stone and citrus fruits, zesty minerality and good acidity this mouth-watering white is delicious. Boillot specializes in Puligny Montrachet and Meursault and you can see the pedigree in this Bourgogne Blanc that drinks more like a wine from Meursault than an entry-level white.
",Chardonnay
"Made from a Chardonnay clone exclusive to Jura, this is a heck of a wine for the price... Made in a non-oxidative style (no ""nutty"" flavors), this wine manages to express a very rich aroma and flavor without any oak at all. Having covered the entire vineyard to prevent destruction from birds, the workers here have put a lot of effort into this bottle and the price is still very much within reach.
",Chardonnay
"I had the wonderful opportunity to taste the Delamotte Brut in a blind tasting of six wines, and this stood out as one of my favorites. My notes were riddled with adjectives like zesty, fresh and zippy, which can be attributed to the Le Mesnil Chardonnay fruit. There is also an amazing balance of stone fruit, Meyer lemon and a touch of toast on the finish.
",Chardonnay
"The extra brut from Bonville is always the same wine as the concurrent vintage, but not declared as such. It is all Avize Chardonnay and although the current batch had over four years on the lees, it is still very austere on its own. With sushi it is magic. The sweetening effect the hamachi had on this bottle was striking, and its flexibility with the spicy and pickled flavors from the embarrassing rolls that I like to order amazed me. The unbelievably clean, precise chalkiness of this wine put the Avize terroir center stage!
",Chardonnay
"Very crispy, clean, lemony with some surprising salinity on the palate. Not at all austere as the “extra-brut” suggests. It would be very good for aperitifs before dinner.
",Chardonnay
"Coming from one of our favorite producers here at K&L ( his Brut Selection is my perennial New Years Eve wine without fail), the Franck Bonville Extra Brut is another wonderful addition to his stellar line up. This is one of the purest, and most beautiful low dosage wines I have had the pleasure to taste.What struck me the most was the striking juxtaposition between the purity and richness of fruit, and the focus and drive you would expect from such a dry wine. There are toasty bread and spice notes, lush pear and golden apples combine with just a hint of florality. The finish is very clean, dry, and crisp, without too much intensity of acidity that you can sometimes find in an Extra Brut. The lasting impression that I took away from this bottle was the stunning purity of fruit, it tastes like amazing Chardonnay, in the end, making wine that allows such high quality fruit to show through is a noble accomplishment.
",Chardonnay
"The 2013 Thomas Fogarty Santa Cruz Mountains Chardonnay is 99% Estate fruit and 100% delicious. From all five Estate blocks this emanates from the glass with blanched almond meat, husked wheat, whole hazelnuts and fried polenta. Bright and energetic with a plush core of golden fruits and Shitake mushroom this shows both the power and savory intensity so often though of from SCM Chardonnay. Add Macadamia nut flesh, some forest floor flavors and fresh green herbs to the long and resonating finish and you really have a special Chardonnay that is not just built on texture and wine making but on the amazing raw material that Fogarty has to pull from. This really reminded me of a top flight St. Aubin at its very best but with Corton structure. Wouldn’t that be something?
",Chardonnay
"I don't think you could go wrong with this bottle of wine as it is quite delicious and a good deal. This Chardonnay is made from a winery that's been in the business since 1981 and is made of all estate, single-vineyard fruit from the Santa Cruz mountains. Lemon creme, fresh peaches, white floral and ocean spray are interlaced with bright acid and a weighty mouthfeel.
",Chardonnay
"Santa Cruz has quickly become one of my go to areas for serious (and seriously good) wine here in California. Although I am most familiar with the spectacular offerings from Domain Eden I am always happy to taste some one else'. I have had my eye on Thomas Fogarty, but had not had a chance to taste the Chardonnay until now. I must say I am super impressed. The wine has been allowed to go through malo, but in a very natural way. This gives the wine some weight, smoke, and richness. Due to the elevation though there is plenty of acid here to balance that out. Complex with alternating layers of fruit, oak, minerality, and acid this is a serious offering.
",Chardonnay
"This is classic Santa Cruz style Chardonnay. A bright and fresh wine that is harmoniously balanced with bright juicy acid, clean fresh fruit and a rich complex body. Not afraid to let the grapes speak for themselves, this embodies the purity of wine making.
",Chardonnay
"One of the biggest surprises on our recent trip to Sonoma was just how fresh and lovely the wines of Martinelli are. Gone are the days of super-extracted, high-alcohol Pinot and Chardonnay (don’t worry, the Zins are still as monstrous as ever), as we found there to be a lot more restraint and overall balance to the wines. A perfect example is the 2014 Martinelli “Bella Vigna” Chardonnay. Pretty, integrated oak plays nicely with milled corn and peach flesh on the nose with good lifting notes of lemon curd at its edges. Weighty but far from dull, this has just the right amounts of butterscotch, orange marmalade and dry honey that snowball and dovetail nicely into the soaring finish.
",Chardonnay
"For those hesitant to explore the wines of Jura, this is the perfect crossover.  The Chardonnay is all from Baud's vineyards in l'Etoile.  One of the signature points of this region are its tiny fossilized stars found scattered throughout the vineyards.  This little stars or ""etoile"" are fossils from ancient sea urchin or anemone that roamed this prehistoric seabed.  The soils are primarily limestone which are perfect for Chardonnay.  This is a non-oxidative style, a now very common departure from the traditional oxidative wines of the region.  The wine has gorgeous aromas of butter poached pears spiced with nutmeg, clove and cardamom.  It is supple on the palate and beautifully balanced in the mouth.  It is also an exceptional wine to pair with food.  I personally love it with smoked salmon, creamier or medium cheeses and with steamed shellfish.  For fans of White Burgundy and California Chardonnay, you will be amazed how close to home this brings you but with its own special Jurassic character.
",Chardonnay
"I've been growing very fond of the Jura region of France recently, and Domaine Baud in particular. This Chardonnay is very unique. While it is buttery, it doesn't taste like any other Chardonnay I've had before. Definitely worth checking out!
",Chardonnay
"This special Chardonnay from Domaine Baud is named for the star shaped Vineyards in the Jura which supply It's fruit, but also for the star shaped, fossilized marine organisms that can be found in the soil, which provide dimension and depth in the wine. If you are new to the white wines of Jura, this is a wonderful place to start. The palate is full bodied, yet fresh and with vibrant acidity, and without oxidation. There is a wonderful concentration of flavor in this wine, with aromas and flavors of lightly spiced poached pear, lemon peel, and briny, sensual minerality.
",Chardonnay
"The gorgeous Baud L'Etoile is an outrageous value. This is ""Chardonnay"" for the people that say they HATE Chardonnay. For me it's nearly the perfect white wine. Gorgeous golden color. A stupendous nose of rocky minerals, bright white currants and yuzu peel. Ultra clean and refreshing, but not light or low flavor. I love this style, but we usually have to pay $20 more to get there. Gonna buy a case before their all gone.
",Chardonnay
"Beautiful gold color, light and floral nose with a hint of spice. Apples, pears, great acidity with a long, slightly nutty finish for added complexity.
",Chardonnay
"This delicious Chardonnay is clean and smooth with a slightly salty tang and wonderful limestone and damp clay mineral tones.  The finish has hints of  savory wild herbs like tarragon and fennel and ends with a juicy citrus rind splash.
",Chardonnay
"A delicious bottle of white Burgundy, this has clean, focused citrus fruit and a notable mineral underpinning. For under $20, you are getting a wonderful wine from a classic white Burgundy vintage in 2014. And I would add that this wine just tastes tres, tres Frahnch....
",Chardonnay
"This round, rich rosé is a real affordable luxury. Composed of 75% Pinot Noir, 15% Meunier and 10% Chardonnay this tasty rosé gets its color from estate-grown Bouzy Rouge. Although thus far off of the radar of wine critics, I think this is the best wine from de Cazanove with its lovely strawberry color and aromas. Full bodied, but also nicely balanced, this wine will make a great aperitif or pair very well with a charcuterie plate or even an after dinner fruit salad.
",Chardonnay
"The Launois Severine is 100% Mesnil Grand Cru that is fermented in barrels. The barrels are made from oak timbered from their property right there in Mesnil. The wood has now been used a number of times, and although the first few batches were very oaky, the current release is super well balanced. This Champagne has the breadth and richness of a full on barrel fermented Champagne, but also the crisp precision of Mesnil Chardonnay. It is a fantastic Champagne, best suited to cuisine. I love it with grilled salmon -- especially done on a cedar plank!
",Chardonnay
"This is perhaps one of the greatest and most unique examples of terrior in Champagne I've ever personally come across. A careful picking of mid-slope Mesnil Chardonnay is vinified and aged in oak barrels made from 100% Mesnil oak harvested from the forest at the top of the hill. Talk about precision of place. The results are spectacular. The rich and oily texture is the perfect foil to the robust quality of the Grand Cru fruit. It is bursting with green and yellow apple, but also spice, both sweet and savory. There is a thread of nutty sherry like flavors that walks you through the deep complexity of the wine. While the Mesnil Oak is a strong presence, it doesn't overwhelm. Just provides the substance to make this an exceptional wine with heartier food dishes or to be immensely enjoyed as an aperitif.
",Chardonnay
"This super interesting blanc de blanc from Launois is made using oak from the forest just above Mesnil. It has an almost rum-like nose with spices, sherry oak and mocha. Sound unusual for a 100% Chardonnay champagne? Well, it is! It is also delicious enough to be a main course bubbly. On the palate, more mocha, with fino sherry notes and a citrus finish. The finish lasts and lasts and lasts. Simply put, a must try for any Champagne lover!
",Chardonnay
"Wow, this is something special and different!  All Mesnil fruit in oak barrels made from Mesnil Oak - like a double Grand Cru.  The Mesnil Oak lends a delicious oaky note with a wonderfully unusual and enticing oily texture.  Mid slope Mesnil pickings give classic GC fruit and power.
",Chardonnay
"This is a new project from perhaps the fastest selling Direct Import champagne producers that we carry at K&L. Aged in oak barrels that they had made from trees that grow right next to their vineyards, the wine shows a very different notes from the crisp cleanness that I have come to know and appreciate in Launois. Notes of vanilla and mocha weight the acid and add complexity to the wine. The finish is long and lingering with hints of roasted coffee. This is a fantastic food champagne for those who love something unique.
",Chardonnay
"Party perfect! Just when I thought I couldn’t love Aspasie more, they charm us at the annual Champagne Tent Event AND make improvements to their production facilities that send their wines over the top in elegance and quality. An unusual offering for the Aristons in that this is 100% Chardonnay, but with a creamier spin. The current release is from a single vineyard and spends over five years on the lees.  Paul-Vincent Ariston is committed to making exceptional value Champagne, and there’s no doubt he’s accomplished that here, especially given the celebration-ready magnum format. Aspasie Blanc de blancs is luxurious and age worthy, and I love turning savvy drinkers on to this family-owned favorite.
",Chardonnay
"From my top 10 Champagnes of 2012: I opened this magnum as business petered off on Christmas eve for the staff here in the Redwood City store, and it made me a popular man at K&L. Carrying a magnum around to the various work stations put a smile on many faces here, and the wine inside the bottle kept those smiles. This wine is single vineyard, from the very steep Gouttes d’Or site in Brouillet, and has a very different style than the Chardonnay from the Cotes de Blancs. This is creamy, decadent wine, and great on its own in the final moments of the retail rush…or just about any time! I need to buy this for my cellar.
",Chardonnay
"Biodynamically farmed and sourced from the celebrated Grand Cru Chardonnay villages of Avize and Cramant, this focused Blanc de Blancs is a sparkling powerhouse from a great vintage. Bottled at a slightly lower pressure than most Champagne, Roederer’s 2010 release has more delicate bubbles and a subtly coating mouthfeel through the palate. It was dosed at 9g/L and feels like it, with heady golden fruit and supple texture, but still shows all the bright acid and coveted chalkiness of a killer high-end Brut Champagne.
",Chardonnay
"I was very impressed with this young blanc de blancs from Roederer. The nose reminds me of yellow flowers because there is a richness to the floral aromas, yet very fresh. The same continues in the mouth, a rich, thin caramel-like texture with good acid and lots of crispness throughout.
",Chardonnay
"*Barrel Notes* All the Domaine Bart wines were tasted on our annual buy trip from barrel in March 2017. Loaded with bright orchard fruits and hints of lemon creme. Fantastic energy with zippy tannins and good acidity, the finish is amazingly flush with gorgeous fruit accents.

"One of the newest projects by Domaine Drouhin Oregon, is the Roserock wines. These wines come from a newer vineyard acquisition for Domaine Drouhin, but the vineyard itself is one of the oldest in the area. Planted back in the 1970's, this site now has fully mature vines and the quality of the fruit is fantastic. Combined with the passion and poise of the wine-making from Domaine Drouhin, the resultant wine is very dynamic. I'm a huge fan of this new label by Drouhin, and would highly recommend the wine to anyone looking for the best Oregon has to offer.
",Chardonnay
"Don't miss the two words ""Vieilles Vignes"" in the name of this wine. The lovely Blanc de Blancs of Boulard Bauquaire owes much of its complexity and depth to the 70-year-old vines from which the wine is made. Like a classic Blanc de Blancs, this wine shows elegant, stony aromas that are rather austere at first, but on the palate, the depth of flavor is phenomenal. Not only is there an impression of full, rich, apricot fruit and even some red berry elements, but the drive of the acidity takes a position here very well integrated to the whole. This wine is hardly lacking in body and richness, but it is not due to the boldness of a red grape, rather it is all in the old vine power.
",Chardonnay
"The Chardonnay used in this Blanc de Blancs comes from the illustrious Montagne de Reims, and the quality of the fruit is evident.  Lovely aromas of roasted almonds, butterscotch and sweet baked pastry lift from the glass; on the palate a soft chalky minerality rides alongside nicely balanced acidity.  Another fantastic addition to our Direct Import roster and outrageous value for the money.  Don’t miss this one!
",Chardonnay
"This is our most exotic and intense Blanc de Blancs, all from one ancient vineyard in the 1er cru of Trepail. This bottle just took the staff by storm when I poured a flight of all Chardonnay Champagne for my final staff training seminar of the year. The Boulard Bauquaire made bottles twice the price seem hollow with its wonderful richness and white fruit quality. Luckily, this Champagne also has a great dry, long, chalky finish!
",Chardonnay
"This was the highlight of a recent Blanc De Blanc tasting at K&L. This wine is so fine, aromatic and complex. I just loved the delicate floral aromas, lingering minerals and elegant texture this wine expressed. Just remarkable quality for a small grower Champagne of this pedigree and from an old vine parcel to boot. Awesome!
",Chardonnay
"Oh wow, I tasted this and immediately bought a case.  It's amazing to find any Champagne from seriously old vines at all, much less at this price. Rich and creamy as you would expect from all my colleagues' reviews and one of the best deals in Champagne in the store.
",Chardonnay
"What a charming bottle of bubbles. One of our newest additions to the line up, this a wonderfully enjoyable, open knit and effortless. The nose is cream and zest, maybe a touch of fresh lemon scone. The palate is soft and supple, perky notes of yellow peach and Meyer lemon, clean and pretty. The old vine material comes through on the finish, pure and lengthy. Just a joy to drink.
",Chardonnay
"This is a bright new star in our small-estate Champagne portfolio! It has a lovely, creamy nose of lemon meringue, bread dough and chalk. On the palate, it starts out full with golden apples, creme fraiche and macaroon. By the mid-palate, up pops the acidity and chalk and lemon flavors. Long, chalky finish that lingers. Tasted with the staff on 2/7 and everyone agreed that it was delicious and a great new find!
",Chardonnay
"I was completely shocked by this wine, but in a good way! They've really scaled back the oak this year at Ridge and allowed the crisp and clean acidity of quality Santa Cruz Mountain fruit to shine through. There's still richness there, but it's more akin to something like Chassagne-Montrachet rather than Napa. It's an elegant wine from front to back and that vibrant acidity makes me want more, and more, and more with each sip I take. Top notch stuff.
",Chardonnay
"A complex nose dancing between toasted hazelnut and saline oyster shell notes; spiced pear, autumn barley and crushed rock. A very mineral driven style, very Chablis like. It has a keen acid line and verve to it; great for Dungeness crab I imagine (I'll have to test it out)! Such a stunning value for Santa Cruz Mountain Chardonnay. Hand-selected from a patchwork of small, local vineyards around the appellation skillfully and seamlessly woven together by winemaker Colin McNanny.
",Chardonnay
"I tasted this beauty on the 8th of September. It is simply great with golden apple fruit, minerals and sea salt on the nose. On the palate, more golden apple fruit with just a hint of caramel and full minerality. It has the bonus of an extremely long finish of salinity and lemon meringue.
",Chardonnay
"If you like your Champagne clean and refreshing, this is the best bottle that we have for you. Antoine Billecart insists on fermentations that are slow and cold, and the family has developed its own strain of yeast that can work in super low temperatures, resulting in a Champagne that is light as feather and arcs with electric excitement. This wine delivers all of this without any harsh grain, since it has been aged for over sixty months on the lees... A fabulous treat!
",Chardonnay
"Bob and Jim Varner make some of my favorite wines. Not only are they extremely local (just up the road from our Redwood City store) but they make Pinot and Chardonnay to rival the greats. They always manage to strike a balance between rich, textural Chardonnay and bright acid and freshness that keep things interesting. The El Camino Vineyard Chardonnay is no exception. With fruit grown in Santa Barbara County that goes through full malo-lactic fermentation, but no new oak treatment, this wine is bright and clean. It has notes of baked apples and pears and well as a sparkling clean lemon freshness. At a very modest price given it's quality, this is the perfect middle of the road Chardonnay that will surely pleas the crowd at your next party.
",Chardonnay
"When I sat down to taste this at the winery, I didn't hear the owner and founding winemaker Harry Peterson-Nedry explain that it was a Chardonnay. I gave the glass a swirl, and aromas of lemon peel and mineral and a very light palate led me to believe that it was perhaps a Riesling. When Nedry explained that it was, indeed, an unoaked Chardonnay, and that ""Inox"" is French for stainless steel, I was totally floored by the purity of the style. You have to taste this wine.
",Chardonnay
"I had the pleasure of tasting the lineup of new releases from Chehalem on a recent trip to their vineyards in Oregon. Among several that stood out was this Chardonnay. Seeing no malo or oak,  it has so much beautiful white peach, green apple and citrus fruits, dazzling acidity and fresh juiciness on the palate that my taste buds were craving a full glass. Don't snub this varietal! Oregon Chardonnay is on the rise and this bottling from Chehalem is a wonderful representation of what the region has to offer.

"The Rincon bottling (from vines planted in 1984) is a bright, refreshing style with an abundance of nuances that continue to unfold as the wine opens in the glass. Starting off with crunchy apple and bright lemon, it then reveals subtle notes of honey, almond, and hazelnut, along with a wave of of tropical pineapple and pear. Mineral notes of flint and stone make an appearance toward the back end, providing the finish with beautiful freshness, salinity, and an invitation for another sip.
",Chardonnay
"An exceptionally well-made Chardonnay from a winemaker whom we have long been a fan of, this offering from Mike Sinor strikes a beautiful balance on almost every front. Buttery vanilla on the nose leads one to expect a richer wine, but instead this bottle shows a more racy, elegant side. Acid and oak work in harmony and carry the citrus and stone fruit here. A little maritime note from the seaside adds a touch of exoticism to the wine and really rounds everything out.
",Chardonnay
"California Chard lovers rejoice!  Here's a rich and wonderful Chard at an incredibly good price.With a Ripe pear and beeswax nose, lovely peachy fruit and a note of brulee on the palate showing a little creamy oak from the French and American barrels.  Nicely powerful but mercifully avoiding the RS trap.  It's a crowd pleaser and a very well made wine.
",Chardonnay
"This is a lovely wine for under $25.  The nose has some white pepper and toasted creme brulee notes while the body is very rich yet clean.  The finish is nice and long with a slight hint of sweetness.  Get some of this one before its gone!
",Chardonnay
"The Sinor LaVallee SLO County Chardonnay expresses richer tropical fruit notes such as Autalfo mangos and yellow pineapple plus the addition of torched marshmallow, crème brûlée, and baking spice.  It's a lush and heavy wine with enough acid to keep it balanced.  A phenomenal wine from the quaint little coastal town of Avila Beach, California.
",Chardonnay
"Butterscotch, kettle corn, and notes of grilled peach and vanilla bean fill the intense and fleshy nose. But as soon as you taste this one has to also be impressed with how balanced it is. Freshening up a touch on the entry with lovely lemon meringue and key lime pie flavors that ride over more oak laden tones of stone fruit, shortbread and peach cobbler this is impressively rich and somehow lifting as well. With just enough acid to keep it moving along briskly, plenty of weight to impress the “big” Chardonnay crowd and intense tropicality with lychee, mango and nutmeg  flavors in the finish this is a pleasing wine for just about any Chard fan out there.
",Chardonnay
"The Sebella Chardonnay from Hanzell is made in stainless steel with no malolactic fermentation so it's beautifully crisp with acidity and the minerality shines through. The nose is full of Meyer lemon, honeysuckle, grapefruit and wet stone that carries over onto the palette that’s round and supple with vibrant acid creating outstanding balance. This is a Chardonnay that’s more Burgundian in style and would be a wonderful match for sushi and shellfish.
",Chardonnay
"Another well-made, super-value white Burgundy contender is the 2014 Thomas Morey Bourgogne Blanc.  This wine has a delicious nose, ripe with spice, citrus and stonefruit. The palate shows a good balance of richness vs. acidity, with generous layers of green apple, wet stone and salinity.  Overall, a totally solid release!
",Chardonnay
"The two man team behind the Shaw & Smith wines have really come onto something great in their winemaking style. This Chardonnay comes from coastal vineyards and the cooler site is really reflected in the bright, high acidity present. That acidity is not overwhelming however, thanks to the aging on lees in French oak. This gives some good weight to the wine and draws out the fruit characters as well. I'm loving this producer now and if you're a fan of Chablis, this is right up your alley.
",Chardonnay
"A perfectly judged Chardonnay that strikes a precise balance between richness and restraint. This wine has the flinty, mineral, smoky edge that is so intriguing and is so en vogue in Australia right now but at the same time the wine has broad, mouth filling texture, lovely fruit weight and ripeness caressed with refined oak tones, all drawn out on the palate by vibrant (but not austere acidity). It's a very flavorful wine with concentrated white peach, ripe citrus, almond, brioche, some baked pear emerges as it warms in the glass, a saline edge adds whispers of Chablis. Such a great bottle of Chardonnay; I think almost everyone could find something to enjoy here.
",Chardonnay
"While the standard Belicard Meursault is fantastic, the premier cru Perrieres expression dials it up a notch. This has all the richness and balance of the standard village release, but with more fruit, more nuance, more delicacy of acidity and fineness of flavor. It's a more polished version of an already great wine. This is for special occasions because man does it taste fancy.
",Chardonnay
"This is such a brilliant and perfectly balanced Meursault! Fresh and vivid yet with deep and lush texture and beautiful vibrant acidity that lingers on endlessly. Breathtaking Meursault!
",Chardonnay
"Wow! I am a huge fan of Meursault and this is one of the best ones I have tasted. Loaded with flinty aromas as well as orchard fruits and Asian pear notes this beautiful Meursault is irresistible. The complexity and layers of this wine are confounding, it just stays on the palate lingering with a myriad of fruit and mineral notes. If you're searching for the next great producer of Meursault look no further: it is Pernot-Belicard.
",Chardonnay
"One of the highlights of our recent Napa trip, and one of my personal favorites, was White Rock Vineyards, nestled in the southern foothills of the Stags Leap range. First, we tasted the 2014 White Rock Napa Valley Chardonnay, which is grown in the lowest and coldest area of the vineyard, all barrel fermented, and aged for 11 months on the lees in French oak. The result is a clean, crisp and well-balanced wine with great acid structure and a wonderful intensity—all in a lean and focused package with no extra flab whatsoever. The Chardonnay has notes of Granny Smith apple, orange peel and Meyer lemon. This is the perfect Chardonnay to take on a picnic, or for a lazy afternoon at the beach. Needless to say, I plan on doing both!
",Chardonnay
"A very refined Napa Chardonnay.  A wine that has restrained richness and intensity that is driven by fresh acidity.  Citrus, apple and stone fruit aromatics with a touch of oak.  On the palate it is long and intense with cool fruits and a very subtle touch of oak.  Like everything they do at white rock, it is an incredible old world interpretation of Napa.
",Chardonnay
"This great Chardonnay is entirely barrel fermented, but its richness (and it is rich) is mostly lees based since they only use 10% new oak.   There are vibrant tropical flavors of melon and citrus, a rich creamy texture from the lees and time in barrel, and a well balanced cool climate acid to keep it fresh.  Great example of Walker Bay Chardonnay from South Africa.
",Chardonnay
"I'm rarely bullish regarding Chardonnay from New Zealand, but this one is different. This wine draws a clean line from Burgundy to Hawk's Bay, and is a standout for anyone who loves new world fruit in an old-world package. Tons of lemon and honey on the nose, excellent, forward acidity. Beautiful oak integration and that flintiness that you almost only get from old world Chardonnay. If you like Domaine Eden from the Santa Cruz Mountains--you need to try this. If you like Hamilton Russel from South Africa--you really need to try this. Big bold, lemon drop new world flavors tied up with gorgeous minerality. I dare you to send this into a blind white burgundy tasting as a ringer.
",Chardonnay
"Wow, this stunning Chardonnay from Elgin is amazing.  Wonderfully rich and textural mouthfeel, almost waxy with a round palate of ripe pear skin, creamy lemon curd,  and nutty lees.  Fresh and bright notes on the finish bring this around to completion with elegance and power.  One of the best SA chards we've had and at a great price.
",Chardonnay
"Lovers of rich, buttery Chardonnay need look no further. What I love about this Russian River Valley Chardonnay is the balance: though aromas and flavors of butter are ever present, the fruit is delicate and oak takes a bit of a back seat, leaving one to appreciate the prominent minerality and richness of the wine. Refreshing flavors of spicy fresh quince and meyer lemon leave a clean impression, with a long finish.
",Chardonnay
"Power and depth are the hallmarks of Boulaird Bouquaire’s Carte Noir, a Blanc de Noir made from 50% Pinot Noir and 50% Pinot Meunier.  The texture on the palate is round and lush, with deep rich flavors of honey, baked wheat, clove, hibiscus, lemon zest, apricots and ripe red fruit.  The finish is long and supple and lends itself to making the bottle disappear a lot quicker than expected.  Another phenomenal value from the K&L Direct Import Champagne program!
",Chardonnay
"This stone fruit driven beauty has beautiful acidity and a medium to full texture with bright citrus to compliment the richer texture. Nice, long finish with lingering lemony notes, kiwi, and peachy undertones.  Very balanced and superbly enjoyable!
",Chardonnay
"This Chardonnay is exactly what I would hope from the best of Sonoma Coast fruit. It's elegant and full-bodied, without being overly ripe or oak-influenced. The dominate notes here are citrus and floral aromas, followed by a luscious lemon curd on the palate, that retains its freshness and poise with an underlying clean, crisp acidity. Overall a phenomenal wine--Chardonnay displaying its most beguiling characteristics and all in keeping with the beautiful Sonoma Coast climate.
",Chardonnay
"This is fantastic, original, tasty Chardonnay, from one of the best places to grow Chardonnay in all North America: Williamette Valley, Oregon!  Super crispy,  very dry, tangy yellow fruit, some quince...delicious stuff!
",Chardonnay
"This wine is a game changer for anyone who thinks Chardonnay is not for them. Made with early-picked fruit from volcanic soils, it does not see any oak. It is bright, youthful and crisp with plenty of lemon and green apple notes on both the nose and the palate, vigorous acidity, and a long, mouth-watering finish.  If  you think all wines made with this varietal are buttery and rich, this super fresh and lean Chardonnay will prove you wrong.
",Chardonnay
"A classic rendition of one of New Zealand's best Chardonnays. All the hallmarks of what makes Kumeu River so special. Tension, texture, packed with flavor but lithe and energized at the same time. Crunchy quince, greengage plum, citrus rind, flint, almond skin, freshly baked bread. The wine has a broad and rich texture but also line, length and mouthwatering acidity. This wouldn't look out of place in a high-end Meursault tasting. Tons of class at a sharp price.
",Chardonnay
"Situated between the Tasman Sea to the west (12 miles away) and the Pacific Ocean to the east (19 miles away) the Coddington vineyard stays moderate to very cool all season long,  and it rarely ever gets past the mid eighties.  This long, slow ripening of the grapes combined with deep rooted vineyards that see no irrigation is the real secret behind Kumeu’s clean, elegant, and famously precise wine style.  In the glass you’ll find freshly baked lime tart, breakfast toast, citrus blossom, and an undercurrent of mineral water packaged together harmoniously.  On the palate the balanced acidity carries a clean translation of bouquet’s notes with some white peach and bolder citrus blossom.  This bright, elegant wine has a lasting finish that you may never see the end of as you regularly return for follow up sips…
",Chardonnay
"That's a very charming Chardonnay, not shy, but definitely not over-the-top, either. It has a beautiful floral nose with notes of roses, popcorn and cloves. The palate is very refined and spicy. Absolutely recommended
",Chardonnay
"Beautiful Chardonnay with qualities that I would expect more in an European wine. It is quite crisp and with a juicy acidity that would be a perfect pairing with seafood, and light Greek food. I had it with Dolmas and Taramasalata and it was heavenly!
",Chardonnay
"Of the 2015 Chardonnays I tasted while visiting the Talley estate this past March, The Rosemary's vineyard stands as the most deeply felt, fully realized offering. The house style seems to value the mineral expression of the terroir and a dedication to quality fruit, producing some incredibly linear, focused, and fresh wines. The Rosemary's however, shows a bit more depth and leesiness with its nose of honeyed nuts, subtle coconut, baked apple, and sea salt. While the palate is rounder and richer than the other bottlings, with hints of buttercream and warm spice, there is still piercing acidity and quenching textural tension from the chalky, salty minerality. This is gorgeous Chardonnay for any occasion, but perhaps paired best with a flaky white fish in brown butter.
",Chardonnay
"On Monday, September 12, I had the rare opportunity to taste the wines of the “the Clos.” The journey came to what could have been a sad end—because it was all over—with the 1999 Billecart-Salmon “Le Clos Saint-Hilaire.” Not so sad to end on this note! Amazing, amazing bead that goes on forever; dark and golden hued. Fine and frothy, with elements of smoke, exotic spice and anise. Once it opened up, it becomes even more intriguing with even more spices, praline, truffle and toast. Finishes softly and elegantly.  One hundred percent Pinot Noir. It is named after the patron saint of Mareuil-sur-Ay and this bottling is indeed heavenly!
",Chardonnay
"Here's a sunny day sipper that is easy and ready for immediate drinking.The nose has aromas of a lemon-like confection and on palate releases ripe and juicy pear and stonefruit notes with a nice texture and body. This would be an excellent choice for a quick mid-week pan-roasted fish dinner.
",Chardonnay
"There is something magical about the 2014 vintage in white burgundy, I think that I have said something along these lines in every bottle of 2014 white Burgundy I have reviewed. The reason is though because it keeps being true. As good as 2015 is, especially in reds, the cooler 2014 vintage with higher acid just leads to a more complex and tasty white Burgundy for me. That being said I love when the high acid meets generous fruit like in the Trapet Bourgogne Blanc. Crisp citrus nose leads to warm generous orchard fruit on the palate. There is a little waxy characteristic along with a touch of minerality and some honey and spice that are all brightened and balanced by the acid.
",Chardonnay
"The Trapet Rochelandet family has seven acres in Gevrey-Chambertin and uses fruit from the lieu-dit “Pruniers” for their Bourgogne Blanc.  They farm biodynamically and use native yeast, to create a beautiful classic Burgundian Chardonnay.  On the nose, green apples and lemon, with a hint of butterscotch, baking spice and leesy toast.  The acidity, which is the signature of the 2014 vintage, highlights and electrifies the rich fruit and leaves the flavors lingering for over a minute.  Pick this up for a wine with real pedigree at bargain pricing!
",Chardonnay
"The Golden Slope from Liquid Farm is not only a really well made wine, it's also quite possibly one of the best tasting chardonnays I've had from the Sta. Rita Hills. It's rich, full bodied, and the natural malo ferment makes it a true pleasure to drink. Give it some air for a good 30 minutes or so and enjoy.
",Chardonnay
"Such purity and finesse! You can taste the minerals from the soil, like fresh glacial water with citrus and floral notes. Great acidity with verve and tension this fantastic Puligny Montrachet crackles with electricity and beautiful fruit notes.
",Chardonnay
"With a distinctly spicy nose, the palate is rich and round expressing generous yellow ripe fruit notes with stony layers of minerality and salinity. This is juicy and luxurious!
",Chardonnay
"I remember the first time I tasted the wines from Tyler Winery. It was about six years ago and during the time when big, bombastic ""Parker"" wines were all the rage. But here was this fresh, young winery that was making high acid, structured, Old World style Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. Even I have to admit that initially I wasn't quite mentally prepared for such a racy style coming from a Santa Barbara county producer but I reveled in knowing that this wine would shut down the Francophiles who were always dogging Santa Barbara wines. The Tyler wines are focused, vivid and pure. For everyone that has ever doubted whether Southern California wines could rival Old World wines, the Tyler wines are a must!
",Chardonnay
"Trend setting winemaker Jayson Woodbridge does it again with this fabulous chardonnay.  Apple and honeysuckle nose gives way to a rich and textured palate with a long, sweet oak finish with a clean line of acidity that cuts through to the end.  Drink it now!
",Chardonnay
"""Brings the Burg,"" my tasting notes read. This is clearly a terrific site within the Chalone AVA for Chardonnay. A beautifully bright take on Chardonnay, with crisp apples and hints of fennel, as well as an impressive core of minerality and acidity. A serious Chardonnay.
",Chardonnay
"The 2011 Sangiacomo Chardonnay was one of the richer of the Chardonnay’s we tasted on the trip. Owner Craig Haserot focuses on mouth feel for his Chardonnay’s. This wine goes through full ML but still only see’s about 30% New Oak. This wine is definitely fleshy and creamy in the mouth. It is loaded with dense, rich fruit, hints of baked pear, figs and green apple. The finish is still bright and fresh, as there is plenty of acidity to carry the wine through.
",Chardonnay
"This Chardonnay is bright and lifted, showing green apple, pear, with touches of banana and vanilla. The oak is there, but very well integrated and doesn't interfere with the fruit notes, which are the highlights. Because of the oak, the texture coats the mouth beautifully and is well supported by zippy acidity and a touch of sweet spice. This wine would crush paired with oven baked salmon.",Chardonnay
"A perennial favorite of mine. Classic Swartland Chenin Blanc. Pure, unadulterated, amazingly drinkable white wine. There is so much easy soft fruit here with Chenin's slightly honeyed stone fruit characters and toasted grain notes. The wine is dry, but has a round, juicy character that makes it just so quaffable. Underneath this primary ripe fruit is a lovely underpinning of minerality from the old vines digging deep into those decomposed granite soils for which this region is becoming known. A fantastic value and a wine that I would recommend to just about any white wine drinker.
",Chenin Blanc
"Year after year, The Badenhorst Family consistently makes quality value wines, the 2013 vintage might be the most impressive yet. A bit reminiscent of Chenin Blanc from Vouvray, this Chenin expresses aromas of honey, nuts, aloe and lemon grass. Flavors of stone fruits dominate the palate, with apple, pear, and nectarine while great minerality and acidity form a great structured, well balanced and extremely quaffable wine.
",Chenin Blanc
"I feel in love with this wine last vintage, and the 2013 is making me fall in love all over again! Classic Chenin Blanc texture with the silky honey and citrus fruit, with gorgeous minerality and a bright high acid finish that makes your mouth water. I will be drinking a lot of this again!
",Chenin Blanc
"The dry wine, with its lush mineral components, apple flavors, sweet fig notes and rounded acidity, this is a perfect foil for complex foods ranging from savory to spicy. Methinks a little duck confit with a salad of bitter greens would complement quite nicely.
",Chenin Blanc
"Don't let the cartoony frogs on the label dissuade you. This Chenin Blanc from Vouvray is beyond exceptional. Crisp, clean, bright, and acidic, this Chenin makes a perfect summer white. You want a nice white to have with oysters? Look no further. This wine is great!
",Chenin Blanc
"As a Chenin Blanc lover, I hate when the wine is either too fruity or not fruity enough; I am drinking it for freshness and vibrancy. This is a knockout, especially for the price. The nose is light, slightly candied (giving the wine its freshness) and the palate is clean, not too texturous, and has a slight mineral drive for structure.
",Chenin Blanc
"This is a well balanced, aromatic and complex wine for under $15.  What more could you ask for!?  It's round and full but carries a bracing acidity to keep things lifted.  It's got a great, driving minerality surrounded by notes of delicious dried apples and apricots.  There's also something that reminds me of having steeped black tea alongside a pear upside down cake that I find especially appealing.  The 2016 vintage in Loire is regarded as high quality.  Throw an Indian summer into the mix which helped the parcels of Chenin Blanc ripen to their full potential, and you've got a particularly noteworthy Loire wine to grab.  This would be great with a savory tart or a ham, cheese and asparagus quiche.
",Chenin Blanc
"Another great bottle from this very talented winemaker! If you're looking for a white that appeals to a variety of palates, but avoids the common choices of Chardonnay or Sauvignon Blanc, Chenin Blanc is a great choice. This example from Bryan MacRobert has everything a good Chenin should--crisp, clean cut acidity, with good weight and a lovely, honeyed, floral nose.
",Chenin Blanc
"This is my first-ever tasting of Chenin Blanc  from South Africa and I am impressed! With this bottle you'll get a delicious balance of ripe fruit and aromatics on the nose with a great acidity to finish. It's simply delicious and certainly deserves to be on everyone's list to buy for white wine. Without a doubt, this wine will become a favorite with our customers and staff alike.
",Chenin Blanc
"This wine is exactly why I love Vouvray. All the richness and texture of the Chenin Blanc shows beautifully in the wine, but restrained and shaped by clean wine-making, and a cool climate. The wine is both elegant and powerful, with great acidity and texture, full, honeyed melon fruit, and clean, floral aromas. Delightful now, it will undoubtedly age beautifully as well.
",Chenin Blanc
"Cartology “maps” out the most significant and favored  old vines this dynamic husband and wife winemaking team (Chris and Suzaan Alheit) own or have access to from their neighbors.  This bottling brings those plots together in a meaningful cuvee that is the picture of South African’s finest expressions.  A full dense nose alerts you immediately that this will be a full bodied wine ready for deep thoughts and lots of return sips to watch the wine graduate through many beautiful cycles.  Lemon curd and mineral tones start the procession as yellow plumb and a variety of dry field herbs start to file into place. The first viscous sip confirms the nose’s intuition as the palate fills with briny lemon, ripe plum that is carried by the acid balance you hoped would structure the wine.  The finish is long and almost unending…
",Chenin Blanc
"Another beautiful showing from South Africa. The Cartology shows a rich, creamy palate with the Semillon being very prominent. Quince, lanolin, and a nice herbal component. It is never heavy, with a perfect balance between the richness and the acidity. It can definitely fill the niche for those wanting something different, and yet quite delicious!
",Chenin Blanc
"Just on the sweet side of things, drinking like a fine Auslese from Germany, this is unctuous and long on the ripe apple and caramelized pear flavors. You could treat this as more of an after-dinner wine, pairing with creamy goat cheeses, or get a little bold and serve it with rich curries or spicy Thai food.
",Chenin Blanc
"100% Chenin Blanc is the reason behind this honeyed, leesey, subtle citrusy nose. The palate shows lots of richness, with flavors of creme fraiche just ripe stone fruit and limes, as well as something unexpected...mint?  A beautiful, intriguing sparkler that can stand on its own but would also be a nice complement to spiced Indian or Vietnamese dishes where the go-to beverage of choice would be beer.
",Chenin Blanc
"I’ve always enjoyed the wines from Domaine Huët. This latest bottling from them proves to be no exception. Aromas of lemon zest, candied peaches, and tangerines play with aromas of stones, wool, sweet florals, and straw. On the palate, ripe stone and orchard fruit flavors are accompanied by stone minerality, straw, Meyer lemon, and lemon curd. A lifted acidity gives freshness without taking away from the lovely, weightier texture. It has similar sweetness to a German spätlese Riesling. A great choice with various cheeses, butternut squash soup, or baked ham.
",Chenin Blanc
"This wine was a total shocker for me. I always prefer the Haut Lieu Sec but, this Demi-Sec is a stunner! Orange marmalade, peach, and the right hint of citrus make this wine elegantly balanced. The slight bit of honey on the finish is not cloying and actually makes it even more interesting. A perfect cellar candidate! It will be interesting to see where this one goes with some years under its belt. At this price, I daresay it is even a good value.
",Chenin Blanc
"Wow! How good are these Storm Point wines!? Such fantastic value; these totally over deliver on price point! Crafted by Mick Craven of CravenWines (one of the most sought after small producers in the region) this Chenin Blanc mostly comes from old bush vines grown on ancient decomposed granite soils in the Swartland. It's packed with yellow fruits, citrus peel, stony minerals and toasted grains...all my classic markers for top notch S.African Chenin that often come at a much higher price point!
",Chenin Blanc
"The first white wine from the Loire that I've tried during my K&L career, and my favorite! This is, simply put, a delicious, well balanced, well structured wine with layers upon layers of flavor. A perfect harmony of sweetness and acidity that lingers beautifully on the palate.
",Chenin Blanc
"The Loire Valley chenin blancs are some of the best in the world, and Domaine Huet is widely accepted as the top producer of them.   The Haut-Lieu Vouvray Sec is a superbly crafted wine, with a rich aroma profile of golden apples with saffron spice, elderflower honey and cinnamon.  The flavors are focused by great minerals and vibrant acidity into a long, clean finish.  It’s truly one of the world’s top white wines at what amounts to a bargain price.
",Chenin Blanc
"This is such a beautiful wine!  It has concentrated flavors of honey, hibiscus blossom, pineapple guava with just a hint of almond nuttiness, all underscored by a subtle toast from barrel fermentation.  As the wine opened up and got a little closer to room temperature, the flavors exploded into a full on symphony for my taste buds.  The texture is phenolically rich and the finish long, dry and crisp with zippy acidity.  This is one white I want to put away to age for a few more years. 
",Chenin Blanc
"One of the most serious contenders for my white wine of the year, this 100% Chenin Blanc, barrel-fermented wine delivers all the roasted apple and quince paste fruit of Chenin with just a note of marzipan. It has a fleshy Burgundian finesse that brings to mind Premier Cru Meursault. But at one-third the price, this is a worthy additon to your collection. Jean-Noël is a vigneron to watch, as we continue with his gorgeous and complex wines for years to come.
",Chenin Blanc
"Seriously, why am I not drinking more Chennin Blanc? Especially when there are wines like this that have unbelievable complexity and totally reasonable prices. I swear there is something wrong with me. I am way into the La Coulee from La Source du Ruault. It's from a 1 hectare parcel, barrel fermented and aged. There is so much to get into here: a nose with mandarin oranges, candied lemon peel, navel oranges, honey and guava. A palate that is big, rich, heavy and intense. It may sound sweet, but is totally dry and beautifully crisp. If you ever come into Redwood City yell at me, tell me to buy a bottle of Chenin; you should probably pick one up too.
",Chenin Blanc
"Year after year this is one of the best valued dry Vouvray offered. It delivers all the things you want from Chenin Blanc, high acid and opulent weight plus more ripe notes of peach skin, white nectarine and jasmine.
",Chenin Blanc
"We don't get to sell aged Vouvray very often unless it's sweet and even then it's relatively rare. What we have here from one of Vouvray's most well-regarded producers is an absolutely stunning example of what just a few years in cellar can do to top-notch dry Chenin Blanc. The nose is brimming with stunning white and yellow fruit: white cassis and Mirabel plums. Behind that we start to see some slight nuttiness, not oxidation, but a hazelnut thing that's divine. Finally, some aromatic white flowers, but not gardenias. I hate gardenias. It's not perfumed at all, it's more tropical, with notes of fresh-growth floral vegetation. The texture is rich and balances and totally dry, but the nuttiness remains throughout as those fresh fruits turn slightly stewed. An exceptional value for an exceptional wine.
",Chenin Blanc
"Everyone talks about Huet being the best and for certain, it sits right at the top when it comes to all things Vouvray.  But when you ask producers in the region who they are most excited about - the name Foreau is the first one to roll off most tongues.  I recently revisited some of the Foreau wines and while the sweeter styles are sublime, I was continually brought back to the Sec.  I like dry Chenin.  Actually, I LOVE dry Chenin.  I think some of the most exciting mineral driven whites from anywhere in the world are made from this grape.  This Sec has just a touch of bottle age which rounds out some of the piercing intensity and lets so much of the limestone, roasted pear and quince flavors shine through.  Rich and intense with a laser like focus this wine delivers the goods.   It is so versatile you could serve this beauty with roast pork dishes, exotic spiced dishes like curries or maybe some crispy duck confit over a bed of greens and fresh pears.  The options are limitless.
",Chenin Blanc
"I believe Chenin Blanc is an underrated wine to be reckoned with. A versatile grape that has quite the ""je ne sais quoi"" quality to it. I often find expressive notes of exotic fruit and an undescribed savory character. The Jurassic Park Vineyard where Birichino sources the fruit has the oldest Chenin vines in the world (yup, not just in CA) and two pickings- one early and one later. The early picking gives a substantial amount of acidity while the later picking I found gives a more earthy/nutty character with that expressive white tropical fruit- like star fruit and dragonfruit- and tropical flowers like Frangipani.
",Chenin Blanc
"Liquoreaux is the sweetest and richest expression of Vouvray. It's made with botrytized and ripest grapes. Full-bodied, intense, nectar like, it's full of honey, peach and apple pie-like flavors. It also has interesting baking spice notes. Very unique and exotic dessert wine.
",Chenin Blanc
"If you just so happen to be a natural wine and sour beer lover, this may be the wine for you. This chenin blanc is so very unique and funky in it's own right that I honestly feel one must try this with an open mind. I had this bottle with a friend of mine who's a Natural Wine Advocate and craft beer connoisseur, and she actually enjoyed this bottle a lot. Definitely worth a try if you're feeling a bit adventerous.
",Chenin Blanc
"The Coteaux Du Layon region of the Loire is dedicated to the exclusive production of sweet white wines from 100% Chenin Blanc.  As a huge fan of off-dry and sweeter styles of Riesling, I found a new crush in Coteaux Du Layon.  This is rich and has a nice mouth feel from the sweetness of the residual sugar, but still brings a zippy, tingly acidity to the party.  There's notes of crushed pineapple, dried peaches and orange blossoms.  You could go in several directions with pairings here; pair this with something like a roasted pear and blue cheese salad or drink this with anything you'd typically pair with an off-dry or Spätlese Riesling, like spicy Indian or Thai food.  You could go classic and have it with a warm plum cake, or get weird with it and have this with something like Arancini di Riso stuffed with Gorgonzola.  It's so tasty, I'd drink this with just about anything though.
",Chenin Blanc
"I was totally blown away by this wine when we tasted it recently at a staff tasting event. I was utterly shocked when I found out the price. Sweet, but not too sweet, bright and vivid with gorgeous acidity, it's a stunning wine that is totally unique. Yes, this may be a dessert wine, but for those seeking more adventurous pairings, this wine would absolutely kill with spicy Indian or Thai cuisine. This chenin blanc is such an unbelievable value--I totally recommend it.
",Chenin Blanc
"If Loire valley whites thrill you as much as me, this wine should be on your radar.  It’s a Vouvray Chenin Blanc, though not labeled as such because the fermentation occurs outside of Vouvray.   It is incredibly expressive with zesty minerals, flavors of white raisins, honey, golden apples with great balance and length.  Pair with mild cheeses or an apple tartine.

"Customers seem to love or dislike Dolcetto with few in between. Fortunately, a solid majority of our Italian wine drinkers love it and when we come across one this good at this price, we don't hesitate to place it on our shelves. This esteemed producer has been making very fine wines for decades and this pure expression of Dolcetto attests to that. It's smooth and mouth-filling with delicious berry fruit, mild tannins and just a touch of acidity to round it out. It's great with meats, pastas, pizza and evening meals in general and the price makes it a steal.
",Dolcetto
"The true heights that the poor, overlooked Dolcetto grape can reach are found in this bottling.  Black cherries, tar, leather, peppery spice box and an earth dried leaf quality are all found here in perfect balance.  So many other Dolcettos are limp, watery strawberry juice with no soul.   Fiorenzo Nada has redefined the benchmark for Piedmont’s 4th red grape; look out Barbera, Dolcetto is coming for you…
",Dolcetto
"This Dolcetto is good, really good. And classic, really classic. Dark cherry aromas lead to a wine of the most gentle extraction and exquisite sense of balance. What good Dolcetto d'alba ought to be: just enough restrained fruit and tannin combine for serious Piemontese style points in this beauty.
",Dolcetto
"This has a great bouquet of crunchy blue and black brambly fruits, with a nice mid-palate weight and beautiful ripeness.  Very well balanced in terms of tannin and acidity. If you’re a fan of Dolcetto, you won’t want to miss this one.
",Dolcetto
"A Bold, ripe, and aromatic Dolcetto with an outstanding amount of acidity and structure. From the highest vineyards on the hills of Barolo, Sandrone picks grapes for his unique and fragrant wine. Many Dolcettos have moderate acidity but the high elevation brightens this wine and integrates the firm tannins while allowing the fresh violet and purple fruit character to jump from the glass.

"A stunning example of what Beaujolais can and should be. Beautifully fruited with racy notes of wet earth, herbs and spices, this delightful red wine can be slightly chilled and enjoyed with a multitude of cuisines. It is light enough to pair with fish courses such as salmon and sea bass, and it can also pair with pork, veal and some lighter beef dishes. Fresh and fruity but in no way insipid, this complex red is incredibly versatile.
",Gamay
"This Beaujolais is delicious and lively and shows what a good wine Beaujolais can be. It is soft with juicy dark fruit flavors that are balance out with complexity. It is medium bodied and ready to drink. It think that this wine is versatile and will go with many different types of  food and will drink well alone.
",Gamay
"This beaujolais is killer. Easy drinking, fruit forward, and best served chilled. This beaujolais makes a great party wine or even an every day night cap. I love this bottle.
",Gamay
"Chateau De Javernand produces out of Chiroubles, the highest elevation of all Beaujolais Crus.  The poor sandy, granitic soils, and higher elevation produce light, lifted, fresh wines that are entirely too easy to drink.  Beaujolais is an incredibly food-friendly wine and a life saver for difficult pairings.  Making spicy anything and want a red wine option?  Beaujolas!  This is like eating a basket of ripe berries while sitting on forest floor surrounded by fall foliage.  There are notes of ripe juicy strawberries and raspberries along with a leafy, potpourri thing happening.  This is a natural wine made without sulfur or filtration using organic grapes and indigenous yeasts.  This is one of my favorite new discoveries in the store and one I'll buy again sooner rather than later!
",Gamay
"The 1940 is light, easy drinking, fun and fruity! The flavor profile consists of a lot of cherry, blueberry,  and it makes a perfect party wine. I actually probably enjoyed this bottle more than I should.  It's great with food or by itself. And for the price point, you seriously can't go wrong with this.
",Gamay
"This 100% Gamay from The Coteaux du Lyonnais is a recent project of Guillaume Clusel, whose family has been producing wine in Cote Rotie since the 1950s.  It comes from on-average 30-year-old vines that lie between the Rhone Valley to the South and the famed Beaujolais region to the north.  The fruit is opulent and rich, creating a dense purple robe with a bright pink outline.   On the nose, cranberry and lavender perfume.  On the palate, dense Gamay fruitiness--cherry and cranberry--with a solid tannic structure that quickly slides into a smooth raspberry acid finish.  A very fun, unique and delicious regional wine! 
",Gamay
"This wine really took me by surprise. After having sampled a disappointing string of wines one afternoon, my colleague urged my to try this one. What a terrific Gamay! This is the kind of sub $20 red that I hope to come across in a bistro or café but rarely do. One that exceeds its price with delicious berry and blue fruit and a real sense of place. It's a versatile red that will pair with a wide range of foods (and maybe even seafood). Whether you're looking for a great table red or don't feel like springing for a Cru Beaujolais, try this one.
",Gamay
"This delicious wine is juicy, very dark and smells like a bowl of freshly picked ripe raspberries.  The deep middle of sweet mixed berry fruit with hints of granite minerality gives way to a long finish.
",Gamay
"This is a fantastic wine. It offers nice Gamay dark fruit flavors that are both juicy and balanced out with a nice crisp finish and a touch of earth. It is complex and packed full  of  pleasure. I think that it will go well with pork and lamb.
",Gamay
"Gewurz this good should come with a warning label! ""Caution - May be habit forming!"" I've yet to become a huge fan of white wines, but when I do find one I like, it's very likely that it will be a little dry, a little floral, with noticeable fruit, juicy acidity, and enjoyable minerality. This is all of the above in an inexpensive package. I opened this just the other day and it just kept getting more and more expressive as the time went on. A wonderful, expressive wine that's worth every penny!
",Gewurztraminer
"Tired of the typical parade of  pink Summer wines? This is such a fun and unusual rose for the warmer months. One hundred percent Gewurztraminer, this is a flirty expression of the varietal, with fragrant rose petal and violet leaf aromas. L'Union Sacre Belle De Nuit has a rich texture with clean and refreshing flavors of lemon and lychee, which dance playfully in a perfume of fresh honeysuckle and orange blossom. The ""Belle"" of the ball!
",Gewurztraminer
"This is warm, sweet and fresh with a middle of juicy berries and aromas of ripe plums and ash.  Here is a delightful super drinkable bottle to go with any kind of food and that is priced to purchase by the case.
",Grenache
"My only other experience with Cannonau is the brilliant offering from Sella e Mosca (both the 2011 and 2013).  So I was a bit skeptical about such an affordable, young version.  But wow, what a great wine!  It has fresh fruit flavors of plum, blueberries, brambly fruits and herbs, with a touch of baked pastry notes. There’s great tannins, and surprisingly great acidity for a warm weather Grenache!  This is going to age well for 5 to 10 years, easy!
",Grenache
"Aromatics of purple and red plums jump from the glass as you raise it to your nose. It is fresh with lively acidity, integrated structure and lots of sweet fruits- plums, raspberries and red cherries. The use of cement and stainless steel keeps the wine's integrity and character- soft spice and a savory earth component that adds to the freshness of ripe fruit throughout.
",Grenache
"Cannonau is one of the main red grapes of Sardinia and this is 100%. (Aka Garnacha, Grenache ) This shows,  middle eastern spiciness of sandalwood, cedar and plums, with bold, dramatic fruit character alternating with bursts of brilliant spice and pepper. A great cocktail wine on a cold winter’s night.
",Grenache
"This is classic Cannonau.  Unmistakeable from the first sniff, bold dark cherry and red fruit backed by a distinctive savory herbal note.  It is medium bodied but rich and mouth-filling, with lots of juicy dark fruits, dusty myrtle herbal notes and a modest amount of tannin and acid to pull it all together.  This is every night Italian wines with no edges nor extreme earthiness, yet unmistakably Italian.  Think red sauce, red meat, hard cheese and good company.
",Grenache
"Wow! This is a sexy beast of a wine. Lots of wild berry fruit, seductive aromas and silky tannins make this an irresistible offering. I had to do a double-take when I saw the price, I easily expected this to be in the mid-to-high 20s but was pleasantly surprised to see it at the jaw-dropping price of only $14.99. A flat-out delicious offering for under $15 this is a wine to buy b y the case.
",Grenache
"Cannonau is the Grenache of Sardinia, so if you're a fan of Cote du Rhone style French wines and food-friendly bistro fare, this is the Italian version. Plush on the palate and loaded with flavors of fresh berries, herbs, and exotic spices, the 2016 Pala is the perfect wine to get you out of your Dolcetto/Barbera rut. I'm generally on the hunt for lower tannin levels in my Italian red wine because I eat a lot of pasta and vegetarian dishes, so Chianti, Brunello, and Barolo are too heavy and overpowering without the meat. The Pala did just the trick over the holidays, offering up classic Italian flavor with an elegant and easily approachable profile.
",Grenache
"The nose is pure, focused plumy fruit, fresh but you can smell the intensity and focus. On the palate this wine isn’t ponderous it has great acidity to focus the richness of the body lifting those flavors and creating a vibrant and dynamic palate feel. The flavors are dense, powerful spiced plum with a great palate presence giving you the sensation of weight and power yet the wine is very drinkable and supremely well balanced. This is Grenache from Sardinia, it is called Cannonau there, and the Pala winery produces the “Fiori” or flower label as there ready to drink wines. Fermented in stainless steel then aged in stainless or cement tanks until released I find best when opened an hour ahead of time. I’d pair this with lasagna or grilled sausages, something a bit more rustic and filling for colder winter nights.
",Grenache
"Cannonau has gained attention of late due to its cultivation within one of the noted ""blue zones"" that dot the globe. People who inhabit these places are said to live the longest, healthiest lives and the Cannonau wines of Sardegna are included due to their polyphenolic content. Aside from the said health benefits, Cannonaus like this one are tasty, versatile red wines that our customers love. Pala's is bright and lively with scents of fresh raspberry, prickly pear, white pepper, and a pleasant touch of wild herbs. It's medium-bodied in texture and fills out with a bit of aeration. This is a great everyday red that will pair with a wide variety of mild and spicier foods. A wonderful island red.

"A super bargain from Spain with dark cherry flavors, supple tannin and just a hint of mocha. Nice acidity on the finish to brighten things up!

"This was the perfect accompaniment to an eggplant Parmesan meal I enjoyed recently.  An intoxicating bouquet of cranberry, cola and ripe strawberries greets the senses first.  The texture is silky smooth and distributes the rich flavors generously across the palate, finishing with a delicate acidity and lingering berry flavors.  A total pleasure to drink, and one of the best values in the store!

"Perhaps more than any other wine in the section, Borsao has introduced so many drinkers to great value red wine, Spanish style. Translation: this wine has loads of ripe, mixed berry fruits, an underlying earthy/smoky savory quality, and an attractive veneer of spice and toast due to a short time spent in oak. As always, there is a lot to like, particularly for fans of  richly fruited wines and/or those who are just starting to explore the diversity and value of Spain's wines. One of our most popular Grenache (Garnacha) based wines.
",Grenache
"Hailing from near Roses, Catalunya, off the road that leads to the beautiful village of Cadaques and eventually to Port Lligat, where Salvador Dali's house is located. This is perhaps the tastiest Grenache in the shop for under $12. Wonderfully bright black and raspberry fruits show a plump and fresh quality, making this one easy to drink.
",Grenache
"Easily one of the best rosé wines we currently have in store. This offering from Honorio Rubio is made in the clarete style from both Garnacha (60%) and Viura (40%) grapes. It is beautifully expressive on the nose with aromas of Bellini and raspberry crème brûlée, button mushrooms, and soft cheese. Flavors on the palate initial in ripe peach and strawberry, and slowly lead into bourbon vanilla and mineral notes on the finish. The acidity and round texture of this wine lend it to being incredibly versatile in food pairing applications. It is very easy to enjoy some Jamón Ibérico with it as well!
",Grenache
"If you're in the market for serious, expressive, barrel aged rosé, Honorio Rubio makes a wonderful rendition. His long lees aged rosé is a classical local Rioja style known locally as clarete: a blend of 60% Garnacha and 40% Viura, which combines red fruit with Viura's focused acidity and in this case, a lovely peach skin quality as well. Served with top quality ibérico, it makes for a memorable special occasion food and wine pairing.
",Grenache
"Great Garnacha is not too hard to find in Spain these days. At every price point and from various regions, there is great stuff out there, though perhaps the most impressive development  is the sort of pretty, brightly fruited, light on its feet wines which to many drinkers who remember, bring to mind an earlier era of Chateauneuf du Pape. I love the new Spanish Garnacha, and Zorzal's single vineyard Malayeto bottling really hits the spot: lively mixed berry fruits, juicy acidity and gentle tannins to support the wine make this Grenache incredibly easy to drink. Here's to the new Spanish Garnacha!
",Grenache
"If you poured this blind the first thing you'd think is that it was a Pinot Noir. The color is astonishing, light and ethereal. The wine is equally beautiful and elegant,but not lacking for powerful structure, this wine feels fresh and very complex . There is spectacular sweet fruit, raspberries in particular and an elegant oak treatment. If you're looking to probe the upper echelon of quality Grenache, this wine must not be missed.
",Grenache
"I love that this winery was able to pull fruit from the Bethany vineyard, one of the oldest Grenache sites in the Barossa. The fruit is concentrated, yet light, and the high percentage of whole cluster lends a smoky note and some underlying steminess. A different, lighter take on Grenache that I enjoy as it doesn't overload you with juicy, ripe red fruits. It's more subtle and complex even if the label is not.
",Grenache
"Made from 100% Grenache and only 9 barrels produced, this wine is perfect for fans of the esoteric and hard to get. The wine drinks big, but has plenty of silky tannin and fresh acid to give it perfect balance. Cedar, raspberry, sage can first be recognized, but further exploration shows plenty more. Peppercorns and clove are nicely integrated with notes of fig, blueberry and chocolate. A long powerful finish makes this perfect for hardy fare and BBQ.
",Grenache
"This is 100% old vine Garnacha, from an area in southwestern Rioja Alta where the quality of the Garnacha has been coveted by at least a few of the new generation of talented winemakers in the area. Aron is the name of Honorio's second son, and a fitting tribute with it's intense red Garnacha fruit. Even at 15% ABV, there is plenty of cut and freshness to balance things out. It is also quite educational to taste this Garnacha -  a grape which is the main component of Honorio's tremendous rosé wines (both the Lías Finas and Castillo de Vinas) - on its own.
",Grenache
"This is serious Garnacha! Grenache from granite, made by true masters of the genre, the team of Fernando García and Dani Landi. Named for one of their favorite comics, Comando G focuses on a very fresh, structured and brightly fruited style of Grenache that always seems to have me reaching for the correct comparison to do the wines justice: well made, traditional Barolo? Ripe vintage, 1er cru Cotes de Nuits  Burgundy, old fashioned, top quality Chateauneuf du Pape? Whatever the comparison, the Garnacha based wines from Comando G, when on their 'A' game, are some of the tastiest Grenache based wines out there. I've said it before, but it absolutely bears repeating again, these wines are as good or better than some of France's best names in Chateauneuf du Pape.  This particular bottling shows spicy, cinnamon laced, bright red fruited aromas which lead to fantastic, crunchy, lively flavors on the palate. A delicious wine.
",Grenache
"Grenache is not often featured in the US, and even in France it is typically found in a blend, yet this grape can be one of the most elegant and expressive wines I've ever encountered. Our friends at Comartin have come out with just such a bottling of Grenache! This is a lighter bodied wine, with lovely red plum and violet notes. It has a Pinot-like quality with smooth, fine tannin and aromatically-driven red fruit. I'd be hard-pressed to find a wine that I'd rather open and drink on almost any occasion.
",Grenache
"Let's see...in the year 1905 a young German physicist named Einstein published a paper on the ""Special Theory of Relativity,"" while a few hundred miles away in France a winemaker named Melia planted Grenache vines in the earth at La Crau. It would be immodest to compare the timely planting of grapevines to a scientific theory that forever changed the world as we know it, but all things are relative, right? Better just enjoy the results, as the fruit of those vines have evolved into something quite remarkable over their 112-year lifespan. The Le Puy Rolland is a special wine of ineffable fragrance and charm, quite unlike its more robust cousins throughout Chateauneuf-du-Pape. Perhaps it's the nature of the sandy soils beneath the pebbled surface that give this wine its purity and sense of finesse, a graceful nod to the ancient fruit that rises from each uncorked bottle, delivering flavors of cherries and cranberries and orange peel and warm earth, finishing smooth and silken. Makes me wish I could travel back in time and open a 2015 bottle for a young Albert Einstein. Expect miracles.
",Grenache
"What a unique and fascinating wine we are fortunate to be able to provide to customers. This old vine Grenache come from a mix of 130 and 80 year old vines, and the character of those years really shines through in this wine. It is complex, lifted yet concentrated, delicate, and has an absolutely elegant finish. Rich red fruits mingle with spice and and underlying acidity to produce one of the most engaging wines in the store. If you are looking for a wine that is both captivating and incredibly delicious, this should be your first choice.

"A new favorite liter-size Grüner is here! This ticks all the boxes for what I want in a summery white wine, but the quality far exceeds what's expected of a value-format bottling. The 2016 Pollerhof is mineral-driven and crisp, with that classic Grüner white pepper lift and subtle, but apparent, arugula notes. Plus the estate rescues chickens! Delicious, fresh, and philanthropic: Pollerhof Grüner Veltliner is finally back in stock with a stellar new vintage, and ready for all your warm weather needs. You don't even have to pack a corkscrew.

"Bernhard Ott was already a favorite Gruner producer here at K&L before I started so I cannot take credit for the introduction, but we can all bask in the beauty of the current offerings!   2015 was a lovely wine and a staff pick last year, but in 2016 Bernhard was able to add even more depth and complexity to this biodynamic wine.  On the nose I found a variety of grapefruit notes (white and pink) intertwined with mineral water and white pepper.  The weight on the nose was impressive for a Gruner and seemed to have a heavier yellow plum base propping up the citrus we are so accustomed too.  On the palate the body is lush with grapefruit again and now key lime joins.  There is a green leafy herb element that tries to conjure echoes parsley or cilantro.  A very expressive wine by a master winemaker and a perennial K&L staple!
",Gruner Veltliner
"""Am Berg"" Gruner Veltliner from Bernhard Ott has become a beloved wine and go-to for us here at K&L. Consistent and delicious every year, 2016 vintage is brisk, fresh and crunchy. It's full of bright lemon and pomelo fruit supported by serious minerality coming from loess soil in the vineyard. Done entirely in stainless steel to preserve purity of fruit and freshness this wine still has great mid-palate that turns into long lasting finish.

"If there is one sparkling rose you need to try this summer, it is this one. A blend of Zweigelt and Pinot Noir, there is plenty of juicy strawberry and raspberry fruit with a hint of rose petals. The aromas indicate there could be some sweetness to this sparkler but it finishes dry and its creamy mousse is luscious. This is absolute fun to drink and should be a staple in your wine fridge for the summer season. Enjoy with fried chicken, grilled sausage or have a glass after a long day at work.
",Gruner Veltliner
"I really enjoy the interplay of the two varietals here, Pinot Noir and Zweigelt. While the Pinot lends elegance and finesse the Zweigelt adds textural richness and spice. Such a fun wine...
",Gruner Veltliner
"One of my favorite expressions of Gruner from a great producer. This is certainly a more strict, racy, mineral driven style than many of the bigger, weighty versions from the Wachau...I love it's freshness, drive and lingering, mouthwatering finish. So versatile as a summer white. Refreshing, moderate alcohol and a stunning value for money.
",Gruner Veltliner

"Green and slightly peppery with arugula notes and a tropical finish, plus incredible texture – there’s a richness to the Schmelz Pichl Point not often found in Grüner Veltliner. Bright with Asian pear and stone fruit, this excellent example of 2015 is both quenching and serious with powerful minerality, and will even age well.  Weighty and delicious.
",Gruner Veltliner
"This is not your juicy, easy going liter bottle of Gruner, this is serious Gruner Veltliner. This is a powerful, rich Gruner with lots of acid and lots of potential to age.  Exotic spices, green peas, Asian pears, and stone fruit dance on your palate. Grab a few for Thanksgiving dinner and add a bottle to the cellar to try in 10 years, if you can wait that long.

"Smaragd is the ripest, most full bodied wines in Austria. All grapes destined for this designation must attain at least 18.2°KMW (KMW stands for ""Klosterneuburger Mostwaage"" and is a unit to define the amount of natural sugar in wine must) and all finished wine must be sealed with a long natural cork that is at least 49 mm long and branded with vintage year. The wines have to be aged in bottle and not released till after May 1 following harvest. Smaragd wines tend to be the most sought after and critically acclaimed Wachau wines with the potential to age for more than 20 years.  This Gruner Veltliner is a magnificent example of such wine. Very juicy and dense, extra rich and yet elegant, dry and powerful with deep exotic fruit and bright acidity.
",Gruner Veltliner

"The ""lion bottle"" as I affectionate call this wine delivers a quite nice ""roar"" - The   perfectly ripe grapes are picked a bit early to preserve their natural acidity. the wine is then aged with lees stirring to add richness.

"Alto Adige is Italy's only wine producing region with several high quality wine producing co-ops.  Other regions may have a few good co-ops, but not the concentration you find here.  Erste + Neue is the product of a merger bringing together the first (""erste"") wine co-op (1900) and the new (""neue"") wine co-op (1925).  This rosé is a blend of the regions indigenous Lagrein (20%) with Pinot Noir (20%), Merlot (30%) and Cabernet (30%).  What you get is a fantastically juicy, yet dry and fresh rosé with lots of ripe strawberry and cherry notes along with stony minerality and a slight blood orange peel bitterness on the palate.  This has great zippy acidity and is entirely drinkable on its own, although this would be great with a roast chicken or charcuterie.

"This is a great everyday drinker, even better a party wine, it is simple, charming and very drinkable.

"A quality sub-$10 Malbec from Mendoza. This Argentine red draws you in with aromas of boysenberry, açaí, and blue fruit. Underlying tones of espresso powder chocolate, and leather.

"I've always had a soft spot for this over-delivering Malbec, but perhaps never more so than for the 2014.  It's a ton of wine, especially for our sub-$8 price and it probably won't be long for our shelves at that.  The color is a deep ruby, but the aromas are lined with blue and red fruit.  The palate is fresh and vibrant, exceptionally balanced, and concentrated without being heavy.  The style almost has me thinking $25 Côtes du Rhône.  Either way, an easy-going bottle that begs to be shared and one you won't have to think twice about opening at a modest $7.99.

"I would urge anyone reading this to not be turned off by the low price of this wine, since it: a.) is delicious and b.) drinks at least as well or better than many of the $10-$15 reds in our already highly curated selection. Tilia is pure, plummy  Malbec, but with loads of freshness and drinkability. There is a much drier and more serious palate impression than what one may expect for under $10 red. A naturally occurring 13% ABV thanks to a cooler vintage, this is fantastic wine for any and all value seekers. Just might be the value red of the year for me - don't be shy about the price, you will love this wine. Added bonus: Tilia continues to be made from organic grapes.

"I love the direction that affordable Argentinian Malbec is headed. This wine is taut and focused, with plenty of ripe berry fruit. Notes of plum and blackberry on the palate deliver you to a slightly tannic and spicy finish. How can this wine be only $8.99?!?!?

"This is a steal. We all know Malbec is a bargain, but this wine has it all. Gamey, dark fruit with a pleasantly plump body and bright acidity with chewy, ripe tannins: this wine is a no-brainer. Perfect for parties, or as your new house red!

"It's inky, lush, and plummy - three components that I adore about  Malbec.  This is an easy-drinking, full-bodied wine that bursts on to the palate with notes of dark cherry, mocha, black currant and baking spice to finish.  A very, very nice Malbec that drinks well above its $8.99 price point.

"It's back, with a 95-point rating!  A generous and friendly Malbec with  great structure and supple fruit.  Rich, ripe black plums, mocha and balanced, toasty oak.  It has a fair amount of tannin complemented by an equal amount of acid, and juicy red fruit on the finish.  An amazing deal!!
",Malbec
"As it did last vintage, the Tapiz Malbec certainly wears its right bank Bordeaux credentials on its sleeve, while still leaving no doubt that we are drinking a generously fruited, rich and ripe Malbec of sunny, high plateau Uco Valley origins. A balanced, agreeably toasty nose leads to dark plum and fig flavors on the palate, with just a bit of Bordelaise inspired tannin structure and roasted coffee bean nuances coming through as well. The overall impression is that of a fruit forward and nicely structured Malbec to enjoy immensely now and over the next several years. Grab some sooner than later, as this was our most popular Malbec last year, and likely to repeat this year as well.
",Malbec
"Don't think of this Malbec in quite the same way that you're accustomed to thinking of the grape. This is French Malbec at its best--with restraint and structure, capable of aging, and an excellent complement to steak. While it still has the enchanting black fruit and spice characteristics that we love in this varietal, it is neither jammy nor sweet-fruited, but well-balanced, with an excellent structure. If you're a Bordeaux fan, or love Bordeaux-style wines, this is absolutely one you should try.

"When most people think of purchasing a bottle of Malbec they invariably seek out the lush, full-bodied, fruitful red wines of Argentina. Not to argue, but it’s easy to forget if they ever remembered, that Malbec’s true home has always been in Southwest France, in the misbegotten wines of Cahors, where it flourished for centuries until the phylloxera bug and devastating frosts almost annihilated it. We’re forever thankful that it survived, as Haut-Monplaisir has defined in almost textbook fashion what this grape will give you in temperament, pleasure and finesse when grown on the soils of its native land— luscious, aromatic blackcurrant fruit augmented by licorice, vanilla and spice, with a silky suppleness and weight that poured itself with aplomb into the glass. Stunning Malbec, and I guess if the bottle could speak it might say ‘don’t cry for me Argentina’!
",Malbec
"Back to back successes with the Haut Monplaisir has solidified it as one of our favorite Malbecs from any region.  Both the 2011 and 2012 were quick sell throughs with their level of quality, concentration and power.  The '14 offers up something even more special in my opinion.  Sweet black plum.  It was such an evident marker, I would have used it in a wine class on flavor profiles.  It's not the only thing going for this wine though with its beautiful blackcurrant, gorgeous weight, full-bodied texture and loads of spice notes.   It is a hallmark Malbec showing the best of what can come from its home region of Cahors.  Easily the sexiest of the last few vintages, you would be hard pressed to keep you hands of this beauty while serving it with hearty winter fare and dare I say even some grilled Argentine steak?!  Let's show those southern hemisphere Malbecs how it's done old-school French style.
",Malbec
"I love this producer so much. I have a thing for savory wines, and the Haut Monplaisir has that in spades. Meaty, gamey, almost a touch bloody aromatics with dark, dark, black fruits and earthiness on the palate. It's has some serious weight and concentration, but still displays a silky texture with rustic tannins and exceptional balance. My all-time favorite cahors.
",Malbec
"We all know Malbec can be a great wine for the price, and here is yet another example! The aromas are exuberant and full of fresh, sweet blueberry and blackberry fruit.

Perhaps a new Tuesday night staple?

"Here we go again, another fantastic buy in Argentinian Malbec!  Modern and fruity with a lovely perfume on the nose and a truly serious offering for an everyday price.  If you're a fan of Malbec you NEED this wine for something easy to reach for all week long
",Malbec
"Impressive and sophisticated, the 2015 Don Rodolfo opens with an almost old world feel, presenting a dusty nose and hints of spice, but rings true to Argentinean Malbec’s black plum and dark, bold berry fruit through the palate.  There is structure and some pepper to the finish, but overall this is a supremely drinkable, juicy option at a surprisingly low price.
",Malbec
"We've been utterly spoiled lately by the influx of flavorful Malbecs for under $10 a bottle with qualities way beyond what their price-points suggest. Don Rodolfo continues this trend with aplomb, offering a bottle with richness, structure, and integrity for only $9, and over-delivering on each count. A waft of fresh herbs meets the nose first, along with a spicy Worcestershire note. On the palate, sweet tannins wrap the bold, ripened red berries and spice notes together on the mid-palate while subtle cocoa lingers on the finish.
",Malbec
"It's not often that we have sub $9 wine we are so excited about that it merits an email, but this Malbec is undoubtedly an exception. Juicy, plummy fruit with just a hint of cracked pepper and underlying wood smoke makes for one gulpable weeknight red. Quite a tasty red on its own, but also this is perhaps the perfect burger wine!
",Malbec
"Equal parts Malbec and Cabernet Franc and delightfully delicious.  The middle is round, dark and juicy from the Malbec but the soaring raspberry aromatics and savory herb and tobacco laced finish screams Cabernet Franc through and through.  This is exactly the kind of inexpensive bottle you always want to have handy to pop open on a whim or to match to practically any Tuesday night cuisine.  A case purchase for sure.
",Malbec
"Composed of equal parts Malbec (known locally as Cot) and Cabernet Franc, the wine is aged in stainless steel, keeping the fruit in its most vibrant state. It is loaded with flavors of sweet black cherry and blueberry jam, crushed thyme and savory spices. It is open, forward and delicious. This wonderful red will pair beautifully with braised pork dishes, creamy cheeses and herb roasted chicken.
",Malbec
"Benmarco head winemaker and viticultorist Edy del Popolo is a rare talent, someone who not only knows his region (the Uco Valley, Argentina) and its great terroirs, but viticulture, winemaking, and the increasingly diverse world of fine wines as well. What makes this Malbec and Cabernet Franc blend so special is the calcareous terroir in Gualtallary, the juicy, rich mixed berry fruited mid palate, and the sense of freshness towards the finish. Richness with a sense of balance. If you're a fan of California's  higher end,  mixed red blends, you should absolutely try this wine and see what you've been missing in Argentina's Valle de Uco. And if you're already keen on Malbec, then this is a must try.
",Malbec
"Deep, rich and powerful, this is a Malbec/Cab Franc blend for those who love big and bold styles. A generous use of oak adds a good amount of sweet spice and mocha notes to the naturally soft black fruit of the wine. The tannins are restrained, though present enough to work well with a good cut of meat. Excellent expression of the richer, bolder style of Uco Valley wines.
",Malbec
"Aleph is one of the producers you may pass over because their label is pretty nondescript.  You would be making a terrible mistake.  Holding back their wines a little longer before release, the wine reaches the pinnacle of old world styling with new world intensity.  Reaching the flavor profile of some Napa level greats - aromas of blackcurrant and melted licorice abound - this has style and structure that speak closer to Bordeaux or Cahors.  You would pay twice as much for not nearly as interesting a wine from California, but you don't need to, the Aleph is hiding in plain site.  Just ask for a bottle, we'll track it down for you.
",Malbec
"Aleph continues to make some of our favorite Malbecs - delicious and often with the added bonus of some extra bottle age. Fruit is sourced from Lujan de Cuyo, the traditional home base for Mendoza wine country's historic bodegas as well as the area containing the largest number of older vineyards. As usual, this bottling is bright and quite tasty, with excellent depth of flavor and texture.
",Malbec
"For those curious about high-end Cahors, the ""Pur Plaisir"" is the wine that truly plumbs the depths of richness and intensity that can be achieved in this region.  The wine is full bodied, velvety textured and loaded with dense blackberry and currant fruit.  Layers of smoky minerals and Asian spices round out the flavor profile.  We don't often delve into this price point when looking at Cahors because there doesn't seem to be as big a market for collectible wines from this region.  That doesn't mean the quality isn't there though.  Stack the ""Pur Plaisir"" up against similarly priced Bordeaux or Malbecs from Argentina and this more than holds its own.  In fact, you'd likely pay upwards of two to three times as much for comparable quality.
",Malbec
"This Malbec has lovely, fresh, plum fruit with accents of black pepper, as well as the fine tannin structure present in Miras' Pinot Noir. Honest, purely fruited, bright and so easy to drink, I would not hesitate to recommend this graceful Malbec to fans of medium bodied or even lighter wines, including Pinot Noir. Highly recommended!
",Malbec
"Agrelo is a village famous for the quality of its soils and vineyards. The Cabernet and Malbec from here, in particular, is delicious, often times with a nicely rounded, soft quality to the tannins, which makes for especially elegant wines. Naoki's vineyard contains calcified marine fossils, lending freshness to the wine. That said, perhaps more than anything else it is the sumptuous wild plum fruit and violet floral notes which really seem to define this delicious bottle of Malbec.
",Malbec
"This Malbec, grown in calcareous granite soils at incredibly high altitude, is the real deal. Brawny, savory, and violet tinged dark fruit aromas on the nose, coupled with a generous melange of fruit (think purple skinned fruits, lush yet fresh and mineral as well), bring to mind Hermitage. Two years in well seasoned oak barrels seems to have given this wine the perfect amount of time and development needed. Intense, persistent, and long, this is quite possibly as close to perfection as I've ever had in a young Malbec. Impressive now, I suspect this will age very nicely as well. With only a few barrels produced, this is top quality, collectible Malbec.
",Malbec
"A serious Malbec from the Uco Valley  paraje (sort of a designated area within a growing area, somewhere more specific, but not a single cru or vineyard) of Altamira, this wine shows serious dark fruit, elegant florals, balanced acidity and elegant, long tannins. One of our best Malbecs currently in stock.
",Malbec
"Yum! Peach, melon, citrus and floral notes. A juicy, crisp and delicious blend of Malbec and Pinot Noir. Yeah that's right, when was the last time you had wine with those two varietals?
",Malbec
"In two words, simply delicious! Pretty and bright with a grapefruit and jasmine nose. Clean and bright on the palate nectarine, grapefruit and lime. Wonderful finish with a touch of saline and peach. So perfect for hit summer days and either sipping alone or with salumi and hard cheeses. Yum!
",Malbec
"This is terrific Malbec, with nearly 15 years bottle age, and therefore a real rarity. Great presence on the palate - dark fruits, graphite and some savory hickory smoke notes as well, but still fresh. The Malbec in this bottle comes from 90 year old vines in the La Consulta district of the Uco Valley. Maybe one of our best deals in serious Argentinian Malbecs.
",Malbec
"Hermitage blanc is something special. From a single hillside vineyard above the Tain L’Hermitage, the appellation is typically well known for its ageable reds, but are rare due to the small size of the hillside. White Hermitage is even more rare. Yet, it stands as one of the worlds great white wines that age beautifully, and showcases rich complexity. At its price-point the Remizieres is an absolute steal. It shows rich melon and honeyed tones with tart apple, and a finish that goes on and on. This is a stone-cold serious wine that will only get better with time.
",Marsanne
"A wine inspired by Callum's time working with Rhone icon Jean Louis Chave in Hermitage. This is an homage to Chave's legendary white Rhones. A rich wine with texture and weight but adequate acidity to keep it balanced and long on the palate. A tiny production wine, part fermented in stainless and part in new French oak. Only very minimal fining and no filtration to retain as much richness as possible. A wine that uses phenolics for structure and longevity. I'll be super intrigued to see how this ages...I suspect very well.
",Marsanne
"This is such a lovely, easy drinking wine at a great price point. Domaine De La Chaboissiere does Muscadet like no one else, with incredible aging potential and balance. Squeaky clean, but with depth and presence, this wine has lingering minerality and crisp notes of lemon peel and wet stone.
",Melon de Bourgogne
"I recently re-tasted this delightfully inexpensive little Muscadet and was reminded of how good this wine tastes. Even with the long aging on the lees this wine has everything people are looking for in a Muscadet. Bright, clean, a little floral and saline characteristics all come together with plenty of acid and lift. There is a surprising amount of fruit weight here but with an incredibly clean finish. This is definitely a bottling that one could keep around for tons of occasions.
",Melon de Bourgogne
"Demand for Muscadet has definitely been on the rise of late so we've not only answered the call but also exceeded expectations with the arrival of this impressive direct import. It's a traditional style Muscadet that's very floral with additional scents of seashell and pure saline and mineral notes on the palate. Good weight and texture belie great acidity as well. We're expecting a lot of repeat customers when it comes to this one.
",Melon de Bourgogne
"From a sustainable producer, this has got to be the best ""sur lie"" I have ever tasted for the price. Although the wine spent 18 months on the lees, it remains very light with lifted fruit, zesty acidity, and the characterizing touch of salinity. Great with oysters, but if none are attainable, french fries will do just fine.
",Melon de Bourgogne
"The “Harmonie” Muscadet Sevre et Maine is quite appropriately named, it has a lot going on but it all comes together for a well-synchronised wine experience.   It’s bone dry with remarkable minerality for its price point, and is rounded out nicely by fruit flavors of melon and citrus. It’s light bodied with good acid, making it a great food-pairing wine as well.
",Melon de Bourgogne
"The newest vintage of the Harmonie will make fast friends with anyone looking for crisp, clean, mineral-driven wine to quench the palate. Always a good next step for Sauvignon Blanc drinkers, Muscadet (not to be confused with Muscat) sets itself apart by effortlessly balancing fruit, acidity, and terroir into an elegant and refreshing flavor profile featuring green apple, Meyer lemon, stony minerality, and a hint of seashell. Perfect pairing with seafood or a rich, piping-hot chowder.
",Melon de Bourgogne
"The ""Harmonie"" Muscadet is a consistent staff favorite due to the fact that year after year it drinks well beyond its price point. Muscadet, not to be confused with Moscato, is a wine making region in the coastal area of the Loire Valley where they make a very dry, mineral driven wine from a grape called Melon de Bourgogne.  With aromas of wet stones, sweet peas and white flowers, the palate shows chalky, limestone minerality with flavors of lemon curd and white nectarine. Consume this bright, dry, mineral-driven wine the way the locals do, with oysters or just about anything from the sea.
",Melon de Bourgogne
"Somewhat softer and less chalky than previous vintages, the 2015 Harmonie is a friendlier Muscadet, but no less varietally correct, with bright lemon tartness and enduring minerality.  While there are hints of honey and more tropical fruit, the crisp finish never fails. I look forward to Harmonie's release every year -- so happy this great white is back in stock!
",Melon de Bourgogne
"Lime, brine, and wet sand aromatics greet you on the nose; and it is very much a ""on the nose"" Muscadet. Take a sip, and you'll find all the quivering nerviness you'd expect, though behind the tartness and salty minerality, there lurks a suggestion of sweet apple in pleasant counterpoint. The Harmonie is easily one of our best white wine deals going, so if you aren't already familiar with it, it is past time to get acquainted.
",Melon de Bourgogne
"I’m in love with the 2015 Muscadets! And, this is one of the reasons why. The fantastic balance of bright fresh citrus with layers of stone fruit texture, mineral nerve and uplifting back end palate length and concentration. Not to mention that this is an absolute killer with all kinds of foods from simple cheeses to fish to complex charcuterie …
",Melon de Bourgogne
"What a pretty and easy to drink Muscadet! Clean, dry and mineral, but also full of tropical fruit. It is an amazing combination that I always find incredibly successful. Wine fermented and aged completely in tank and if you love Chablis and crisp white wine in general, definitely try this Muscadet.  It's a steal!
",Melon de Bourgogne
"Just in time for Dungeness crab season, this fresh, mineral driven offering from Bedouet is the perfect accompaniment to a heaping plate of crustaceans!  Notes of chalk, lemon flesh and salted ripe pineapple provide a clean, bright palate with zippy acidity.  This would also make a natural pairing for rich cheese, oysters and fish in beurre blanc.
",Melon de Bourgogne
"This is an excellent Bordeaux from one of the top recent vintages, but coming from an under-the-radar winery in the Haut-Medoc. Chateau Coufran tends to use more Merlot in their blend, lending the wine some silky, black-fruited elegance which nicely counters the firmer structure and earthiness of the Cabernet from this region. Truly one of our best bargains for stellar 2009 vintage!
",Merlot
"Chateau Coufran lies just north of St-Estèphe in the village of Saint-Seurin-de-Cadourne. There are 76 hectares of vineyards planted entirely on gravel soils close beside the Gironde River. Atypically for a Left Bank property, the grape varieties planted are almost entirely Merlot (85%), earning Coufran the nickname “the Pomerol of the Médoc”. I had the good fortune to taste a barrel sample of the 2009 Coufran at the chateau in 2010. The owner, Eric Miailhe, confided at that time that he considered it the finest wine he had ever made. Now, five years after bottling, the wine truly shows the strength of the outstanding ’09 vintage – very fresh with lively acidity and very fine, but still firm tannins. There is plenty of sweet fruit here with notes of fresh picked blackberry and damson plum. A terrific value from one of the great vintages of the decade.
",Merlot
"It's great to see how this wine has come around over the years. We've been getting shipments of the 2009 Coufran since the vintage was released in 2012 and I've been slowly tasting bottles throughout the years, watching what was once a merlot-driven and supple wine from a ripe vintage mature into a savory, complex, and serious bottle of mature Bordeaux. Tasting it today, it's at its most profound position yet. The wine is much leaner than it was a few years back and has shed some of that baby fat, now resembling something with age from St. Emilion or Pomerol. For the price its tough to beat, especially when stacked up against some of the other $20 bargains we have in the store. Few, however, show as much evolution as the Coufran. This is a Wednesday night steak frites wine at its finest.
",Merlot
"We have a few house favorites when it comes to Bordeaux here at K&L, and the 2009 Coufran, Haut-Médoc confirms why we love this property. For the Haut-Medoc, this wine has a huge proportion of Merlot at 85% and just a touch of Cabernet Sauvignon at 15%. In its youth, the wine had a big, ripe, plumy nose, but was still very elegant in the mouth. It reminded me very much of old fashioned Pomerol; medium bodied, pure, racy Merlot without the extraneous sugar and oak. At the price, too much of this wine was probably consumed too young, but the patient will now be rewarded with a great experience at a very small price.
",Merlot
"Old school property making more modern wines these days.  Good value.
",Merlot
"A fine 2015 Bordeaux for $11? Sweet oaky, cassis aromas with sweet blackberry flavors.  So easy to drink, but it will age well for a few years.  Buy cases. Here is you large party red-even California red wine drinkers will love it. Jammy style.
",Merlot
"Another easy going Bordeaux showing a fruity core and lifted aromatics. Good quality for everyday drinking.
",Merlot
"This is filled with sweet and gentle baked red fruit in a soft, caressing style.  The subtle finish of warm cherry seems to linger and expand on this Super Bargain.
",Merlot
"This wine is ready to be enjoyed. Very pleasing, and of a lighter body than what I was expecting. Enticing notes of sweet BBQ sauce, along with mocha, and plum with a touch floral as well.
",Merlot
"This killer value has creamy cherry, vanilla, cocoa and oak flavors and aromas in a silky and easy to drink style.  The mid-palate is smooth and fresh and finishes with very fine tannins.  The vanilla cream flavored 2016 is lush with plenty of structure and should be another super value.
",Merlot
"Moulin a Vent’s 25 hectares of estate vines occupy the highest hill in Moulis.  The soil is mostly volcanic gravel with calcareous clay, making it perfect for Merlot, which makes up about 65% of the blend.  The rest is 30% Cabernet Sauvignon with a little bit of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot.  The 2009 offers supple cherry and cassis fruit with an elegant bouquet and a touch of earth.  This could easily age another ten years.
",Merlot
"Another great value from the superb 2009 Bordeaux vintage. Actually this is the first vintage I have tasted from this property-I loved it and bought it on the spot. 65% Merlot, 30% CS, and 5% CF. Lots of chocolate on the nose that follows to the palate. Quite lush and sweet on the palate. So easy to drink and less than $20. A must buy.
",Merlot
"I visited Luca Sanjust at his winery Petrolo in September 2015 and got to taste his 100% Merlot Galatrona as it was being racked off the skins--it was its first breath as a wine. I knew immediately that this was a tremendous wine: the aromatic purity, saturated flavors, exceptional length just screamed greatness. Even at such a young stage its palate presence was remarkable, such balance, and as the finish approached it just seemed to lift off your tongue at the back; superb length, yet it was a newborn and needed time. Fast forward to September 2016, I was able to taste at James Suckling’s first-ever Tuscan “en primeur” barrel tasting where I tasted close to 50 Super Tuscans from 2015. The 2015 Petrolo Galatrona didn’t disappoint. If you’ve never had Galatrona before and aren’t a fan of California styled Merlot, you’ve not experienced a Merlot like this. The nose, while still evolving, was exceptionally complex, with layers of earth, spice, leather, and bolder berry flavors, but what was most exciting was the floral component: wisps of dried violet and lavender came in at the finish. On the palate the wine was elegant first, so in line, no extra fat; it was sinewy, long, more like a swimmer’s body, supple, long, yet you can sense the power and direction. The flavors were still nascent, yet the fruit was preparing to burst forward. The finish was highlighted by elegance, restrained power; I could feel the tension of evolution that was preparing for the next stage of development within this wine. Galatrona has greatness on the horizon, and a long life ahead. Don’t miss out.
",Merlot
"Ah the little Segonzac... Always a nice appearance on any table. It is all about its Merlot fruit giving enticing aromatics and a very friendly palate. It is ready to be enjoyed.
",Merlot
"The folks at Chateau Segonzac are sticklers for quality. They hand harvest the fruit from the “old vines” and all the grapes are hand sorted once they get to the winery. The careful selection process at Segonzac helps to create concentrated, full flavored wines. The bright, lush fruit is balanced with plenty of ripe tannins. Old school label and very good tasting wine for under $10.
",Merlot
"Lush aromatics of cassis, cocoa, wild berries and vanilla let you know this second wine really is second to none! It has a ""sweet"" palate showing the perfect ripeness of the grapes alongside smoke, blueberry, cinnamon and french vanilla. Rich and complex, this delicious wine is a classic example of what to expect from the excellent 2015 vintage - and I hear the 2016 is even better... Impressive. Really.
",Merlot
"Classic 2015. Don't let the low price scare you away. This reminds me of the 1997 Cantemerle: it drinks great young, but will age (if you can keep your hands off it.) Wild spicy berry and floral character. Full-bodied, with soft tannins. Two Thumbs up !!!
",Merlot
"Another great chance to try the fantastic 2015 vintage. The d'Arce is a pleasing, juicy wine with elegant notes of coffee, cherries, plums, with very velvety tannins.Very versatile and completely drinkable from the get go.
",Merlot
"The 2015 vintage produced plenty of charming, easy to like wines but here’s one that is easy to love. This is primarily Merlot, so it's soft and supple, full of deep red fruits, velvety tannins and energetic acidity. It's structured and balanced, the grapes are hand picked, organic, sustainable and no SO2 was added to preserve the wine. With all this for just $15.99, what's not to love?
",Merlot
"A very recent addition to the stable of Right Bank properties owned and managed by Helene Garcin-Leveque yet her influence is already felt in this charming 2015 Bordeaux blend from the Cotes de Castillon. Quality to rank among the best in the appellation. Sweet ripe fruit and a lush texture in a well-balanced, crowd-pleasing style that will make for superb near to medium term drinking. On y va!
",Merlot
"I love this wine from the Garcin family, the folks behind Barde-Haut and L'Eglise on Bordeaux's Right Bank. It's a perfect expression of everything I enjoy about the 2015 vintage in Bordeaux. The flavors are delicate and fruit-driven, but they're pretty rather than punchy. The red fruits are pure, accented with mineral notes and a core of clean acidity, and the tannins are elegantly structured. We tasted this with Helene Garcin at the property this past Spring and I loved it then, but the wine is really showing its splendor right now. Not only is it delicious, it's also versatile. It's rich enough to pair with beef, but juicy enough for chicken and pork as well. It's a wine I could drink everyday for the price, yet also one that tastes serious enough to bring to a dinner party. It's the type of Bordeaux I never want to be without and it's a fantastic preview of what's to come from 2015. For those of you who want to get your feet wet in the genre, this is a classically-styled wine that delivers serious bang for the buck.
",Merlot
"What a great discovery on that eventful Saturday afternoon at Château Barde Haut with Helene Garcin Leveque. D'Arce is a new property for Helene:7.5 hectares in nearby Castillon planted to 90% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc. The wine emanates with meaty aromas and smoky bacon undertones. The palate is full of sweet black cherry fruit, lush on the finish. The wine tastes so good right now, but it will cellar well for several years. You can have it both ways with the 2015 D'Arce.
",Merlot
"It's certainly a more modern iteration from Bordeaux, but full of pretty red fruit and blueberry notes.  The palate is lush and soft with a lot of fruit up front; it then moves into licorice, dark currant and dried herbs.  The finish is elegant with touch of grip on the back end.  Great little weeknight sipper.
",Merlot
"Dark red fruit mingles with dried mushroom, sage and saddle leather. Quite a brooding wine with a core of sweet fruit but plenty of savory umami qualities to boot. Exotic spicy oak adds another dimension and helps reinforce structure. Beautiful fine, chalky tannin gives length and promise for a long future (if you don't drink it tonight).
",Merlot
"When the Garcin family presented their wines at a K&L dinner a couple months back, I was amazed at the grace and style with which Barde-Haut aged.  The 2014 should be no different: It offers amazing aging potential at great value.  It has great fruit, blackberries, blueberries, black cherries, with toast from the oak regimen and a slightly smoky character with spice that adds complexity and layers.
",Merlot
"Our visit with Hélène Garcin at Chateau Barde-Haut in St-Émilion back in April was meant to be a brief one. It had been a very long day of tasting 2016 barrel samples on the Right Bank, and we had two more appointments still remaining. We tasted samples of all the wines in the portfolio: the two new properties – Chateau d’Arce from the Côtes de Castillon and Poesia in St-Émilion, the fabled Clos l’Eglise from Pomerol, and of course Barde-Haut. In for a penny, in for a pound, and when we were offered barrel samples of the same wines from the excellent 2015 vintage we nodded our assent. The third time’s the charm, so when corks were pulled on the newly bottled wines of the 2014 vintage we held out our glasses once again. It is very difficult to say no to Hélène, and impossible to say no to her wines. The 2014 Barde-Haut, the second vintage produced since its elevation to Grand Cru Classé status, is very much in the Garcin mode, exquisitely polished, the epitome of refinement and grace. Tons of dark fruit, generously seasoned with spicy new oak, and with sufficient structure to more than adequately reward a brief period in the cellar.
",Merlot
"Barde-Haut is usually one of my top five value picks in any vintage, but in 2014 where pretty much the entire harvest itself is a value compared to the higher-priced 15/16 duo, Barde-Haut stands out as a supreme deal: a ""MUST BUY,"" if you ask me. I won't bore you with additional tasting notes about how delicious the wine tastes, rather I'll get straight to the bullet points: 1) You can drink this tonight, or a decade from now, or anytime in between. The suppleness of the fruit is enticing right now, but the wine has both the acidity and the tannic structure for long-term maturation and evolution. Few wines in this price point and with this pedigree offer that type of versatility. 2) The scores here don't lie, and there are few 94 pointers in the sub-$30 category. The Barde-Haut is true-to-form St-Emilion with chalky, mineral typicity underneath all that fruit, for a slam dunk price. 3) This is the ultimate Bordeaux gateway bottle for California drinkers who want to expand their horizons. You get ample fruit from the Merlot, but it's very much a classic Bordeaux claret in style. If you're intrigued by Bordeaux and want to venture into its waters without emptying your wallet, the 2014 Barde-Haut is a great place to start. I bought a case when it landed, and now that I've emptied that case I'm going back in for more.
",Merlot
"A fabulous value from one of the best mid-range priced chateaux in St Emilion.  Helene Garcin Leveque has fashioned a soft, elegant, fruit forward beauty here. Very aromatic and chalky on the nose with blackberries and blackcurrants. Licorice, too. And 94 JS points to boot. Bar none one of the best bangs for your buck in all of Bordeaux. Especially seeing that you can drink it tonight or ten years from now.
",Merlot
"After all these years in retail, one of the many misperceptions by many, many customers that still make me shake my head is how we have a tendency to associate the supposed quality of a wine with its price point. In other words, the higher the price the wine is the better its quality. Recently I had a customer come up to me in the store and ask me what was wrong with this Coufran because  of its cheap price, and I confronted him with why he was thinking in those terms. This notion of higher the price vis-à-vis higher the quality level is Wrong! We have been brainwashed (and I won’t get into by who, which is a whole article in and of itself); I have tasted some absolutely awful $150.00+/- Cabernets the last several years that I wouldn’t even spend $10.00 for, wines that are super high in alcohol, have no acid backbone, and, even worse, have residual sugar left in the finish product. This 2005 Coufran is a prime example of a first-class drinking red wine that is not going to cost you this month’s mortgage or rent payment to purchase a single bottle, and is a showcase for the thousands of excellent wines that are still available at better than reasonable prices in today’s market. Merlot-driven, the color of this Gem is medium-deep ruby with a soft pinkish edge to it, while in its wonderful bouquet you will discover developed, distinctive aromas of cassis, currants, blackberries, and plum-like notes with undertones of cedar, leather, and clove-like spiciness. All of this carries over decisively to a broad, well-integrated, balanced, complex set of aged flavors, with a lush, soft, silky mid-range, that leads to a long, generous, elegant finish. Okay; ask me that question again about what’s wrong with this wine because it is so “cheap.” It is time to change your way of thinking! Rusty has demanded that I bring home several cases of this Gem for consumption over the next five to ten years. AN ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE VALUE!!! >>>A K&L WINE MERCHANTS' DIRECT IMPORT<<< ***** 13.5% ABV *****
",Merlot
"Chateau Coufran produces excellent drinkable wines for a reasonable price. The 2005 is full bodied and structured with dark fruit flavors balanced out with hints of earth. It is dry and well be best with hearty foods.
",Merlot
"Legend has it that one of the previous generations of the Miailhe family was so frustrated by three successive under ripe vintages that he ripped out the estate’s Cabernet vines and planted the easier-ripening Merlot instead.  If the 2005 is any indication, he solved the problem.  It has great density of fruit, smooth pronounced tannins and just the perfect amount of that earthy savoriness that I love in my old Bordeaux.  The years have been good to this wine, and you won’t break the bank trying it.  It would make a great case to have lying around the house.
",Merlot
"Savory and supple textured, this has definitely hit its stride! There’s dry spice, bay leaf, black olive, and cassis flavors here. The fruit shows the low-key character of a mature wine, and has shed the juiciness of its youth. The tannins, while present yet, have calmed down and integrated into the wine, and the finish comes across dry and resinous. This practically screams out for something like herb crusted, rare grilled lamb.
",Merlot
"The merlot dominates this wine, but in the best way possible -- it's fleshy, plumey, but balanced by earth and a little old school Bordeaux funk. Get some before it's gone. This will last a solid decade in your cellar.
",Merlot
"This is a very serious wine that has Rutherford Dust-like aromas and plenty of minerals on the nose. It's a big wine on the palate, full-bodied and tannic, but with great underlying fruit.  Cellar it a bit or decant two hours.
",Merlot
"Deep, firm blackberry and blueberry fruit with good minerality. Direct with very solid structure. Most people will drink wines in this price range young, but this 2005 will age fantastically, so put a few down for the long run. I would decant four hours before drinking now.
",Merlot
"Coufran is north of St-Estèphe, where heavier soils are wellsuited to merlot. The château is planted with 85% merlot and 15% cabernet sauvignon.With a bit ofdecanting this wine really opened up and with each sip I enjoyed it even more. Very dark in color, thenose provides both rich fruit and some oak. It opens with a mix of rich cassis and nice acidity, but itstannins are still astringent. Give this beauty some time to age.
",Merlot
"This is the 2nd wine of the star of the appellation Chateau d'Aiguilhe.  Proprietor Stephan Neipperg is also responsible for the great wines of Canon-la-Gaffeliere, Clor l'Oratoire and the super luxury ""Garage wine"" La Mondotte.  Drinkable now, this elegant Merlot based blend is supple, rich, inviting and one of the best values in Bordeaux.
",Merlot
"The second wine of Aiguilhe is always a great value and 2014 is just that.  Plenty of blackberry aromas and flavors. Decant and enjoy with a nice hamburger.
",Merlot
"I was expecting a very heavy wine, but what I got was a nice, elegant and balanced St-Emilion. It needs a good decanting for its nice dark cherry fruit, figs and cocoa to come to the forefront. Drink it now or age for at least a good 5 years in the cellars.
",Merlot
"We have carried a few vintages of this property over the years--notably the 2000 and the 2005. A blend of 85% Merlot and 15% Cabernet Franc from the limestone plateau of St-Emilion. This wine offers raspberry and black cherry fruit intermixed with licorice and chalky notes.  Very nice wine for the low price.
",Merlot
"This is the last to arrive of our April 2017 tasting trip finds for value. Vinous scores it 90-93 and we agree. Black raspberries abound on the nose and palate. A sort of new wave entry, but fine acid balance is a hallmark of this wine. First time for K&L to carry this beauty-it won't be the last I am sure.I am loving these 2015s.
",Merlot
"Both red and dark fruit as well as a snap if licorice fill the middle of this crisp and easy bargain.  Plenty of ripe fruit and no hard edges make this a perfect bottle to open most any night or even with a light lunch.  Amazing value!
",Merlot
"Here is your Tuesday night hamburger wine, but it will also do well with Thursday night pork roast dinner. Sweet black fruit aromas and flavors — goes down easily. Great wine for California Cabernet lovers. Enjoy young and fruity.
",Merlot
"This property, under the guidance of Nicolas Thienpont, is on a roll.  And it is priced correctly! Huge wine with Blackberry jam flavors. Tons of everything in this package. Acid, tannin, fruit-great aging potential. This is right up their with their 2010 in quality. I tend to enjoy these right bank 2015s more than most left bankers.
",Merlot
"Along with Larcis Ducasse the 2015 Pavie Macquin is one of the more elegant St. Emilion's out there. With incredible purity of fruit nicely mingled against a hint of oak and zippy minerality this is a beautiful wine that has a Burgundian feel while still having a Bordelaise sensibility.
",Merlot
"very attractive nose of fresh berries, followed by an medium-body palate with soft tannins, along cassis, and even a touch of chocolate milk. Quite approachable and a delight to drink now.
",Merlot
"I love this merlot! Satisfies the ""deep and brooding"" craving very well. It boats a dark color and an intense kitchen spiciness, like meatloaf in the oven or something slow cooking in the Dutch oven. Would pair amazingly with these dishes, by the way. The spicy and long finish make you sit back and feel very happy with your wine and food choices.
",Merlot
"After tasting a line up of Merlot dominant Bordeaux wines, I tasted the Shafer Napa Merlot. While both are merited in their own right, they are both extremely unique.. The Shafer Merlot was bold with ripe plums and fresh purple flowers. The palate is concentrated and deep with black berry and baking spice. A hint of soft tannin structure keep the wine focused and complex. It is not a wine to be trifle with, but a wine demanding respect and your full attention.
",Merlot
"Still a big California wine, the 2014 Shafer Merlot also shows a bit of a soft side. It is a lush, well-oaked and rich wine that coats the mouth with flavors of plums, spice and mocha flavors. The finish is long and supple. Blended with a large percentage of Malbec (14%) and some Cabernet, this is a really nice pick to enjoy with some air or lay down for a few years!
",Merlot
"In the 1980's, Merlot was the wine that put Shafer on the map and they've continued to beautifully craft this wine vintage after vintage. Shafer's 2014 Merlot is a flavorful, concentrated wine composed of 78% Merlot, 14% Malbec and 8% Cabernet Sauvignon. Rich aromatics of dark chocolate, plum, vanilla and wet gravel fill the glass and finishes with soft tannins. Give this Merlot a few years in the cellar and you'll surely be happy with this one!
",Merlot
"Helene Garcin Leveque has transformed this beautiful estate’s winemaking facility to state of the art, and the wines clearly reflect this. This wine features flashy, beautiful Merlot fruit with some toasty oak.A fruit-forward vintage and a delicious wine.
",Merlot
"I was worried that the freshness might have left St. Emilion- trampled by points and pundits. Luckily, this very well balanced Barde Haut is proof that refreshing purity can still be found on the right bank of the river. This sweet fruited, pure, plummy Bordeaux will drink well with an hour in the decanter and a skirt steak now, or for many years into the future.
",Merlot
"An impressive Pomerol, full bodied for sure, but it is never heavy. In fact it has a quite lifted nose. It is balanced and absolutely enjoyable now.
",Merlot
"This Pomerol is nuanced and expansive, with very spicy aromatics trailed by sage and Ylang Ylang. The palate blooms with ripe blueberry and blackberry, and the tannin structure is soft and fine. The 2015 Bel Air Pomerol is a wine that can absolutely be enjoyed tonight, but will also age beautifully for at least a decade.
",Merlot
"Super value here in a serious wine.  This is ripe and juicy with so much cocoa infused cherry fruit that you won't notice the structure holding it all together.  Drink this bargain now or lay a few bottles away for a few years and be impressed.
",Merlot
"Always a house favorite here at K&L, the 2014 Gigault shows bright, pure red fruits. There is typically a poise and freshness to this wine when it is young, though allied with a classic vintage like 2014 it becomes all the more notable. Also worth mentioning is the fact that this wine - delicious as it is to drink now - ages quite nicely in the mid-term. Best value Bordeaux under $15? I think the answer is an emphatic 'Yes.""
",Merlot
"The second wine of Bellefont Belcier is very tasty right now. Beautiful aromas of flowers, fresh herbs and dark fruits. Full-bodied, with lovely fruit, super well-integrated tannins and a polished, creamy-textured mouthfeel.  Easy to drink right now.
",Merlot
"When we're out visiting Bordeaux to taste the most recent vintage (like 2016), we're usually taking notes for the eventual pre-order campaign that follows. But sometimes we head out to visit producers and negociants and taste older vintages that are usually in bottle and ready to go. One such example is the recently arrived 2014 Château Hyot, a property located in Saint-Magne-de-Castillon that provided us with one helluva sub-$15 option. With its forty year old vines, the concentration of the Merlot (which makes of 70% of the blend) is stunning, adding a plummy lushness to the coffee notes imparted by the oak, and bolstered by the structure from the remaining 20% Cabernet Franc and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon. The wine is made by the Aubert family, one that has been living in the region for almost three hundred years. Amélie Aubert, who took over from her parents, is a seventh-generation winemaker with a special sense of how to tend the vines planted in both clay and gravel soils; she's made her mark with the 2014 expression, for sure. I've not made any secret of my affinity for 2014 with its classic, yet approachable flavors and even more attractive price points (especially when compared to the higher costs of '15/'16), and personally I'm always on the hunt for the next great Tuesday night Bordeaux—for those nights when I just want to pop something delicious, warm up my leftovers, and put my feet up in front of the TV. I love how the wine evolved over time, showing more than just oak and fruit with nuances of minerality like graphite and iron once it got some air into it. We kept going back to the wine later in the day to see how it evolved and we all agreed it tasted better after it had been open a few hours, so if you can decant it you'll be doing yourself a favor.
",Merlot
"Clyde has done it again: found another incredible value in Bordeaux. I can't remember enjoying a Right Bank vintage as much as 2014 since at least 1998. This shares the virtues of many of the more expensive wines from 2014 that I have tasted. While the Hyot is dark, loaded with flashy coffee and plummy fruit on the nose, it is medium bodied, and has very good lift on the long finish. This Cotes De Castillon is ideal for mid-week meals!
",Merlot
"There is an overlay of toast to this spicy and juicy gem which  delivers way above its price point.  There is a modern touch to the gobs of dark fruit but the balancing acidity and fine tannic structure lend length and a touch of precision and proportion.  This is a great food or cocktail wine to buy by the case.
",Merlot
"Bright flavors of bramble, black raspberry, spice, violets, leather and oak.  Very smooth tannic profile and enough acid for structure and freshness. It's tasting great now, but in 5 to 10 years it will be singing!
",Merlot
"Chateau Hyot is located in the commune of Saint-Magne-de-Castillon adjacent to its more famous neighbor, Saint-Emilion. Its 40 hectares run from the lower slopes of the Côtes to the river Dordogne with soil types ranging from clay to sand and gravel. The vineyards are planted 70% to Merlot, 20% to Cabernet Franc, and 10% to Cabernet Sauvignon. Average vine age is 35 years. The 2014 Hyot, Côtes de Castillon is very typical of the vintage, combining lively acidity with admirable sweetness of fruit. The nose is lightly floral with hints of oak spice. On the palate, ripe red and black fruits with notes of cherry and plum, very fresh and juicy. Finishes firm with fine tannins. An exceedingly drinkable weeknight claret at a very affordable price.
",Merlot
"A knockout that we had tasted in January 2017, but we did not know who dropped off the sample.  So we found it again on our April Bordeaux tasting and bought it on the spot. The cotes de castillon region is where you can still fine bargains in Bordeaux. This wine has a spicy, toasty aroma and the palate is all black cherry and black licorice.  Superb balance and quite elegant for 2014-drinks perfectly right now.  Buy cases.  It has some great scores also.
",Merlot
"I was blown about by the 2014 Tourelles De Longueville. I tasted in a line-up with other '14s that were over twice the price and it outperformed all of them. Gorgeous nose with earth and savory notes. Dark fruited with powerful acidity that I've found totally characteristic of the '14 vintage. Structured, yet accessible, this is one of the clear standouts of the '14 vintage at its price point.
",Merlot
"This is ""one"" of the 2nd wines of Pichon Baron and although done in a richer and more approachable style still has the qualitative stamp of that great property.  Sweet blackberry fruit, pencil shavings and a savory hint all done up with the sense of balance and proportion you expect but with a touch more Merlot richness to round things out.
",Merlot
"Few wines express more clearly the incredible quality of the 2014 vintage in Bordeaux than this estate label from Chateau Pichon Baron in Pauillac. No longer strictly a second wine with the introduction of “Les Griffons” in 2012, most of the fruit for “Les Tourelles” comes from a single plot. The blend is weighted more to Merlot than Cabernet, producing a more accessible style that is meant to be drunk sooner than the Grand Vin. Elegant and polished, of obvious pedigree, the wine offers sweet, ripe red fruits lightly seasoned with oak spice. Well-balanced and marked by lively acidity and fine tannins. Exceptional quality here. A true value.
",Merlot
"This wine is really NOT the second wine of Pichon-Baron, but rather a separate plot of mainly Merlot grapes.  The wine tends to be more feminine than the Baron and this one is sweet and lovely. Blackberry fruit flavors in a region known for red fruit flavors. Plummy and lush. Decant and enjoy.
",Merlot
"This is deep and toasty with ripe black currant fruit, espresso roast and licorice snap flavors melding together gloriously.  The mid-palate is fat and textured  and there is a long, mineral infused finish of roasted herb and ripe, sweet tannin.  This is an outstanding bottle to drink or age.
",Merlot
"Another success for this bargain priced property that is pushing quality to new levels vintage after vintage.  There is wonderful purity to the vanilla laced blueberry fruited middle that is layered and expressive.  Tons of mineral character here with just the right amount of tannin.  This barrel sample was ready to take home and drink.
",Merlot
"From 20 hectares of terraced vineyards on clay limestone soils in the commune of Saint-Christophe-des-Bardes near Chateau Barde-Haut. 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc. Harvest quite late here in 2016 beginning on October 5th with the Merlot and finishing on October 23rd with the last of the Cabernet Franc. Fruit very sweet and ripe and a bit forward at 14.8% alc. Still, a supremely balanced effort overall sure to please many palates. Tannins are quite firm though very fine in keeping with the vintage. Quality is very high here with no expense spared. Very polished effort. Excellent value.
",Merlot
"Just like last year, but perhaps a bit better?  Pure and precise. 20% new oak. Fresh and lively aromas of boysenberry that follow to palate. Lots of mineral from the limestone and clay soil.  Outstanding value. These guys are on a roll.
",Merlot
"A pleasure to drink already. Lots of dark cherries, kirsch, vanilla, dark chocolate and a touch of meat. Needs decanting.
",Merlot
"One of the new stars in Bordeaux--their wines are lush and fruit-forward.  The '12 is full of blackberry fruit flavors and toasty oak.  Great value.  Decant one hour before drinking.
",Merlot
"More richness and precsion here.  Blackberry jam.. Sweet and sexy. Another winner here.
",Merlot
"Canon La Gaffiliere- 55%M 40CF 5% CS This is a strong CLG with elegance!. Penetrating red fruit, very precise and focused with firm structure. Needs at least 10 years. 2 Stars!
",Merlot
"**One of the wines of the vintage** Exotic, black fruits with truffle and mineral, beautifully layered then opening on the palate with an amazing core of dense, sweet fruit and flesh.  The supreme mouthfeel and minute long finish are absolutely incredible.  Tasted en primeur, the team was in awe as the finish just kept going. Stunning.
",Merlot
"Along with 2010 Petrus and a few others, this could be one of the greatest wines I have ever tasted out of barrel. In the mouth the wine is so rich, polished and lush that it practically melts into you. Hints of cedar, cola and black currants are followed by a long, sweet and spicy finish that last for at least a minute.  A blend of 84% Merlot and 16% Cabernet Franc, this wine has a nearly perfect balance between power and finesse. Wow!
",Merlot
"We tasted this wine multiple times at the chateau on our trip and every sip just got better and better. There's a pop of plump fruit on the initial sip and then it moves into beautiful notes of violets and dark earth before enveloping itself in its own tannic structure. This is a great cellar wine and one of my favorites from our St. Emilion selections.
",Merlot
"A fantastic value from Nicolas Thienpont.  60% Merlot.  Very spicy and sexy on the palate.  Right up there with their 2009.
",Merlot
"Wow! Powerful and fairly tannic wine that needs some years in your cellar. Licorice and gingerbread aromas with blackberry fruit flavors. Super structure and balance. Another solar vintage but more apparent power on the palate. 80% Merlot
",Merlot
"One of the better value properties in St-Emilion. Fruity and forward, this wine begs to be drunk with a nice piece of prime rib.  I will never forget the mindblowing 1970 vintage from them. (Clyde Beffa Jr., K&L)This wine is at about its peak for drinking. No hard edges just lots of plummy, black fruit flavors.
",Merlot
"I actually liked this wine better than their 2010 or 2012 (last vintage at Arrosee).  It has fine structure and plenty of blackberry and spice on the nose and palate.
",Merlot
"A sumptous, nuanced and elegant Merlot from one of California's best producers. Those who have tasted Ridge's other offerings are familiar with their focus and quality of fruit, but this Merlot is outstanding in the portfolio. Unfolding flavors and aromas of dark chocolate, black cherry, cassis and mountain blackberry are balanced by an elegant acidity and a fine grained yet very present tannin. The overall impression of this wine is it is plush, yet restrained, and is certainly ready to drink now, but will also age nicely for those who like to cellar.
",Merlot
"I believe the Ridge Merlot is one of the most understated and possibly under-appreciated wines in the winery's Estate lineup. Wine-drinkers unfortunately often have a stigma against Merlot, especially from California, but it is truly a noble grape with so much potential. This wine reminds me of some of the best Right Bank Bordeaux I've tasted, though with elements entirely its own. The wine is dark, luscious and silky, with velvety tannins and elegant, perfumed aromas. However, it certainly does not lack for structure, and, like its French counterparts, will absolutely benefit from some time in the cellar.
",Merlot
"Here come the great Right Bank 2015s. This bad boy is bright and lively--a great buy for $15.  This 50,000-bottle cuvee of 100% Merlot, coming largely from Fronsac, is fashioned by Jean-Luc Thunevin, the bad boy of St-Emilion.  It is a new wave style wine--fresh and spicy with some oak evident.  The bad boy refers to Robert Parker they say, not Mr Thunevin.
",Merlot
"There won’t be any 2017-big frost here. Sweet and spicy-always a good choice on the right bank.
",Merlot
"The 2015 Berliquet is a blend of 75% Merlot and 25% Cabernet Franc. The brilliant Nicolas Thienpont makes this wine (and owns the property) along with other great right bankers like Larcis Ducasse, Pavie macquin, Beausjour Duffau, etc.This wine is so good right now-bright and lively and forward.  Round tannins and black currant fruit aromas that follow to palate. Stunning value.
",Merlot
"Very attractive fruit, not overdone in any way, very pure with nice balance. This wine is from the talented team of Nicolas Thienpont and Stephane Derenoncourt and may well end up being one of the right bank's best values.
",Merlot
"Soft and sweet-fruited with lush cherry and other red berries notes. This will probably taste great no matter when you open it!
",Merlot
"I can’t get enough of these 2009s-another one has just arrived.  We loved this wine in the early ‘70s and it has reappeared. We love it again. Elegant, ripe, plumy and totally satisfying wine to enjoy now.
",Merlot
"Petit Figeac is definitely a wine for those who appreciate a balanced wine that although soft it does deliver a complex and well integrated experience. I appreciated that very much.
",Merlot
"I really enjoyed getting the chance to taste older vintages from the Right Bank, especially from properties that no longer exist! L'Arrosee was purchased in 2013 by Haut Brion who merged the vineyards with Tetre-Daugay and called the new estate Quintus. Those who like their old school Bordeaux, both in historical and flavorful sense of the word, will really dig this. The flavors are savory with plenty of secondary development and soft tannins that flesh out on the finish.
",Merlot
"Elegant side here. Just tons of plum and black fruits.  Tastes great right now.
",Merlot
"This is more lifted and fresher than usual for this property with lively red fruit flavors along side the more expected chocolate and mocha.  The middle is deep and rich with a creamy texture that runs straight into the big, grainy tannins on the powerful finish.  This is a lot of wine for the money very much in the Angelus style.
",Merlot
"Outstanding value wine that is as good as their excellent 2015. Very focused wine with tons of sweet, ripe fruit.  Very well-balanced and easy to taste.
",Merlot
"Boysenberry jam on toast. Their best effort.
",Merlot
"Chateau Canon is back on top! This graceful, balanced St. Emilion will repay time in your cellar in spades. I love the dark fruit and the seamless texture of this elegant right bank wine. The best part is the quality of the concentration, rather than making for heavy going, the acidity is as concentrated as the fruit, and the wine has a finish that I can almost still taste now. Make room in your cellar!
",Merlot
"Very spicy, oaky, flashy style.  A bit modern I would say.  Tastes good!
",Merlot
"I found this wine to be like a New World Pomerol. There’s the spirit of the Old World in the blend, especially when I got the fresh-rolled cigars, herbs and cassis on the nose. I found bold flavors of spicy, dark plums on the palate, yet it has enough acidity and structure to keep it balanced. The fine tannins just made the long finish more enjoyable.
",Merlot
"Under the leadership of the Cathiard family of Smith Haut Lafitte, this property is making great value wines—they have the excellent terroir for red wines and, in fact, pulled all the white grapes out.
",Merlot
"One of the great bargains for the appellation and a killer wine in its own right.  This is dark and serious with layers of sweet blueberry fruit, limestone shadings and gravely grip on the finish,  A complete and easy to like wine.
",Merlot
"22 hectares of vines in a mix of clay limestone and sand and gravel soils. Major improvements here recently to bolster the already high quality of the wines. Vinification is by parcel in small, conical steel tanks. Barrel aging with 35% new. 90% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc. Rich and round with very sweet, ripe fruit. 14.5% alc. Finishes very fine.
",Merlot
"Great value here.  Coffee and tea aromas with some black fruit underneath. A powerhouse on the palate, but so sweet and lush. Very round tannins.
",Merlot
"**One of the wines of the vintage** Penetrating color.  Dense and rich with a pure core of black and blue fruit, damson plum preserve, perfume, and light earth.  This is so sumptuous on the palate, silky, and long without being cloying or overdone.  This is special.
",Merlot
"This is just PERFECT Napa Merlot. Classic, solid, elegant, pleasurable drinkable delicious Merlot. Everything is there nothing more nothing less. In such a stupendous vintage like 2013 it's important to identify the great sleeper wines. This is without a doubt one of them.
",Merlot
"2015 Troplong Mondot shows a rich, ripe and nearly exotic fruit character that is touched with a hint of toasty oak and chocolate. The mouth is broad and concentrated. This will be a good wine for mid-term cellaring!
",Merlot
"Extremely limited production for this tiny 6 hectare estate-perfect terroir and fantastic winemaking. A Nicolas Thienpont wine that is so spicy on the nose and flavor. Exotic wine with enough stuffing for many years in the cellar.  A lot of wine for the reasonable price.
",Merlot
"From a single vineyard more than 75 years old, located exclusively in the village of Saint Christophe des Bardes on limestone soil.  Neighbors include Barde Haut and Tour St-Christophe. Only 3,000 bottles produced and only in the best years.Very spicy aromas that follow to the palate. Very full and rich wine with tons of black fruit flavors. A very powerful, young, yet delicious wine.  Will cellar well and provide great enjoyment in five years. I highly recommend it.
",Merlot
"**One of the wines of the vintage** Incredible purity, rich and deep with a smooth core of black fruits, cassis, purple flowers, and chalky minerality from the limestone plateau.  Intense, layered, and full bodied on the palate yet with restraint and tension. Very fine and all class.

"One of the best of the 2015 vintage. Fresh, pure, elegant.  Black raspberry flavors and a long finish.  Bravo!
",Merlot
"Canon- 72%M 28CF You have to go all the way back to 1982 to find a Ch. Canon that rivals this wine. In 2015 Canon takes its place alongside VCC, and La Consiellante as the greatest wines of elegance in 2015. Beautiful red fruit with spice, rich middle fruit in perfect harmony and a super clean dry finish.  This is a complete wine with great freshness, perfect extraction and by no means sweet. This is a great dry wine, without huge opulent fruit that is all the rage theses days, it is all about perfect balance; a mirror image of the legendary 1982. 3 Stars
",Merlot
"72% Merlot and 28% Cabernet Franc, this wine is toasty upfront with lots of red currants and red cherry fruit, a seamless mid-palate and a long spicy finish. This wine has a lot of finesse and elegance. Great purity and precision!
",Merlot
"This wine has a perfect balance between opulence and finesse that is hard to describe. The tannins are quite present even though enveloped by lush flavors of chocolate, plums and vanilla, which suggests that a longer term in the cellar may benefit the wine.
",Merlot
"The 2009 Clinet sold for $350 on the shelf. The 2012 expression is going for $79.99. If pressed, I'd take the subtle nuance and the graceful beauty of the 2012 over the big fruit and power of the 2009. While 2009 is my favorite Bordeaux vintage of the last ten years, I can't afford many of the high prices. What 2012 offers is a chance to get in on the ground floor for once---AND DON'T THINK YOU'RE SETTLING FOR LESS BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT. This wine is the real deal, loaded with red fruits, a bit of tobacco leaf from the Merlot, and an wonderfully integrated finish with delicate tannic structure. This is a chance to actually add Clinet to your cellar rather than dream about drinking it from behind the glass window.
",Merlot
"If you’re a fan of Pomerol then you owe it to yourself to check out the 2012 Chateau Clinet Pomerol. Always a consistent performer this year they have lapped the field with a broad-shouldered wine loaded with a sexy nose of cherry-kirsch, dark fruit and baker’s chocolate. The palate is a densely wound core of purple fruits, blackberry and blackcurrants with hints of molten earth and spice. Loaded with fine tannins and nice oak accents this wine is flat-out delicious!!
",Merlot
"**One of the wines of the vintage**   Inky color.  Saturated and seamless with a massive core of pure Merlot fruit (100%).   Concentrated and full on the palate with dark plum, black cherry, earth, violets, and mineral.  This wine has such scale and depth on the palate yet is deftly balanced on the incredibly long and mouthwatering finish.  The breed and pedigree are apparent with the fruit being sourced from vines in front of Clinet and next to Fleur-Petrus.  3,000 bottles.
",Merlot
"Barrel tasted April 9, 2016: Very deep and dark in color; dense, highly extracted with black, chewy fruits, hints of roasted coffee and mocha flavors, not over done and does manage to maintain balance. This is really serious win. Buy for sure!
",Merlot
"Must be at least 100 points from me. This property is new to us and is only one hectare in size - one part next to LaFleur Petrus and the other part in front of Clinet. Only 3,000 bottles produced and on my top 10 of the vintage. Powerful blackberry aromas-very intense and almost jammy on the palate but perfectly balanced-lush so that you want to drink it now. 100% Merlot. Tons of mineral on the minute-long finish. Wow!
",Merlot
"This wine knocked my socks off. This is serious Pomerol on every level, deeply concentrated with a brooding note of dark red fruit. The palate is lithe and supple, elegant really, with perfect balance between the ripeness of the fruit and the mineral notes from the terroir. Enclos Tourmaline's vineyards are between Le Pin & Trotanoy, serious names in the Bordeaux hierarchy. This is top-tier wine.
",Merlot
"Fabulous sample, this comes from a small property that sits next to famed Le Pin and Trotanoy and adjacent to Lafleur-Petrus and La Violette. If you can't afford the tariff for these producers this is a great fall back. Immediately upon tasting I thought of Petrus stylistically before I knew the vineyard's proximity to greatness in Pomerol. The wine is super-sexy with exotic notes of black tea, Asian spice and black licorice. Loaded with velvety tannins this is a blockbuster in the making and a stunning wine. If you're a fan of Pomerol this is a wine to buy.
",Merlot
"One of our favorite right bankers for the last six years. Perfectly balanced and not overdone at all. Brambly, blackberry flavors.  Great structure, but the massive amounts of fruit hide the tannins.
",Merlot
"This wine shows you all the flashy, attractive merlot fruit and oak you could ever want without spending hundreds of dollars! Definitely new world-international in style and just flat-out delicious!
",Merlot
"Lots of spicy red fruits, forward and silky in the mid-palate with ripe crunchy tannins on the finish. Very fresh and lively wine that is not overdone. Lovely balance.
",Merlot
"This wine showcases all that silky, soft St. Emilion fruit on the initial entry, but turns into a structured and tannic tour de force on the finish. This is a great cellar candidate from the Right Bank. I think five to ten years should pay huge dividends.
",Merlot
"Black cherry aromas and flavors. Could be their best-maybe better thean their great 2010.  This wine is focused and precise.  The Bernard magrez wines are very well-priced these past few years and the wines are much better balanced-not overdone at all.  Bravo to their teams.
",Merlot
"I expect this to once again be one of the great values in Saint Emilion.  This is filled with toasty cocoa Merlot richness  in the plush middle.  There is a nice chalky tension to all the chocolate infused dark fruits and the overall freshness keeps this ample wine reserved and precise.  The substantial tannins are buried for now but provide excellent grip.
",Merlot
"As good as their 2015? Exotic aromas of Asian spice and tobacco. Serious wine for the long haul. Sexy and ripe.
",Merlot
"This is rich, flashy and dense showing wonderful sweetness to the core of intense fruit and powerful grip on the ripe finish.  There is a meaty and roasted quality to this full throttle wine.
",Merlot
"This wine is rarely one of my favorites, but for the 2015 vintage the Bourgneuf seems to be hitting on all cylinders! A blend of 90% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc, it shows a dark purple color, with tons of red and black fruits and hints of savory herbs and smoke. A nice wine that should be approachable young!
",Merlot
"An impressive Bourgneuf, loaded with deep berry fruit, pepper and spice. Good length and energy, this is easily the best Bourgneuf I have ever tasted from barrel.
",Merlot
"If you’re looking for something a little more old school and less fruit-forward, then the 2015 Bourgneuf is the wine for you. There was more pronounced oak on the palate that will need to integrate over the next five years and a dustiness to the tannins that helped balance the lush fruit. This is a wine that should evolve beautifully over the next decade; a real cellar candidate.
",Merlot
"A winner here-as good as their 1970?  Easy drinking.
",Merlot
"A Peter Kwok wine, this Pomerol is delicious. Very round and supple on the palate while still very concentrated on the back palate. Lovely value of the vintage!
",Merlot
"From a total of 3.18 hectares spread over nine plots west and north of the main plateau of Pomerol on clay and fine gravel soils. Six parcels around the Chateau itself near Chateau Rouget, Clinet and Latour à Pomerol, and an additional three near Chateau Montviel and Clos René. The 2016 vintage is a blend of 85% Merlot and 15% Cabernet Franc. Very sweet fruit, ripe and richly textured. A full-bodied effort, at the higher end for the vintage at 14.5% alc. 30% new oak adds a bit of spice. Fine tannins frame the finish. Terrific value.

"Flashy, new wave style-fat and lush.

"Minty, blueberry aromas.  One of their best ever? Elegant with no hard edges. Superb value.
",Merlot
"Off the charts here-top ten of the vintage-we saved the best for last. A must buy.
",Merlot
"70% Merlot and 30% Cab Franc. Soft and elegant. Unctuous with tons of black fruits on the palate.
",Merlot
"One of my favorite properties in the early days of my wine collecting.  Heck, I bought 5 cases of the 1970.  This one is worth a try. One of the best vintages ever in Bordeaux.
",Merlot
"Bernard Magrez has another winner here. Oaky and spicy, but in perfect balance. A sweet, new wave entry that needs a year or two in the cellar.
",Merlot
"Here is a flashy, rich but balanced bargain filled with flavors and aromas of cocoa, espresso, black raspberry, vanilla and oak in a big, modern style.  The structure here is blanketed by masses of creamy, toasty fruit in this hard to resist youngster.  From the folks at Chateau Pape Clement.
",Merlot
"Nice spice here. Long and lingering. Bright and delicious wine
",Merlot
"Ultra spicey with tobacco aromas-super sweet on the palate.  Velvety

"”Pure nose of deep, old vine Merlot, strong sweetness and structure, deep raspberry fruit, powerful and lush with great concentration and persistence throughout the long finish. Great, great, wine! 3 Stars.""    Ralph Sands

"Deeply colored and very aromatic notes of blackcherry and toasty oak.  Big wine-good mouthfeel. Perfect balance.

"The first thing to know about La Conseillante is that a number of its vineyards lie between Vieux Chateau Certan, Cheval Blanc, and Petrus, three of the absolute best Right Bank sites for Merlot. The second thing to know is that the wine has always been expensive because of its stellar reputation, even back in the mid-1700s when the wines of Pomerol weren't anywhere near as prestigious as they are today. My favorite Bordeaux writer Stephen Brook once wrote that La Conseillante is ""quintessential Pomerol, offering vinous hedonism while rarely straying into overripeness or lack of finesse."" He also describes older vintages as truffle-y in their aroma and flavor. All of those things are on display in the 1986: finesse, truffles, and hedonistic splendor. Along with iron, and a savory meatiness that pairs exquisitely with a steak, this is luxury Bordeaux drinking at its finest.
",Merlot
"Smoky nose and flavors. Sexy on the palate. Fine balance. Will need some time but very good effort.
",Merlot
"Deep and fleshy dark fruits alongside warm cocoa and a hint of vanilla is sure to reel in anybody looking for a bold wine. The palate shows come roasted coffee, a touch of anise, and a long, complex, and interesting finish. Before i knew the price, i pinned it to be a higher price point.
",Merlot
"Barrel tasted April 9, 2016: Dark color, aromatic fresh nose, tons of fruit in the mouth with a round velvety texture. The finish is long and spicy. This wine shows great finesse and opulence.  Excellent!
",Merlot
"This wine has an intensely aromatic nose of cassis and dark raspberry with a mouthful of juicy fruit balanced by great acidity. The tannins were gritty and chewy on the finish, and the flavors were overall fresh and satisfying. We all thought this was a great deal at the chateau, and I'm excited that value wines like the Haut Brisson are part of the 2015 vintage en primeur launch. A case of this is likely going into my cellar as well.
",Merlot
"Surely one of the great values of the 2015 vintage. 90% Merlot and 10% Cab Franc.  There is no longer a Haut Brisson Reserve-this is the only wine they make. No wonder it is so good. Fabulous black fruit aromas that follow to the palate. Plenty of structure for aging but a sweet core of fruit.  All this for under $25? Can't miss.
",Merlot
"Beautiful red cherry fruit with cinnamon notes and hints of spice. The fruit here has a crunchy feel because of how fresh it is thanks to the good acidity. The finish is a tad exotic with notes of mocha and oatmeal on the finish.
",Merlot
"If you're looking for a bottle of Bordeaux to drink right now, this delivers with some decanting. Notes of fresh-roasted coffee, orange zest, spice and mesquite complement a palate packed with gamey black fruit, espresso and tobacco notes on the finish.
",Merlot
"Intense and lavish aromatics of cassis, cocoa, smokey mesquite BBQ, meat and bacon as well. It is rich, it is lush, the fruit quite sweet, yet it has structure and balance. Really quite delicious.
",Merlot
"The great solar vintage really shines bright here. Toasty oak and vanilla aromas. So opulent with great spice and lively acidity—Blackberries abound.
",Merlot
"This is a powerful with huge tannins and very concentrated. Age worthy is an understatement easily capable of 20 years. Bright heady red and black fruit on the nose along with chocolate and macerated plums. The ripe dense fruit is layered with an plenty of baking spices and dark chocolate with the long finish showing an underlying almost chalky minerality.
",Merlot
"This is a rich, modern Bordeaux. The nose is dominated by ripe, dark fruit and toasty oak. On the palate its rich black raspberry fruit is almost liqueur like. The astringent wood tannins dry out the finish a little, but the black raspberry lingers. This is a big, age-worthy St-Emilion for only $40.
",Merlot
"Loaded with dark blackberry notes this wine is rich and full-bodied with tobacco and earth notes. A classic old-world Pomerol in the making.
",Merlot
"This was one of the better deals I tasted from Pomerol. The Lafleur-Gazin coated my palate with plush purple fruits, but finished dry and fine on the back end. It’s the kind of wine that gives Merlot a good name; a wine that’s almost too delicious to wait on. I’ll be interested to see how it develops though. These Pomerol wines have tiny production levels (compare the 21 acres of Lafleur-Gazin to the roughly 160 of Latour). I find it's best to grab these first during the pre-arrival campaign as they're the most likely to sell through.
",Merlot
"A very balanced wine. It has a lush fruit profile full of dark berries, plums, and attractive floral aromatics, along with a gentle herbal note that I found extremely enticing. Its velvety tannins adds even more appeal to this lush but definitely not over the top Lalande-de-Pomerol.
",Merlot
"Black cherry aromas and flavors-has some tannin on the back.
",Merlot
"An absolutely overachiever this wine. A palate with lots of complexity, with notes that run the spectrum from the beautiful Jasmin scent, to blood orange, incense and exotic spices. A premium bottle.
",Merlot
"For some reason, I always feel just a little bit sorry for La Conseillante. It seems to get overlooked by our customers in the rush to the more glam Pauillac and Margaux. However, this brilliant effort from Pomerol is, in reality, always a pleasure.  This 2014 has a bright, raspberry/bing cherry nose with gobs of minerals.  A bit more dense, though still not heavy, on the tongue, with slightly darker cherry fruit, boysenberries, and red plums. Long, bright, finish. Very, very, elegant. I try to get older bottlings of this for the SF store ""Jewel Rack"" as it ages very well. This bridesmaid usually outshines the bride!
",Merlot
"This great La Conseillante harkens back to a time before Pomerol became a land of giant wines. Is it concentrated- of course, and fabulously so, with the balancing acidity to carry off the ample amount of rich plummy fruit in the middle. This is the longest finishing, most intriguing La Conseillante I have tasted since the great 1982!
",Merlot
"Aromatic nose, round and lush fruit, juicy texture with hints of mocha and black cherries; Easy to taste- soft and fleshy! This was one of the first wines we tasted on our first full day so I was a bit unsure of my notes. Luckily we tasted it several more times and I enjoyed it every time. A winner in 2015!
",Merlot
"This François Mitjavile's wine always benefits from 3-4 years in bottle,but the 2015 is very tempting.By far the best Bourg wine made. Only 300 cases make it to the USA
",Merlot
"Another perfect score for value in 2016 and you will see almost no 2017 as 90% of the crop was lost in the April 27th freeze.  Helene Garcin Leveque's new project is a smashing success-three vintages in a row. 90% Merlot and 10% CF. All my notes say is ""so sweet and sexy-lovely texture on the palate.  Enjoy young and often.""  Enough said--this is even better than their 2014 and 2015.
",Merlot
"Côtes de Castillon continues to be a source for some of the best values on the Right Bank. Many top producers in Saint-Emilion and Pomerol have invested in properties within this neighboring appellation, making wines which are nearly equal in quality to their best labels at a fraction of the price. Hélène Garcin, owner of Chateau Clos l'Église in Pomerol and Chateau Barde-Haut and the new Poesia in St-Emilion, now owns Chateau d’Arce in Côtes de Castillon. 2016 is only her third vintage, but certainly the best vintage yet. The quality is already apparent here. Loads of bright, sweet fruit. Very fresh with fine tannins. Terrific balance. Exceptional value.
",Merlot
"2016 L' Evangile is just loaded with big, sweet dark fruit with great purity. Silky smooth texture on the palate with a super-long finish! This is fabulous wine and right there with Petrus, which is a bit firmer. 3 stars!
",Merlot
"Open, elegant nose of blackcherry.  Opulent on the palate. Lots of cinnamon and chocolate on the palate. Lovely wine!
",Merlot
"One of my top ten values of the vintage under $30 retail. I remember buying 5 cases of their 1970 in 1974--it was delicious and $5.  Well, the 2015 is quite good also. You might want to try the 2005 now in stock, but this wine is much better. This wine is packed with blackberry aromas and flavors--so lush and forward you could drink it tonight! Lovely wine in perfect balance with acidity under all that fruit.
",Merlot
"Fabulous wine with a very spicy nose and tons of fruit on the palate. Long and lingering.  A truly great wine only surpassed by Trotanoy in this line-up.
",Merlot
"We missed tasting this, but we heard from very good sources that the wine is as good as 2015 and that is saying a lot.  Great Pomerol for under $40? Tough to beat.
",Merlot
"Big chunky wine with lots of sweet blackberry flavors.
",Merlot
"85% merlot, 10% Sab Franc, 5% Cab Sauv. An outstanding second wine that is smooth and elegant on the palate. Very sweet with a long finish.  How come these wines taste so good so soon? Excellent buy and value.

"I visited Luca Sanjust at his winery Petrolo in September 2015 and got to taste his 100% Merlot Galatrona as it was being racked off the skins--it was its first breath as a wine. I knew immediately that this was a tremendous wine: the aromatic purity, saturated flavors and exceptional length just screamed greatness. Even at such a young stage its palate presence was remarkable, such balance, and as the finish approached it just seemed to lift off your tongue at the back; superb length, yet it was a newborn and needed time. Fast forward to September 2016, I was able to taste at James Suckling’s first-ever Tuscan “en primeur” barrel tasting where I tasted close to 50 Super Tuscans from 2015. The 2015 Petrolo Galatrona didn’t disappoint. If you’ve never had Galatrona before and aren’t a fan of California styled Merlot, you’ve not experienced a Merlot like this. The nose, while still evolving, was exceptionally complex, layers of earth, spice, leather, and bolder berry flavors but what was most exciting was the floral component: wisps of dried violet and lavender came in at the finish. On the palate the wine was elegant first, so in line, no extra fat: it was sinewy, long, more like a swimmer’s body, supple, long yet you can sense the power and direction. The flavors were still nascent, yet the fruit was preparing to burst forward. The finish was highlighted by elegance, restrained power; I could feel the tension of evolution that was preparing for the next stage of development within this wine. Galatrona has greatness on the horizon, and a long life ahead. Don’t miss out.
",Merlot
"The freshness and integrated acidity of the 2016 vintage keeps this huge wine from being over the top but there is nothing shy about the levels of fruit, extract and alcohol.  This is a hugely rich and heady wine with mouth-filling volumes of buoyant fruit, a lavish texture and intense limestone minerality on the finish.
",Merlot
"Great texture-a must buy for 2016. The merlot shines thru here.
",Merlot
"According to James Suckling, our friend and fellow Bordeaux wine lover, this is a great value--we missed it on the April trip, but we love the 2012 which we carry. Only one negociant has the exclusivity for the USA for marsau and we did not go to that office. I trust james and he says  “This is a rich and dense Marsau and probably the best ever. Full body and a wonderful depth of fruit and chocolate. Love the texture and intensity. Shows sophistication.” 93-94

"Peppery and spicy and not overly extracted.  This is perfectly balanced and lush on the palate.

"Formerly Chateau Tour Musset, acquired by the de Boüard family of Chateau Angelus, and rechristened Clos du Boüard for the inaugural vintage of 2016. The estate consists of 30 hectares of vines in Montagne Saint-Emilion on clay-limestone soils, and lies near the border with Saint-Emilion near the commune of Saint-Christophe-des-Bardes. The 2016 is a blend of 85% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Franc, and 5% Cabernet Sauvignon. Sweet and ripe. Very polished with fine tannins.
",Merlot
"This new venture from the folks at Chateau Angelus would put many Grand Cru Saint-Emilions to shame.  This dark wine is rich and sweet with cocoa, black raspberry and dark cherry fruit and a powerful tannic strike on the finish.  Lots of bang for the buck here.
",Merlot
"The first vintage for Coralie de Bouard and it is a big success. 85%M,10%CF, 5% CS and 100% satisfying on the palate. So sweet and sexy with lovely texture. Perfumy aromas of black cherry-great acidity on the palate. Try this.

"Do not confuse this beauty with the Argentinian Poesia. An April 2017 discovery at Barde Haut. Tons of fruit with some earthy, mineral aromas. Very ripe on the mid palate and soft,lush, lingering finish. Much better than their 2014. Decant one hour and enjoy.
",Merlot
"Here is a fantastic wine that shows the quality, freshness and precision of the vintage.  This big wine is almost black in color with a deep chiseled nose of granite and endless red and black fruit.  The middle is thick, full and completely effortless and fine, integrated tannins sneak in on the finish.  This is a roaring success.
",Merlot
"From a mere 1.2 hectares of vineyards in three small parcels in the very heart of the Pomerol plateau – one near l’Église Clinet, one near La Fleur Petrus, and the third lying midway between Trotanoy and Le Pin. Made entirely of Merlot and aged in 100% new oak barrels. There is incredible intensity here. The wine is deeply colored and wildly aromatic. Very rich in style with ripe, sweet fruit. A bit riper than the vintage on average at 14.7% alcohol but you would never guess. The wine remains very fresh with lively acidity and fine tannins.
",Merlot
"Like the 2015, but maybe a bit more precise and focused. Blackish color, Very aromatic aromas of blackberry and black cherry. So rich yet so balanced.  Only 3000 bottles produced.

"Always made in a “classic” style, the Figeac 2015 shows lots of bright high toned fruits, a focused and lean mouth feel with lots of spicy edges and hints of tobacco and sweet herbs. I would think this wine comes together nicely with some more barrel age. Should prove to be a excellent if not great Figeac!
",Merlot
"Don't be fooled by the price, this is a serious wine that packs a punch.  Fleshy and ripe without bordering on off-dry, this is powerful and rich while maintaining a sense of balance.  Well integrated tannin and acidity provide lift to the generous fruit.  Ripe, juicy blackberry, blueberry and figs, violets, cloves and dried herbs provide the backbone on this incredible offering from Bodegas Volver.  If you like big, bold wines, this should definitely be on your list of wines to try.
",Mourvedre
"This red delivers a whole lot with respect to the under-$20 price point. Organic Monastrell grapes from vines 50-80 years old. Initial notes of sugar plum, red and dark cherries, and strawberry coulis. Hints of herbs and earth as well. On the palate, this wine pleasantly surprised me with a higher acidity than I had expected at first. The fruit quality is ripe, but definitively not overripe nor bordering on off-dry. Flavors of ripe red and dark fruit alike: dark cherry, strawberry, prune, and blackberry compote. Charming black and white pepper, tarragon, and sage notes as well. A touch of vanilla at the end, expected as the wine sees around 14 months in new oak barrels. A well-made, modern style of Monastrell that is sure to please those who are fans of California Cabernet Sauvignon. A great choice as a weekday dinner red to go with various meat dishes
",Mourvedre
"This is a great example of old vine Monastrell (Mourvedre) under $20.  The nose had a lot of  ripe black fruit, strawberry jam, sweet spice and a hint of olive.  The palate delivered a nice amount of dried raspberry and fig, black peppercorn and a hint of thyme.  The complexity of this wine blew me away,  great acidity and a hearty but friendly tannin, with ample fruit.  A great wine to share with friends.  It's no wonder this wine received 92 points from Robert Parker!
",Mourvedre
"While the 2015 vintage of Tarima Hill placed an impressive #17 on this year's Wine Spectator Top 100 list, it is the 2014 that many winemakers and Spanish critics consider the stronger vintage on the Mediterranean influenced, eastern portion of Spain. As usual, this is all old vine Monastrell, which gives fresh, spicy, satisfying, more deeply pitched red fruit flavors and an underlying citrus peel note, with just a smidge of new oak influence which rounds out the texture and contributes a bit of flavor as well. Deceptively complex for a $12.99 wine - and a wine that I am used to being a bit plumper from its earlier vintages - I found myself editing this review a few times as the wine opened up and developed with time. A delicious, super friendly wine for entertaining - at a great price.
",Mourvedre
"What an enchanting rosé of  Mourvedre! The Waterkloof  vineyards are managed with the highest viticultural standards in mind, and this rosé is a direct reflection of that care. The winemaking really begins in the vineyard, as the grapes are harvested at a high acid and low pH, and no sulfur is added. Only the wild yeasts of the vineyard are used in fermentation. Of the palest salmon hue, Mourvedre dazzles in rosé form, with aromas and flavors of delicate raspberry, violet and peony. The wine is aged for eight months on the lees, which lends serious complexity and length to the finish.
",Mourvedre
"This rosé is fresh and light, with beautiful minerality and acidity to complement the succulent fruit. It's wonderful to see a rosé made from an atypical varietal, Mouvèdre, and this South African one delivers with a soft and elegant feel and prominent, but ethereal fruit. It's a wonderful choice now that the weather is warming up and, with its lighter mouthfeel and body, makes a great pairing to a seafood BBQ on the beach.
",Mourvedre
"Had this wine last night with dinner. Perfect summertime BBQ wine! The fruit is ripe and full but not overpowering, the wine has a good middle and long finish. Flavors of red cherries, black berries, smoked meats and sweet oak complete this tasty wine.
",Mourvedre
"This is something that anyone who loves Piemontese wine needs, a charming everyday Nebbiolo. Red fruits with high-toned spice components and subtle herbs.  The nose is very pretty and intriguing.  It is medium- to light-bodied, and the fruit is darker than the nose suggests.  Easy tannins make their presence known but are not intrusive.  Grab some now — unfortunately we didn't get a lot of this.
",Nebbiolo
"This is a supple, lovely, floral and forward Barbaresco from the great 2013 Piemonte vintage. Unlike many of those 2013's, however, this will not set you back $60+ dollars and will not require years of cellaring. The price is right, the wine tastes great now, and any fan of Nebbiolo should absolutely load up!
",Nebbiolo
"Barbaresco for under $20?   Yes, that's correct.  But could it be good?  Yes, it is!  The Bersano ""Mantico"" almost defies credibility by being exactly what it purports to be - a gorgeous and inviting Barbaresco for the most reasonable of prices.  The wine captures the more elegant stylings of Barbaresco with perfumed fruits of Bing cherry and dried strawberry finishing with savory spices, oolong tea and much more supple tannins.   It takes a lot of work and negotiating to get grande marques wines like Brunello, Barolo and Barbaresco down to prices like this, so kudos to buyer, Greg St. Clair for bringing home the prize for what is destined to be one of the best values of the year.
",Nebbiolo
"If you're looking for something fantastic to have with your pasta/risotto tonight or diving into the world of Barbaresco/Barolo, make this your first stop. A great expression of Nebbiolo that gives you an idea of what the region is all about, but in a more ""ready to drink"" style. A touch juicier, but with all of the structure Barbaresco is known for.
",Nebbiolo
"This easy to like super value is a wonderful introduction to the great wines of  the Barbaresco region in Northern Italy.  This is gentle and fruity with rose petal aromas to go with the liberal dusting of dried cherry fruit. Very fine tannins on the elegant finish add precise grip for matching to a wide variety of food.
",Nebbiolo
"This is the deal of the year on honest-to-god Barbaresco, made old school by Bersano since 1907.  Aged in giant Slovenian barrels for a year, then several more in bottle, this has classic Nebbiolo character and power that is actually drinking great now.  Rich cranberry, cherry fruit with the classic mint/amaro herb notes you often get from a great Barbaresco.  It has plush, grippy tannins and the acidity to ensure several years of aging potential.  If you are into the “wine of the kings” you ought to take advantage of this one while it lasts.
",Nebbiolo
"Our best value Barbaresco is back! At $20 this ruby color wine starts with a perfect blend of fresh fruit and earth aromatics while hints of anise intensify the savory aspect of the wine. A bright acidity meets the medium body and medium tannin structure on the palate. A touch of toasted oak spice keep the wine fragrant with coriander and fennel seeds while the dense red fruit keep the mid-palate gently weighted.
",Nebbiolo
"The 2013 Bersano Barbaresco represents outstanding value with the convergence of a great vintage and an exceptional price. This authentic Nebbiolo highlights classic characteristics of earthy red fruits, licorice, dried florals and a hint of leather. It's light on its feet yet has deceptive tannins and acidity that bring it together. It's perfect for meats, cheeses and pasta dishes.
",Nebbiolo
"I love the 2013 Piemontese wines; they are amazing values. The wine’s perfume is pure Nebbiolo: raspberry fruit and dried rose petals with a touch of tobacco and lots of cedar, tar and minerals, displaying outstanding depth and fine overall balance. This wine will drink well now and over the next few years, best with the heartiest meats or stews. Better yet, serve after dinner with some great aged cheeses (Pecorino Romano, Parmigiano-Reggiano or Asiago) and an olive tapenade.
",Nebbiolo
"The nose is full of leather, earth, cedar, cinnamon and hints of red fruit, although this is a subtle wine, more classically Piemontese it isn’t ebullient fruity, it’s subtle, hidden and above all shy. On the palate you see this is Nebbiolo, and old school Nebbiolo at that, gritty, astringent, did I say shy? Yet the wine has a center that shows a bit more weight, it is balanced, has depth but is inherently reticent. Once on the palate this wine begins to expand shows a bit of that earthy, gritty, leathery character comes out with hints of smoke and mushroom. The more time this wine spends in a decanter or a glass it opens exponentially, adding little twists and turns, more grit and then wafts of violet and rose. This isn’t a Gaja Barbaresco at $20 a bottle, it’s a $20 Barbaresco but it has real intrigue and character and for me would be great with a wild mushroom risotto.
",Nebbiolo
"This rosso is made up of 100% Nebbiolo!!! I opened this one on Sunday night and immediately poured it into a decanter and let it open for an hour. There is plenty of fruit, good acidity, soft tannin structure, some minerality, and a lengthy finish. The combination of blue/dark fruit and the black cherry comes from the Nebbiolo, I also find some tar and roses on the lengthy finish. Two Thumbs up !
",Nebbiolo
"Sure-shot for Nebbiolo lovers who want something for ""now."" I am still learning all of the intricacies of Italian wines, but even I could tell this was classic Nebbiolo; the structure is all there with a tiny extra layer of soft fruit that makes this otherwise tannic wine a bit more approachable early. Why spend $70 and wait 8 years when this is good to go now?
",Nebbiolo
"The nose of this Barolo is more fruit than earth, more berries and spice yet it still has hints of leather and smoke. On the palate the richness becomes evident, this wine has a breadth to it, full and fleshy, tannic structure well integrated into the body. The finish is slightly short because this wine’s focus is the mid palate breadth, power, density and loads of flavor.
",Nebbiolo
"Brezza remains among the top tier producers within the Barolo zone and their recent releases are quite impressive. We have a lot of demand for quality, value-priced Nebbiolos and continue to bring them in when we find them. What makes this one unique is not only it's lighter color but also its softer palate and easy drinkability. Some have mentioned it reminds them a bit of a deeper rose with just the right amount of fruit and moderate acidity. It's a perfect intro to Nebbiolo with a lighter touch.
",Nebbiolo
"Chiarlo has remained among the more classic style producers and their 2011 Barolo really showcases Nebbiolo in its purest form. Scents of minerals, red fruits, cedar and florals spring from the glass and it's very expressive and drinkable now as well, thanks to the warmer temperatures in this vintage. Those looking for an excellent, well-priced Barolo that can be opened now or cellared for a few years will love this one.
",Nebbiolo
"The nose on this is classic Cannubi, more sweet elegant aromatics but within a very tight bandwidth, perhaps just slightly darker fruit character than normal. On the palate it is more linear, focused, tightly wound and gradually you feel more leather, earth gradually emerge, the tannins are more evident while in balance. The finish is slightly more forceful as the tannins appear more. In the future the evolution of the mid palate sweetness will soften the tannins; this wine needs a little time.
",Nebbiolo
"The nose immediately lets you know this wine has depth and power; it is a blend of powerful earth and deep, dark fruit. On the palate you sense richness, depth, it’s almost voluptuous and for me a really richly textured wine for a La Morra Barolo. Part if this comes from the use of Roto-Fermenters an incredibly slow machine that turns like a front-loading washer instead of punching down and the results are generally sweeter tannins and deeper colors. The wine is then aged in barrique for 2 years 40% new and 60% used but you really don’t get any toasty vanillin flavors at all but you can feel the torque that it gives the wine.  This Giachini is extravagantly full bodied while being restrained and fresh--yes it can happen at the same time, well balanced and something that if you drank now you’d enjoy. I don’t think this is one to put in the cellar for 40 years but the next 10 or 20 will be fine. Overall a really delicious, well balanced wine that has power but lift and freshness.

"The Ravello is deep red with ruby tones and in the glass you will find, aromas of marzipan, brown spices, dried rose and truffle with brown spices,  and leather. Nicely integrated acidity accentuates the wine's inner-mouth perfume and contributes to an impression of firm structure. Love this Barolo, drink now and over the next few years.
",Nebbiolo
"This Barolo is in a league of it's own. Only six years old, and it's still maintaining it's tannic structure perfectly. Scents of prosciutto and/or salami on the nose, and a deeply complex palette. The Cannubi truly is incredible.
",Nebbiolo
"Although Camerano is the second oldest wine producer within the commune of Barolo, their wines remain relatively unknown outside the zone as they have, until recently, always sold their wines locally. Thankfully a small number of cases make it to the US and we are grateful to offer their latest Barolo ""Cannubi."" Their 2010 is pleasantly aromatic with an array of dark cherries, minerals, licorice and rose petals and full and elegant on the palate with supple berry fruit and fine tannins. This is a first-rate, classic expression of Nebbiolo from one of the most prestigious vineyards within the Barolo communes. While it can be enjoyed today, it will certainly improve in the cellar.
",Nebbiolo
"I love this wine, a classic old school Barolo onion skin coloring around the rim and it looks as if it is already twenty years old!  The nose of this wine is classic, filled with orange peel, leather, rose hips, accented by bits of smoke and truffle. On the palate the wine is full, young and vibrant yet it has a supple fluidity, oh there’s tannin but it’s what you’d expect from classically styled Barolo. The flavors reflect the nose with perhaps a bit more of that orange peel, sotto bosco, leather all subtle and bold in the same moment. The finish is long and very linear; the wine seems to go on and on. Perfect match for braised meats or wild mushroom risotto.
",Nebbiolo
"When last we tasted this, the wine had certainly shut down by comparison to its ""Cannubi"" counterpart giving the impression it's built for the long haul. Brezza's ""Sarmassa"" vines are planted primarily in clay which explains why the wine is often more structured than the Cannubi. Ample and expressive aromas of red fruit, licorice and earth belie a concentrated and complex palate that while closed at present, is sure to emerge with proper cellaring. A first class 2013 Barolo.
",Nebbiolo
"You can tell immediately that this wine is special; the nose is pronounced, complete, and full of tar, spice, truffle and smoke. On the palate this wine has a concentration of flavors but don’t think of it as richer it’s just more comprehensive, layers and layers of effortless fruit, spice along with bits of leather, tar and wild berries. The finish is magnificent, wide, long, bringing back all the nose and fruit, with a bit of jauntiness, just to let you know it is more than just complex fruit.
",Nebbiolo
"If you are looking for ready to drink Barolo- you just found it! The Sarmassa is full of the tar and roses that we love Barolo for, and still has plenty of tannic power and freshness. This will be perfect with rich meaty dishes!
",Nebbiolo
"A charming, brightly fruited Barbaresco, this is a fantastic wine. I wish I could offer more specifics, but ours was a rather raucous tasting group and my notes on this one were not very detailed! I did make a point to describe the fruit as quite pure, suggestive of mixed berries, and I do recall a nearly effortless balance for such a young Barbaresco. Highly recommended.
",Nebbiolo
"Sergio Germano's ""Prapo"" remains one of my favorite Barolos. ""Prapo"" is a vineyard directly below his house in Serralunga and the wine made from this property is always crafted in a traditional way with long masceration on the skins and aging in large oak barrels. His 2012 is fresh and elegant with fragrant aromas of red fruit, licorice, tar and spices while the palate is vibrant with fine chewy tannins and bright acidity. Although 2012 has yielded more elegant Barolos,(and this one is delicious now) don't hesitate to age this one for several years.
",Nebbiolo
"We are just so lucky to have these Rivella wines, the fact that we're able to sell such a stupendous wine at such a reasonable price literally makes me proud to be a part of this organization. The nose explodes from the glass with gorgeous dark red fruits, savory spice, rhubarb jam, figs, and black flinty earth. Juicy and structured, built for at least another 10 years in the cellar, the vibrant nebbiolo fruit is pointed by a wonderful smoky incense quality. A truly world class wine that gets absolutely no attention from the international wine community because WE BUY IT ALL!
",Nebbiolo
"I love the purity, and classic Serralunga flavors in this wine, it has loads of gravelly, cigar ash aromatics with floral hints of roses while darker fruits make the more prominent statement. On the palate the thing that stands out for me is the textural richness, sometimes commune level Barolo can be a bit gritty with un-ripened tannins wine but this wine has richness, sweet tannins and gives one the impression of size. The flavors are darker fruit, as the base component then more spice and leather while finishing up with  layers of  spice,  and bits of leather. An excellent, long finish, no drying tannin just complete flavors that  are superbly balanced, making it a Serralunga Barolo you can drink now!
",Nebbiolo
"Luciano Pira, owner and winemaker at Schiavenza, makes some of the most traditional style Barolos in Serralunga. All of his wines are aged in large Slavonian oak casks and he is always one of the last among his peers to release them. His 2012 is truly a snapshot of the vintage as it's fresh, aromatic and approachable as well. Cherry and plum fruits, earthy minerals and hints of licorice are on display on both nose and palate and the wine remains elegant and lively throughout. This is a truly well made Barolo that can be opened now or appreciated over the next few years if cellared properly.
",Nebbiolo
"The stupendous 2012 Fenocchio is classic Bussia in everyway. The color is a rustic bloody red. A wild nose of dense dark tar, sweet dried roses & herbs, earthy red fruit. Dense but with great structure and length. No stinky new oak, no sweet over ripe fruit. It's a baby and needs sometime, but a fabulous under valued old school Barolo for the long haul.
",Nebbiolo
"Recently I've had a number of customers ask me to select what I consider to be a classic style Barolo that can be opened now or aged for a few years. I immediately pointed to this one. Fenocchio has been making outstanding wines of late and this one is especially noteworthy and worth seeking out. Nebbiolo fans will especially appreciate the classic aromas of deep purple fruit, tar, roses and minerals and a seamless palate with full, ripe tannins. We love this one.
",Nebbiolo
"Black tea on the nose, with lifted fruit and hints of tar and licorice, this Giacomo Fenocchio Barolo is classic and complex, sourced from perhaps the best part of the renowned Bussia vineyard, and treated to extended maceration – nearly 40 days on the skin! The earthy 2012 will benefit dramatically from more time and air but is still drinking beautifully now.

"When you get into the various micro-niches of wine styles and situations, beyond the great twenty dollar bottle of red or the best pairing for a burger, I have to believe there is a such a thing as the perfect inexpensive bottle of Italian red wine to drink both while you’re cooking and while you’re eating a simple pasta on the average weeknight. Not only do I believe that’s a thing, I think it’s a style of wine that must be in pretty high demand given the fact that everyone loves pasta and there’s nothing better than standing there in your kitchen after a long day at work, popping that bottle open, and pouring yourself that first glass while you wait for the water to boil.  There are a number of great inexpensive red wines from all over the world that pair well with pasta, but for me it always feels better to keep things in the family. I like French reds with French bistro food. I like California Zinfandel with my burgers. I like an ice cold bottle of Modelo with my tacos. There's something right about the slightly-tannic, robust, and spiciness of a classic Italian red coupled with the smell of a simmering sauce. The Neprica is from Puglia, the heel in Italy's boot and an expanse of old farmlands that date back centuries. Negroamaro, the principle varietal in the Tomaresca blend, is the region's most important grape, one that adds weight and structure to the wine in this case. The blend is balanced by a healthy dose of Primitivo (think Zinfandel from Italy) and Cabernet Sauvignon that add fruit and additional richness to that tannic frame. At $10 a bottle, this wine covers all the bases for what I'm looking for on a Tuesday night.
",Other Red Wines
"Thrice loved the 2013 vintage of this super-priced, effortlessly enjoyable blend from Tormaresca, and the 2014 is perhaps even a notch above, with more body and structure behind the well of pure fruit and spice. A wonderful wine to open and pair with virtually any Mediterranean or Adriatic-inspired dishes. Drink long and deeply!
",Other Red Wines
"Truly one of my favorite Italian red values! This wine is full-bodied, with ripe but not sweet fruit and excellent structure. It's composed of Primitivo, Negroamaro, and Cabernet--think Super-Tuscan, but with a southern Italian twist! Easy to pair with a variety of foods, and not too high in alcohol, this is a great wine for almost any occasion.
",Other Red Wines
"Neprica has consistently been a go to bargain red for staff and customers alike. The 2014 is no exception. A medium bodied red with lush fruit and bold character is easy, open and inviting; a great wine to drink on its own or great to pair with a flavorful meal. The Negroamaro keeps it rustic, traditional and earthy while the Primitivo (Zinfandel) brings rich, fresh red cherries and ripe berries to the table. A bit of Cabernet Sauvignon brings a touch of structure and lots of acidity. The three blended together create a full fruit, balanced and juicy red to enjoy any day of the week.
",Other Red Wines
"What a great deal on this unconventional combo of varieties. This is a fantastic wine for both food pairing and even drinking on its own. It carries some acid, which will highlight any food its paired with, but not so much it becomes too harsh to cease being a cocktail wine. Great fruit and just a hint of structure, without being overly tannic or tight. More interesting than most wines of this price point, the concentration is ideal here and a top value for an everyday dinner red.

"It is hard to believe that a wine at this price point can carry the quality level it does, but the Antinori family has centuries of experience to back them. This wine is a blend of NE (Negroamaro) PRI (Primitivo) and CA (Cabernet), hence the Neprica name. Negroamaro is Puglia's most important grape and provides the size and frame and structure of the wine, the Primitivo gives it a rich dose of fruit and the Cabernet adds backbone and complexity, all told for the price this wine can't be beat! The 2014 vinatge has a little more freshness than previous vintages, tasty!

"I visited this property a few years ago on a brief but meaningful trip to Corsica.  Petroni's vineyards sit on the hills surrounding Lake Diane, a renowned source for oysters and mussels on the island. While wandering through the vineyards, you can see the Mediterranean sitting to the east just past the lake and when you turn to the west, you see the mountains of Corsica erupting high into the air.  It reminds you what an onerous, inaccessible place this island can be. To their credit, Corsica is famously known as the island often invaded but never conquered.  It is a scene that illustrates the rugged intensity of the people, their wines and the fascinating flavor profiles those wines deliver.  Petroni is a small family estate making their wines at the local cooperative.  This gives it the advantage of access to top flight facilities and some of the best wine consultants on the island. Another advantage - without the added cost of the facility, it keeps the cost more affordable!  Corsica has gained a bit of a reputation for making great wines but the pricing can be as daunting as conquering the island.  The primary grape in the ""Rouge blend"" is the local grape called Niellucciu, thought to be a lost clone of Sangiovese.  The grape offers up the kind of bright acidity, red fruit and savory notes that you usually find in coastal Sangiovese reds.  The rest of the blend is made up of Syrah and Grenache, which amplify the weight and density of the wine while adding layers of roasted black plum, crushed black pepper and Asian spices.  Delicious medium bodied texture with supple tannins and a mild spicy undertone that gives it the lift to make it a great food pairing.  Perfect with the classically grilled meats of the island or hearty fish stews.  This is a wonderfully complex red that reflects the quality and character of the people of the island.
",Other Red Wines
"Th Corsican grape Niellucciu may be a bit of a challenge to wrap your tongue around, but the wines blended from this lusty, robust variety require little effort to enjoy! A distinct, island variant of Sangiovese, plantings in heavily maritime-influenced Corsica are a product of the unique microclimate, mountainous terrain, and abundant sunlight (more than anywhere on the French mainland), ensuring perfectly ripe, beautifully-structured wines with bursting aromas and flavors of purple plums, raspberries, black pepper and a melange of minerals. Succulent and lingering, and at under $13 a great holiday giveaway, but be sure to keep a case for yourself!

"When I tasted this wine I guessed that it cost more than it does. There is a lot going on in this wine for this price. In the nose there are bright dark fruit and pepper aromas. In the mouth this continues with dark fruit flavors and a nice spice note.It is dry and balanced and will go well with food.
",Other Red Wines
"If you've been in the store you've probably heard me waxing poetic about the wines of Corsica. They have a lot of personality, delicious depth, and are very versatile food wines. The new vintage of Petroni is here and it has everything I look for in an easy drinking wine. The nose bursts with dusty red raspberries and violets and on the palate is bright with a hint of spice and white pepper and tannins that gently grip. This has great structure. If you loved the Petroni rose last summer, you'll love the Petroni red this fall .
",Other Red Wines
"Petroni's minerally rosé has always been a summer staple, so I was excited to finally try their take on a red blend. I was not disappointed – the Rouge is a complex, value-driven stunner! Black plum fruit up front, with plenty of lift from the Niellucciu (a clone of Sangiovese), this is earthy through the palate with a peppery kick to the finish. Corsican wine feels like rustic Italian wine made with French sensibilities, and the 2015 demonstrates that beautifully.
",Other Red Wines
"Another lovely little value from the coop in Corsica that's making some of the most affordable and approachable wines in the store. This years Rouge is easily the best we've tasted from them. It does away with the brambly dried fruit of the 2014 and replaces it with a vibrant dark berry, tiny hints of fresh tobacco and evergreen. The palate is medium and wonderfully lifted, with the plummy dark fruit taking over from the subtle earthy herbal quality on the nose. Super juicy length and clean. A total joy to drink and priced to move.

"One of the biggest sensations to hit Bordeaux over the last decade has been the dry white movement, the lettered expressions from Yquem and Guiraud that have the weight and richness of a classic Sauternes, but without all the sugar. I've always felt that the Prisoner succeeded in providing Port customers with a similar red wine option. Everyone loves Port, but they don't always want that much alcohol and sugar in their table wine. The Prisoner has always been the happy medium for lovers of big, decadent wines. The 2016 has so much juicy red cherry fruit, bolstered by dessert notes like mocha and oak, but it comes with more approachable levels of alcohol and sweetness. It's everything it's always been: smooth, silky, and bursting with decadence. Back for another run with a new vintage.

"The amazing Tannat-derived wines of Madiran could almost be thought of as ‘medicine’, as they contain the highest levels of cardiovascular-enhancing anthocyanins—think resveratrol— of any wines. Take heart, as they also possess the added appeal of being absolutely delicious. Peyros is an aromatic, deeply-structured wine, replete with flavors of black plums, cocoa powder, spices and fresh roasted coffee, with plenty of stony minerality to boot. Being primarily Tannat, tannins are still present, but with a few years behind it, this wine is crushed velvet on the finish. Uncork and enjoy with a soulful, wintry beef stew!
",Other Red Wines
"I am falling in love with the wines of Madiran.  There has been so much forward progression in the making and styling of these wines, it is hard to keep up.  I'm not the only one either.  Fans of fuller bodied reds from Bordeaux, Cahors and even California are finding a lot to like here.  We have had tremendous success with a few noteworthy producers but for cost to quality, no one beats Peyros.  Densely packed, velvety structrue, deep dark fruit and tons of graphite minerality are just a few of my notes when tasting the old vine Peyros.  The small percentage of Cabernet Franc adds a little polish but the wine never loses its focus on its Tannat roots.  This is bold and savory wine that is at its most harmonious with lush charcuterie, grilled sausages and of course, my favorite winter treat - Cassoulet!
",Other Red Wines
"A blend of 80% Tannat and 20% Cab Franc, the Peyros is one of the most interesting under French reds we have right now. I find touches of charcoal and black fruit on the nose with just a hint of leather. On the palate there is an incredibly pure fruit expression--you could draw similarities to Bordeaux or Chinon, but it has a thing all its own going on. With really mighty tannins, it is highly structured. This is pretty good right now, great, in fact, for the price. But you could just as easily sit on this and watch it evolve into something really special.

"Ouch! The vineyards of Peyros are built upon gravelly soils covered with large stones deposited by glaciers during the last Ice Age, which created a surfeit of sore feet for any herd of woolly mammoths that galumphed upon them. Hm, might explain their extinction....but  the mammoth loss is your gain, as these scattershot stones also retain heat that gracefully ripens the grapes on these old vines, leading to wines of impeccable power, warmth and depth.  High-toned aromatic black fruits lift from the glass, revealing a lush viscosity with notes of dark cherry, black plum, pepper, menthol and smoke on the rich, velvety palate, finishing long and lovely. A veritable ""mam-mouthful"" of wine!

"Distinctive herbal nose, reminiscent of caraway seeds, with inky cassis and deep plum fruit, solid minerality through the palate, and smokiness on the finish, Château Peyros ""Vieilles Vignes"" is made from old vines and it shows in the glass – the 2012 is intense! Textured and viscous but not as aggressively tannic as Madiran can be, the Tannat here is tempered with just enough woodsy Cab Franc for balance and drinkability. A powerful, quality wine at an incredible price.

"Madiran is a tricky wine sometimes.  Often, in their youth, they are more wines of texture and richness than aromatic expression.  The Peyros VV has all of that full bodied meatiness, velvety tannins and black currant density but it also has subtlety.  Give this an hour in the decanter and you will be rewarded with all the savory pencil lead and graphite minerality which matches the cassis flavors.  Also unlocked are the light floral tones of violet and camphor along with a smoky meaty quality.  Ideal for winter braises such as short ribs and lamb stew but even better with a big plate of charcuterie, cheeses and pâtés.  Throw a couple in the cellar as well and you will be well rewarded down the road.

"The 2016 vintage is incredible in Tuscany and I have tasted some wines in the Barrel that are extraordinary, this is one of the first releases and you’re going to love it! The O’lilo is a blend of 25% Merlot, 25% Syrah, 25% Cabernet and 25% Sangiovese made just outside of the town of Cortona. Syrah in Italy? Yes and Cortona is ground zero for Syrah, it adds a bit of mid palate meat to your classic Super Tuscan blend with Sangiovese and Cabernet. The wine has excellent aromatics displaying the fruits of a spectacular growing season. Once you put the wine in your mouth you experience the supple richness where ripe black fruit melds into the bits of earth and spice. Outstanding wine for the price!

"The 2013 vintage in Washington was one of the warmest in the past decade with favorable temperature conditions extending into fall. The accelerated ripening that occurred in the warmer than average summer was offset by cooler temperatures and light rains in September. Both helped result in stellar fruit characters and flavors. Composition in this red blend was 59% Merlot, 36% Syrah, 4% Viognier, and 1% Cabernet Franc. On the nose, layered aromas of sugar plum, blackberry, and raspberry. Tertiary aromas of cedar and fruitcake follow. On the palate, flavors of rich black cherry and pluots, with notes of vanillas and baking spices following. A fantastic red blend for under $15!

"Chateau Bouscasse is a master of Madiran. Yes, this is a big, full-bodied wine, but at the same time it is elegant and seamless, with perfect integration of the Tannat, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Cabernet Franc that make up the blend. While the wine is certainly structured, the tannin are sweet and ripe, not austere or abrasive. The fruit is a saturated, intense blackberry fruit that is quite clean and polished. Overall a beautiful wine, and very well made.

"Alain Brumont is making some amazing moves in Madiran, enough to earn him acclaim as a star winemaker, and this sophisticated red proves why. The nose is aromatic – perfumed yet just herbal enough to keep things interesting – with hints of licorice and a surprisingly silky mouthfeel for Tannat.  The 2012 Château Bouscassé is more elegant than previous powerful vintages: textured and layered but not as intensely tannic as Madiran can be. In fact, this feels more velvety and open, with generous fruit and just enough satisfying structure through the finish to age well. A killer value, here just in time to pair beautifully with rich holiday meals.
",Other Red Wines
"This is great Madiran starting with the fact that the winemaker holds the vintage for a few years before release (this 2012 is the latest) to make sure it has reached its optimal drinking window. As for this style in particular, it is gorgeously approachable while being very true to style: Tannat is the driving force here, staining the glass with its purple depth and satisfying the taste buds with each sip of its structured style. Stock up for the Holidays!
",Other Red Wines
"An absolute stunner of a wine that reveals an incredibly concentrated, dark-fruited character with a polished tannic structure. Plum preserves, blackberries and bitter chocolate notes jump out of the glass along with more refined touches of allspice and vanilla. The tannins on this wine are so dialed-in for a wine at this price--you can see exactly where this wine is going with a little age. After I tasted the wine, I went back a few hours later, and the tannins had softened considerably. This is a inky, concentrated wine that shows impressive winemaking skill, and showcases the regional character of Madiran.
",Other Red Wines
"Proprietor Alain Brumont has truly revolutionized the region of Madiran so much for the better.  Madiran, a region best known for producing wines with jaw-breaking tannic structure, Brumont has perfected the accessibility of the Tannat grape through his strict selection of fruit and winemaking practices.  His Chateau Bouscasse property is his original property and it shows all the classic nature of the region with its flavors of melted licorice, menthol, black currants, roasted plums and cocoa husks.  It also captures the essential velvety structure of the wines which usually requires years of bottle age to obtain.  An amazing follow-up to the past vintages we have carried, the 2012, much like a teenager, is still a little brooding in its youth.  Unlike said teenager, the underlying richness and fruit unfold given a little time and air.  The palate unfolds with ripe aromatics and the velvety tannins one associates with Tannat and Brumont's particular winemaking style.   For certain, you could cellar this for a decade but as we approach the cooler seasons, this would make quite the foil for decadently rich braises and stews.

"I first tried this grape varietal with the 2008 vintage, when I met Mario Andrion (Oenologist) and I soon planed a trip to visit the winery in May of 2010 (www.castellodiverduno.it) they have a great hotel ! Pelaverga has a DOC, in the region of Piedmont in Italy. The small zone has a vineyard area of only eight hectares, and includes the commune of Verduno, from which the name is taken, as well as parts of the communes of La Morra and Roddi d´Alba in the province of Cuneo.

We're certainly paying greater attention to this one after just re-tasting it. The winery manages to offer some of the best from the zone and we're especially taken with this one.

"Umbria, Italy’s only land-locked region, has always played second fiddle to Tuscany. The countryside is very similar but because it’s less crowded with tourists one might even say it’s better. For years the region’s most famous wine was Orvieto, a white blend sometimes made half-sweet that was present across America during the 1960s to mid 1990s. It was about that time when America made the great switch. On November 17th 1991, Morley Safer on 60 Minutes told Americans about the French Paradox: The French, drinking more red wine and eating more fat, still had lower rates of heart disease. Before that we used to sell two bottles of white wine for every one bottle of red. We now sell three to four bottles of red for every bottle of white. Needless to say the sales of Orvieto have decreased dramatically, and Umbria was left looking for a red wine to export. Umbria had never really been known for their red wines, but in the mid 1980s, Sagrantino di Montefalco, a wine traditionally made sweet, had been revised into a dry red. Alvaro Palini, trained as a fashion designer, revolutionized the production of Sagrantino at the Adanti winery. A tremendous amount of the credit should also go to the Arnaldo Caprai Winery. They brought the idea to America in a big way. Most Sagrantino is massively tannic—one needs a good dentist to drink it regularly. Terre de Trinci winery, which made this wine, started in 1992, the year Sagrantino gained DOCG status. I find their Sagrantino more supple, milder and unforced. It still shows the classic structure but it is much better balanced than most. Enjoy it with a grilled T-bone or a cheese-laced lasagna.

"Red fruits really dominate this wine, making it a super fun, approachable red blend that's just rockin' for Summer and rolling into Fall. Juicy bright fruit and a medium weighted palate are showcased and the flavors are really expressive and punchy. This is certainly an easy-drinking, but not over-simplified, wine which would be as fun to drink with food as it is on its own.  I will definitely be happy to drink this one any night of the week.

"This is a stellar blend of Carmenere, Carignan and Pais.  The Maule Valley is the largest and one of the oldest growing regions in Chile.  The valley offers many different soil types and micro climates, which leads to beautiful aromatics and complexity.  The nose opens up into ripe raspberries, crushed black pepper, fresh roasted coffee beans, rich coaco and sun kissed wild flowers.  It has nice acidity,  balanced tannins, lush fruit and exotic spices on the palate.

"Canto sur translates roughly as ""Southern Song,"" and is both an ode to the more southerly Maule Valley as well as the grapes which have made it their home. A blend of Carignane, Pais (Mission) and Carmenere, I cannot think of a red blend that is more proudly Chilean than this! Fortunately these also happen to be highly compatible grapes for blending, which you can immediately tell from this charming and authentic wine. The nose offers something brightly fruited, with some slightly savory and scruffy wild herbs as well , and the palate shows everything I love about these grapes, particularly the juicy and mouthwatering Carignane fruit and the tense, focused, slightly tannic Pais. Any wine as delicious, honest, and expressive as this for under $12 is a big win!

"It's awesome to see a wine from Waiheke Island stateside, especially at this price as they are often much higher, simply due to the cost of getting them over here. This is a smooth, soft, deep-fruited red blend that would pair greatly with a steak dinner. I love that it has some soft tannin and juicy acidity to give it structure and brightness, but overall it's silky and perfect for different kinds of red lovers.

"There is something truly intriguing about Madiran.  The powerful structure of the wines is not for the faint of heart.  The weight and richness often lead you down a path that at times feels dark and foreboding.  But isn't that what builds intrigue?  Vigneron Alain Brumont always takes us on a journey with his wines making some of the most successful wines from the region.  Originally having no interest in winemaking, Brumont inherited his first vineyard, Chateau Bouscasse, from his father.  Alain educated himself in all things Madiran and became one of its biggest advocates in the market illuminating the qualities of the wines and producing most of them in an approachable style.  The ""Argile Rouge"" is special because it is a single parcel planted on red clay, a soil type very rare in the region.  This soil creates what they refer to as the ""gentle Madiran.""  That is the case here as the ""Argile Rouge"" has the polished tannins and supple mouthfeel of a much more aged wine.  Sultry notes of smoked alder, graphite minerality, sweet currants and roasted plums lead to a smooth and balanced wine that should charm those that are already fans of the region as well as making many new fans for its polished richness.  Like many Madiran, this has the potential for a little bottle aging, but being a 2009 the wine is showing so much of its beautiful potential now.

"For those of you who love bold, full-bodied, dark-fruited wines at a great price point, this is one not to miss! This Madiran from a stellar vintage is perfectly aged, with soft, black plum fruit, well-integrated tannin, and lovely savory, earthy notes on the finish. Madiran may have a reputation for being aggressive and overly tannic, but here is a perfect example of why that stereotype is outmoded. Here is a lovely, silky, smooth and perfectly developed bottle whose tannin is quite well placed, and merely adds to the overall power of the wine.

"I have always had a soft spot for Madiran , and the 2009 Bouscasse absolutely reaffirms it for me. This dense, rich wine with its dark color, delivers generous aromatics of cassis, cigar box, along with a very attractive floral note, and crushed stones. It does have an elegant woodsy/ oak note as well. It is a very balanced wine, that will age beautifully for many years. Indeed this is a great opportunity to put some Madiran away, because it is almost impossible to find aged Madiran this side of the Atlantic.

"I was really taken by the nose of this wine, it has a wild, windswept Mediterranean brush scent to it, with leather and earth but it has its own uniqueness. Perricone is one of Italy’s hundreds of indigenous grape varieties and the breadth of them all sometimes makes it difficult to handle. When I first tasted this wine I was stunned, the mouthfeel, density and balance where exceptional, these vineyards are at 1500’ so retain more freshness and balance. The wine reminded me a bit of Syrah’s structure and weight but the flavors are all Perricone, spice, sandalwood, rosemary, fresh leather and a bit of minerality. A powerful wine this would go best with leg of lamb.

"Porta del Vento is located at 2,000 feet above Palermo near Camporeale. Here the hillsides are steep and subjected to high winds, extreme temperature shifts and difficult terrain. Owner and winemaker Marco Sferlazzo farms biodynamically and is one of the few to work with the rare red varietal known as Perricone. His is one of the finest made and boasts complex aromas of plum, blue fruits, violets, herbs and minerals. Additionally it's structured yet balanced with a medium-bodied palate of dried blue fruits, fine tannins, juicy acidity and low alcohol as well. This is a rare wine that Italophiles will especially enjoy.

"I think Cerasuolo di Vittoria is one of Sicily’s most refreshing wines, don’t get the idea it’s simple or light it’s just the blend of Nero d’Avola to give it some body and mid palate sweetness is the perfect foil for Frappato that adds lift, freshness and a vibrant cherry core. The nose is heavenly, wafting aromas of wild cherry and plum fills your nose and when the wine hits your palate you get a sense of weight and richness, not heavy because the Frappato’s acidity lifts it in the end. A perfect accompaniment for pasta or chicken.

"Musella’s wines have an elegance, a supple grace to them and don’t carry that “heavy” connotation that most would tag on Amarone—but to really understand Amarone you must understand Valpolicella first! I really like folks to work their way up the chain to understand the base flavors that make Amarone, and if you start with the 2014 Musella Valpolicella Superiore you’ll see why these are the grapes for Amarone. But if you venture just a little deeper to the 2013 Musella Valpolicella Ripasso Superiore you’ll hit the OMG moment. This is a stunning wine, with layers of spice, complexity and then a richly textured body…wow.

"Once again, another winner from Domaine Baud. Definitely give this bottle a little room to breath--when it starts to open up, it gets more and more enjoyable. The 30% Pinot Noir I believe also helps let this Trousseau-heavy blend come alive.

"This Trousseau blend  embodies the distinct earthiness the wines in this region can exude. This wine is aromatic, like walking through a forest, with aromas of crunchy berries, pine and fallen leaves. With one sip you can taste cherry, clove, cured meats and graphite while enjoying bright acidity, a medium body and soft tannins. Pair this unique red with roasted duck or game bird.

"Another great wine to throw into the mix of my ever growing list for light, well balanced red wines. This blend of Trousseau and Pinot Noir is earthy and mineral driven as is to be expected from a Jura. However, the Pinot blended into it gives it a little more blue fruit and adds a layer of complexity to this wine that completely works. The acid stays focused driving the wine forward and it finishes with a hint of dusty structure. Super tasty and fun for those looking at other options in light bodied red wines.

"A deeply fruity and powerful red blend, yet nuanced and complex. Aromas of cherries, blueberries, and blackberries. Fruit quality is slightly jammy, but overall mostly ripe in expression.  Bouquet of vanilla, espresso, and mocha. Soft tannins accented by a noted elevated acidity on the finish. A tinge of dried herbs, most noted being thyme and marjoram. Overall, this robust wine appeals to those who are fans of red blends like The Prisoner. Great option for summer barbeques; also fun pairing with olive tapenade

"The Bootleg Napa Valley Red Wine blend is luscious and full, brimming with jammy blueberry, strawberry, cassis and plum. subtle floral aromatics of violet waft over the fruit, and dusty spice aromas of star anise, cinnamon and white and black pepper round out the finish. Merlot from Napa's famous Stagecoach vineyard is a major component in the blend, which adds a deliciously supple and velvety tannin, and provides depth and structure.

"The first time I tasted the 2013 Bootleg Red I was taken back numerous years to the first time I tasted Prisoner. They reminded me so much of each other it was a bit surprising. There was the same intensity, the same largesse, the same power to the wines that I was really taken aback. Then my brain started doing the “math” and I realized just what a killer wine the Bootleg Red was. I mean Prisoner is almost $50 now, which is difficult for most people to spend on a regular basis, and this incredibly similar wine is $32.99, much more affordable for the masses. So if you like big, brooding, oaky and darkly fruited red blends this new kid on the block is something you surely will want to chase down.

"Translated into English, “Guado al Tasso” means “Badger Ford”—sounds like an Australian winery! Perhaps it would have been better to just leave it mysterious. Anyway, the “Ford” is located in Bolgheri (pronounced BOWL-ga-ree), a Tuscan coastal village that has become famous as the home of renowned wineries such as Sassicaia and Ornellaia. The Guado al Tasso estate, run by Piero Antinori, has been in his mother’s family for centuries and was once more than 10,000 acres. Today it is 2500 acres that spread from the seashore up into the hills. Piero’s mother’s sister married Mario Incisa della Rocchetta; the couple received the Sassicaia estate as part of the dowry. In classic Italian fashion, the Guado al Tasso estate is not just wine. Wheat, barley and oats are planted, along with olive groves and forest where they raise free-range pigs. Bolgheri was known for rosé wines until the 1970s, when Sassicaia became world famous as part of the Super Tuscan phenomenon. Guado al Tasso first produced wines of the 1990 vintage and soon became one of the big names in the region. As if the Antinori name wasn’t big enough there already, Piero’s brother Lodovico started Ornellaia, and his cousin is over at Sassicaia. In 1994 the area was given its own DOC based on Bordeaux varietals, in an effort to standardize the concept of Super Tuscan. The 2014 Guado al Tasso Il Bruciato is a blend of 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 15% Syrah. To increase the fruit aromatics, part of the Merlot and Syrah is fermented separately at lower page 6 D’Amico winery has a dramatic setting near the town of Orvieto. In the cellar at Guado al Tasso, you can’t miss the Antinori name. page 7 temperatures. The wine doesn’t have the sweetness that I find in California wines. With this vintage there is more earth and leather. Try this wine with a Tuscan T-Bone and live like an Italian.

"The nose of this wine is full of earth, dried rose petals, and ash with hints of plum and leather. On the palate this wine seems more related to Nebbiolo than to anything else, it has the classic tannic structure not harsh but a little gritty.

While the others have generally displayed darker fruit, earthy aromas and rustic tannins the Arcuri is more akin to a lighter Nebbiolo.

"I tasted this wine as a favor for a salesman friend but I had little hope that I would like this wine. Syrah and Nero d’Avola as a blend just didn’t seem to work in my mind, yet this wine is super and when you factor in the price it is almost unbelievable. The nose is Nero d’Avola, that gentle, plum sweetness you’d expect but not an over-ripe version just clean, and faceted aromatics. On the palate you can feel the presence of the Syrah; it adds structure, mid palate density and a layer of sophistication, while the Nero d’Avola’s fruit keeps it from being heavy. The finish is balanced, fresh, with good body that shows you weight without being heavy, the perfect wine for your Tuesday Lasagna.

"I know that we sing the praises of the folks at Banshee often, but there is a reason for it. They are making some of the best, affordable wines on the Domestic market today. One of the sneakiest of those releases is their yearly Rose release which seems to sell out faster and faster every year. This year may be their best ever rose as they went away from the 100% Pinot Noir rose model to add more dimension and complexity by adding Syrah, Grenache and Barbera to the mix. These varietals have all shown up in a big way but counterintuitively making a much more refined and delicate rose. Think Rainier cherry, white sage, soft minerality and rose hips all draped over a core of firm raspberry fruit. I loved this, the staff loved this and I think you’ll love it too.

"Normally, I pretty much just drink Rose from Provence and Sancerre. I love the acidity and brightness there. However, Banshee has produced a GREAT, and affordable dry Rose for 2016.

"Big, loamy and full of massive and bursting flavors, this wine is packed to the brim with aromas of India ink, pastilles, blackberry candy and a slight bloody character. Entering juicy and broad, the name Eruption is a bit literal—this impresses with black cherry, anisette, wild berry preserves and has quite a bit of umami savor. Ramey’s touch on the finish shows with a classical dryness and spice rather than what so many wines of this ilk do, which is pack in the sugar.

"Fredi Torres was a DJ before hearing the siren call of the Priorat. Now he is one of the people often recognized as breathing new life into this famed, resurgent Catalan wine region. This bottling is as delicious an introduction to Priorat as I have tasted in quite some time. Savory thyme and Mediterranean scents lead to a palate full of dark fruits, sauvage, meaty qualities, and a persistent minerality which leaves a wonderfully fresh impression on the mid palate through to the finish. This reminds me of what I first loved about Chateaunneuf du Pape when I first tasted those wines. Pair with braised lamb or short ribs for a real treat, and toast to the future of  Priorat!

His NeroSanlore is one of several old vines single vineyard wines he produces and is considered the most elegant of them.

"If you’re tired of simplistic Nero d’Avola and you’re willing to give Nero d’Avola one more chance this is your wine.

This is one of the most Southerly points in Europe, it is actually south of the city of Tunis in Africa and this is the place for this grape. The nose is full of wild plum touched with a salty brine, it’s heady, thick like humid air. On the palate the wine shows a full, richly textured body while still demonstrating a facile, lively presence.

"Paolo Panerai is a man who knows what he wants. One of Chianti Classico’s best known producers, he has been making wine at his estate, Castellare di Castellina, for more than 25 years. His wines have always been known for their elegance and purity, and for being exceptionally well balanced and long-lived. Paolo is not a man who rests on his laurels. He purchased a winery in the Maremma, along the Tuscan coast, called Rocca di Frassinello. It too is lauded for its wine quality and has received many high scores from famed wine reviewers. Paolo is not a man wanting for a challenge either, so, looking to make wines entirely different from those of his other two Tuscan properties, he purchased Feudi del Pisciotto. Feudi del Pisciotto is an estate in Sicily, just a little north of Vittoria on Sicily’s south coast but closer to the eastern side of the island. Not too far from the estate is a town called Avola, just above Siracusa on the eastern coast. This is where the grape called Nero d’Avola, the black from Avola, comes from. What English speakers call a red grape, Italians call a black grape. In the mid-1990s there was an explosion of Nero d’Avola, coming from newly planted vineyards. It was Italy’s answer to the easy drinkability and fresh fruitiness of California’s Pinot Noir. Unfortunately this included lots of very low-priced wine from very young vines and a whole lot of “winemaking,” and predictably the craze faded rapidly. That’s not to say Nero d’Avola isn’t a superb grape; it just wasn’t being grown properly and it was being forced to be something it wasn’t. Paolo Panerai had an idea about how to let this grape express itself and do it at a price point that wouldn’t be super low end but wouldn’t break the bank either. The wines at Feudi del Pisciotto offer the aromatics I look for in Nero d’Avola. They reflect the abundance of Sicilian sun, a kiss of salt from the nearby sea and a soft and inviting richness.

"While you will not likely hear anyone extolling the virtues of the challenging, atypically cool 2013 Douro vintage, personally I love it. A few of my favorite wines from this year show fine aromatics, with more delicate floral notes, and a fresh, well delineated compliment of flavors perked up by slightly higher acidity and nicely toned by a combination of lower alcohol, more subtle fruit and firm grape tannins. Quinta do Popa made a wonderful Douro blend this year, focusing as usual on their Touriga Franca, a grape whose aromatics and freshness stand in contrast to the more common leading actor, Touriga Nacional (no doubt a fine talent but perhaps prone to overdoing it from time to time).  30% Tinta Roriz and some other varieties round things out for this blend.  The wine is both red and dark fruited, mineral, tautly structured, and perfect for whatever you may decide to throw on the grill.

"When a wine gets 95 points and a massive applause from Mr. Robert Parker himself, there's generally not much need to say anything more, but for the sake of context I'll add in a few more notes here. I was shocked by the restraint of this wine, which sounds ridiculous when talking about a massive 15+% CA red wine. The palate was fleshy, textural, brimming with black fruit, and full of concentration, but it was never too sweet, too oaky, or too much for me to handle. The blend was aged for 14 months in both French and American oak barrels, but only 30% of them were new and that's important because the fruit is what's on full display here, not the wood. For those who like big California flavor without sickeningly saturated or extracted profiles, this is great find. It's a more serious wine than something like Orin Swift's Prisoner and it's definitely going to make quite a few friends with its huge press and reasonable mid-range price.

Floral and fresh berry flavors, along with just the right amount of tannic backbone, combine to create one delicious, balanced red Douro wine. It's more about balance and drinkability then brawn and extraction, which is right on trend in this beautiful Portuguese wine growing region.

"My new favorite rosé has arrived, just in time for the tail end of the season! This is the classic style of Rioja ""clarete,"" which is to say a delicious blend of Garnacha and Viura, macerated together briefly and fermented dry, dry, dry. Flavors of tangy red berries, ripe citrus and peach skins carry an electric acidity, though texturally speaking this wine has plenty of weight to allow for a wide variety of food pairings. From Ossau-Iraty cheese to grilled salmon, or oven roasted chicken thighs with preserved lemons, tomatoes and olives, this wine is ready for whatever you throw its way. A wonderful old school expression of Riojano rosé, produced by one of the region's leading talents in Honorio Rubio.

"This is a good port to serve with a non-chocolate dessert course. The bombastically nutty and spicy profile complements your dessert course beautifully, when a more delicate style of Tawny would get crushed. Try it with creme brulee or pumpkin pie! An open bottle in the fridge will change very slowly, so pour it when called for... it will last for weeks or even months.

"German born Dominik Huber did not to my knowledge grow up in a winemaking family, though he did grow to develop a love of good food, cooking and fine wine, and decided to venture into wine production in the beautifully rustic Priorat region of southern Catalonia accompanied by his then business partner, South African savant Eben Sadie. Having learned over the years how to spot a great vineyard, and more recently, how to harness the fruit to retain all of the Mediterranean character with maximzied mineral expression and freshness through thoughtful winemaking, Dominik now is right up there amongst the top few projects in Priorat. His Torroja ""villages"" bottling, from the very good 2014 vintage, took a bit of bottle age to open up over the past year or so, but is now showing fantastically, with beautiful dark berries and red fruited aromas, as well as floral qualities on the nose. Juicy and spicy, ripe yet wonderfully fresh, I truly believe that this is Priorat as it should be. Drink it up.

"The ""Torroja"" bottling is considered the flagship wine, sourced from a couple ofvineyard sites in the village of Torroja. Made from 50% Garnacha and 50% Cariñena, the wine is whole-cluster pressed, and fermented in concreteand large format, neutral oak. The resultant wine is well-structured, with clean black currant and plum on the palate, highlighted by a savory mushroom note.

"This is fantastic, young port, a true representative of both the house style at Taylor as well as the special vineyard site that is the Quinta de Vargellas. This is a vineyard in the rugged, eastern Douro Superior, where incredibly hot days are tempered by cooler nights than in the rest of the /Douro, resulting in wines of great fragrance, freshness and intensity. While Vargellas definitely marks the finest of Taylor's wines in broad based declared vintages (most recently 2011), it is in the very fine, non declared years such as 2015 where you have something truly special in a single quinta Port bottling. Deeply vinous and floral on the nose, the palate of freshly plucked wild blackberries and schist/granite minerality, with a markedly less sweet impression than many other houses, is what makes this wine special. If you feel like you need to wait too long on your 2011's (or even your 2007's or '94 for that matter), then enjoy these now for their lovely fragrance and sheer power, or stash away for another decade for something really special to emerge.

"Classic Taylor's structure. Pure blackberry fruit; so beautiful on the palate. Wave-after-wave of fruit with fabulous complexity and harmony of fruit and tannins. Lots of berry fruit along with subtle spice notes and grippy tannins give this wine excellent length and body. A very impressive Quinta.

"A single-vineyard Port is an elegant way to finish any meal, and since this particular wine has already been aged 10 years in barrel, it is ready to go. One needn't worry about if suffering from oxidation either, after 10 years of slow exposure in oak, a few months re-corked in your cellar or liquor cabinet will not hurt it. This has more vintage-like power and full black fruit than your average 10 year tawny, and goes very well with cobblers and pies as well as the more traditional match with cheese.

"For the fans of Nouveau who want a Domestic option, this offering from Cruse Wine Co. certainly has the complexity you won’t get with most. Aromas of dried strawberries and plum intermingle with black pepper, hay, and Dr. Pepper. Strawberries again, with banana and pomegranate. Dried herbs on the finish along with a note reminiscent of a Saison or Farmhouse ale. Serve slightly chilled

"I am loving the 2011 vintage LBV bottlings. While perhaps this is a bit controversial, I happen to believe that the overall quality of a vintage absolutely has a strong impact on the quality of a producer's LBV, and here is yet another example that proves the point. Sweet aromas of dark fruit, licorice and cracked black pepper lead to a quite vinous and structured style port, with classic violet inner mouth aromas emerging as well. While it could certainly be a great dessert on its own, this would be terrific with a flourless chocolate cake.

"A lot of famous wines from famous vintages let me down. This 1963 Taylor is not one of them. This spectacularly aromatic, effortless port brightened up a Thursday here at K&L with its vinous perfection. The only thing that I can imagine improving this wine would be a little time to settle, and a wheel of stilton.

"Calabria is positioned at the toe of the Italian Peninsula boot. A short ferry ride across the straits of Messina takes you to Calabria’s more famous neighbor, Sicily. Calabria is almost a land that time forgot. Its dramatic, rugged coastline and interior mountains make it difficult for mass industry or agriculture to take hold. A bit more than a century ago, Calabrians made up a large portion of the immigrants passing through Ellis Island on their way to new lives in America. Calabria still suffers from isolation compared to other Italian regions, but it is blessed with extraordinary beauty, striking vistas and a passionate populace. It was 50 years ago that Consolato Malaspina, passionate about the land and its fruits, decided to make wine. Consolato is still making the wine and has passed on his love of the land to his family, including his four daughters, Domenica, Caterina, Irene and Patrizia. The grapes for this wine come from vineyards at the farthest point south in Calabria, right on the coast and at almost 2300 feet above the sea. This unique and dramatic position offers the Malaspina family a very special climate zone in which to grow their vines. They are able to harvest in mid-October and the result is a better balanced wine. This month’s wine, the 2012 Malaspina Il Palizzi Calabria IGT, is a blend of two indigenous grapes. It is 50% Calabrese Nero and 50% Nocera. The wine is fermented in stainless steel and then aged in French Allier Barriques. I feel this wine reflects the character of their neighboring Sicilian wines from Etna and the Faro DOC, with a little bit of tannic grip and a very complex aromatic nose. Like most Italian wines this wine is made for food. The Malaspinas suggest pasta with a pork ragu sauce, or roasted leg of lamb, or sausage. Let yourself be creative and dive in!

"Wow! This is one of the most interesting, complex wines that I have had in a number of weeks. It has an intense nose of black licorice, red fruits and baked brown sugar. On the palate, a totally different game with tart chalkiness and tannin. An absolute delight that is affordable, as well!

"Mission, or Pais, is a little of a head scratcher for me, especially if you read the back label. This is a wine that plays with expectations; it smells like a Pinot but with the power of a Cab. Aromatically it is delicate red berries macerated with a moderate amount of spices; on the palate are big, solid and polished tannins.  What isn’t confusing is how good this wine is.
",Other Red Wines
"This is a great expression of the Mission or Pais grape! Perhaps one of the more difficult varietals to make well, this grape has a large presence in Chile, and in its best form can be both a powerful and intriguing wine. This bottle shows smoky, meaty aromas, with bright boysenberry fruit. On the palate, the wine is medium bodied, with exuberant young berry fruit, fine-boned tannin, and bright, tangy acidity. Overall a fresher, lighter style of Pais, but with the dark-fruited smokey intensity that marks this varietal's unique expression.

"I continue to be really pleasantly surprised by the rosés coming out of Corsica. I never would have thought that Niellucciu, the native red grape of Corsica, to be an ideal candidate for rosé. But it works so well. The Santamaria rosé has that effortless, refreshing weight and texture. The acid here is bright and energetic, with light fruit notes of strawberry and cherry. Corsican rosé continues to really impress me, and for anyone who loves rosé from Provence, I highly recommend you check these out.

"Bonny Doon has always always chosen the not so obvious, off the beaten path varietals for their wines, but when they finally got around to putting this tiny little grape called Cabernet Sauvignon in their wines, they decided to treat it in the old-school Bordeaux style of a ""Claret"" by creating a light and fruity, easy to drink red blend that was once all the rage in England during the 18th century. And that is precisely what this wine embodies; a fun, juicy, quasi bistro-style blend that is sure to surprise those discerning palates while simultaneously capturing the delight of those not so pompous. This is a true crowd pleaser that will win over every audience with its spicy red fruit and silky yet lifted texture!

"I won't lie -- before my first sip of this wine I expected what I call a ""Flapjack Friday"" wine.  You know the kind -- rich, extracted and thick enough to pour over your breakfast hotcakes. Well, I stand corrected. You should buy this excellent value because it is bright, cheery yet still packed with flavor and is much easier on the palate (and pocketbook) than you're expecting for a value priced California red blend. Nice red fruit, balancing acid and the best part of all -- a low 13.2% ABV.
",Other Red Wines
"I love big, rich wines. Even been accused of loving a fruit bomb or two. Bonny Doon always delivers. Let me say that this big wine is rather light on its feet. Alluring nose of of violets, black licorice and graphite but the palate is where it really dances. Spicy red fruit and vanilla spice with a slap of acidity and a smooth dry finish. Proper structure and clarity with a balance of fruit and earth. Slow cooked wild boar sliders should be on the menu with this little surprising showstopper.

"This is going to be a knockout with K&L fans; highly regarded by Wine Enthusiast with the quality to show for. The fruit make up on the nose along with the woodsy spice is very reminiscent of Bordeaux, but with a California touch.

Full bodied, good fruit, lots of complexity, and, again, incredibly well balanced.

Where the Savannah tends towards the dry side, the New york tends towards the sweet. Where the Savannah is not bone dry, the New York is not super sweeet. It has a nose of candied oranges, coffee and candied bacon. Medium to full bodied. On the palate, toffee, date and hazelnuts. Like the Savannah, it is worth every cent!

"Don't be scared of the X-word here... this unoaked red changes expectations of Xinomavro with its firmly juicy, fresh and energetic style with carefully managed tannins. I've actually poured this instead of a summer white along with Mediterranean small-plate fare and it substituted beautifully when you would normally think a white would be ideal. It makes me respect the varietal all-the-more, with Xinomavro (similarly to Nebbiolo) showing capability on the treble end of the scale as well as the bass end. Certainly a value, this is a versatile and underappreciated style of red when something similarly priced like a Cote du Rhone perhaps isn't enough fun.

"This 2015 Poulsard from Domaine De L'Aigle is both rare and beautiful, and evolves in the glass from the moment you pour. From the onset, the nose is striking and extremely brushy and earthy, with a slightly gamey and intriguing undertone that absolutely sets this Jura Red apart from the crowd. Slightly fuller bodied and more extracted than many Poulsard based Jura wines, this is an incredible food wine and will stand up to, and complement, most meat dishes, adding extraordinary dimension to your dining experience.

"With ample flavors of ripe raspberries and blueberry coulis, this is a juicy, lip-smacking wine with a very respectable ABV of 13%. There is a touch of black pepper on the mid palate and energetic acidity to support the scrumptious fruit.

"As in Monty Python, ""now for something completely different"".  This highly unusual rose has a raspberry and tarragon nose.

"This is fantastic - one of my favorite rosé sparklers I've had this year. The secret to this cava's delicate pink color and fresh red berry fruit is a tiny portion of direct press Monastrell.

The Decoy California Rosé is such a delight, at an optimal price point, and it delivers, big time. The blend is unconventional, at fifty-eight percent Syrah and forty-two percent Pinot Noir, and the wine is expressive of this originality. Pale in color, the wine exhibits aromas of diatomaceous earth, light raspberry and boysenberry. The palate is mineral-driven and light, with deliciously balanced acidity and quite a bit of backbone, which makes it equally suited for cuisine or personal enjoyment.

Dow's style is relatively drier than most of the other houses, except perhaps Taylor's, and after 40 years of ageing, it has reached prime drinking: beautiful florals, perfectly sweet fruits and a graceful mouth feel all combine to make this one of the more memorable vintage ports I have yet to enjoy. A real treat, and a perfect gift to mark that 40th birthday or anniversary.

"Zweigelt is one of three varietals that are the main focus for the line of Rosi Schuster wines.  Founded in 1979, the estate is now helmed by Schuster's son, Hannes.  Working out of Burgenland, Austria's key red wine region, Hannes pursues small yields of exceptional fruit and allows both alcoholic and malolactic fermentation to occur spontaneously.  I tasted this wine after it had seen a good amount of air and it was full of lively, juicy fruit with smashed blackberries, cherries and red plums.  It's a little spicy and slightly bigger than the varietal is typically known for.  It would be a great pairing for anything remotely resembling the hearty dishes Austria is famous for, such as Spätzle and Schnitzel.  Fried chicken or a nice pork chop would be perfect for this.

The wine has structrure, good acidity and minerality but the flavors will win you over, it's a replay of the nose, balanced and focused, Dry and focused this is a wine you can have with lots of foods, BBQ chicken, grilled salmon and maybe even spaghetti carbonara.

"This really took us by surprise. Maybe it's that since most of the great rose wines we're familiar with hail from Spain, France or California, we don't have the same expectation when it comes to Italy. Regardless, this impressive gem from Calabria delivers earthy bright red fruit aromas and flavors along with juicy acidity and fine tannins that make this ideal with meats and heartier fare. ""Marinetto"" is made from 100% Gaglioppo and certainly brings intriguing character of Calabria to the table.
",Other Red Wines
"Absolutely delicious. Gaglioppo is a tannic varietal so the tannins are present here but they are very smooth. The nose is full of fun, fruity aromas like watermelon and cherry candy but on the palate you'll detect more spice and it maintains a pleasantly dry finish.

"This little known port house is actually one of the oldest, first founded in 1680 and held by the same family up until 1920 or so, at which point the Symington family (who own Graham's, Dow's, and Warre's) purchased it. This wine is in great shape, likely re-conditioned with what appears to be a newer cork. Relatively light on the palate, there is a perfectly balanced sweetness, notes of candied violet, lovely minerality and an overall sense of subtlety and elegant balance. Not a blockbuster, but rather a beauty, Quarles Harris also happens to be the most reasonably priced of our 1977 vintage ports.
",Other Red Wines
"Today was my first time tasting Quarles Harris vintage port and I must say, I am extremely impressed. The 1977 is defined by elegance and grace. The first shock was in the color. It's delicate, a clean and bright garnet. It's almost like a Pinot Noir. The aromatics are equally graceful with bright florals and sweet spices. The brandy is perfectly integrated into the wine lending just enough power to carry through the black berries but never overwhelming the fruit notes. From the all-time great 1977 vintageat 40 years old the Quarles Harris does not disappoint.

"If you drink rose often but have grown restless and want to spice things up a bit, this should fit the bill.

"Pipeño is a traditional style of wine, winemaking and wine drinking from Chile, especially from Southern Chile. Just to look at the raw material before digging into anything else about this wine should pique most people’s curiosity; 200+ year old Pias vines! Most commercial vineyards are old at 20 years! Most wines made from 100 year old vines are 4 times the price of this wine. For those whom this is important to, the vineyards are more than organically farmed. Additionally the wine is made with minimal intervention.  Fermentation is partial carbonic, done in traditional Rauli barrels with native yeasts. This qualifies it for most “natural wine” consumers. Meaning this wine has a little of that funk, but in the best way, I’ll get back to that later.As mentioned, Pipeño also refers to a style of drinking.  Taking young fresh wines, and mixing them with non alcoholic beverages, just to be enjoyed with food and good company.While this is not something to be mixed, it is light and refreshing and can go down as quickly and as enjoyably as any “spritzer”. Here is where I want to talk about that funk, it presents itself like a hint of vinegar, think like a shrub, a strawberry rosemary shrub!  This wine has soft dusty fruits, with slightly tangy acid, and just enough framing tannins.  It is fresh and savory and mouth watering, you cannot help yourself from going back and taking another sip. Being less than 12% alcohol abv, you will not feel bad about how fast the wine disappears.  While this may not be for everyone, this is not only a cork dork wine. Simply, this is an unusual wine that begs to be shared with good friends and good food.

Flavors of white nectarine, bosc pear, and golden delicious apple give way to a honey note on the finish. Lively and fresh, stock up on this for your next party or get-together

"This is one of our most popular sparkling wines throughout the year because it is delicious and super affordable. Now with the prospect of holiday parties, get-togethers, and long evenings, this is the perfect everyday bubbly. Stone fruit, citrus notes, a creamy mouthfeel, and lots of tiny bubbles mean this wine can be the start of any evening.
",Other White Wines
"One of the most consistent questions people pose in regards to sparkling wines is: is it dry? If the answer is essentially ""not really"" in regards to many lower priced sparklers, with the Deligeroy Brut one can happily answer in the affirmative! Light biscuity, nutty and lemon scents are right on point, and the finish has all the snap you want from a bottle of bubbly.
",Other White Wines
"It's toasty and light, floral and fruity, drinkable and inexpensive.  Enough said, right?  While lovely all by itself, it's also a bottle that you don't feel guilty adding a dash of crème de cassis to for a brunch-time sparkling cocktail.
",Other White Wines
"Much like its cousin, the Deligeroy Rosé, this is just way too easy to say yes to. A fantastic and inexpensive replacement for those of you who love Champagne but hate the price. A great choice for a mid-morning glass of bubbly...

"What a screaming deal at $11.99! This bubbly from the Loire Valley will delight you with its refreshingly pleasant acidity, fine bubble structure, and hints of pear, apple and minerals. Chenin Blanc, Chardonnay & Cabernet Franc. When I first brought this wine home, I admittedly had intended to just mix it with my Mathilde Cassis for a Kir Royale, but I wanted to give the wine its proper due and poured a glass out straight first. A wonderful surprise met me, and I never did add that cassis.... the wine somehow disappeared too quickly! Perfect for holiday entertaining!

"On the nose you will find generous fruit, releasing hints of apples and peaches. The palate has wonderful balance and elegance, dry & crisp, but admirable fullness and length, closely mirroring the nose. This is an excellent aperitif for all social occasions.

"The region of Saumur in the Loire Valley of France is the largest producer of sparkling wines outside of Champagne. This blend of Chenin Blanc, Chardonnay, and Cabernet Franc is an astonishing value at $11.99. Dry and crisp in style with a rich, creamy texture. Affordable by the case for a special event. Inexpensive enough to enjoy guilt-free any night of the week. Sante!
",Other White Wines
"Its a beautiful thing to have an exceptional sparkler for an amazing price! This is always one of my favorites to always keep on hand at home because it is so fresh, minerally, with crisp acidity, elegant zesty bubbles, what more could you ask for from the Loire Valley? Its perfect day and night!
",Other White Wines
"This is the quintessential bottle of bubbles one is required to always have in the fridge.  Done in a zippy blanc de blancs style, the Deligeroy Cremant de Loire offers up aromas of sweet lemon and light apricot followed my an aggressive palate of tiny racy bubbles.  Perfect for toasting the New Year's!
",Other White Wines
"It's finally back in stock after months of waiting!  My favorite Champagne look-alike, the Deligeroy Cremant de Loire, is a must for entertaining. However, it is also sophisticated enough to stand on its own as an apertif, gift for a sparkling wine lover, or simply as a bottle to share with someone special. The blend of Chenin and Chardonnay provide floral and mineral aromatics as well as weight and a backbone of refreshing acidity; Cabernet Franc adds complexity and fruit notes. A no-brainer this holiday season, but with this sparkler on hand, any reason is an excuse to celebrate!
",Other White Wines
"A customer came in recently and asked for an elegant, delicate sparkling wine for a wedding celebration. Champagne was beyond his budget, so without hesitation I smiled and recommended this Cremant de Loire, arguably the greatest sparkling wine value in the world. Created with precise restrictions on everything from mandatory hand-harvesting of relatively older vines to aging regimens (a minimum of 12 months) to atmospheres of pressure (3.5 as opposed to 6 for Champagne), the Deligeroy is a finely-beaded beauty, discreetly aromatic, lacy and effervescent. The careful assemblage of Chenin Blanc, Chardonnay and Cabernet Franc adds aromatic complexity, giving this wine an added degree of sophistication. Highly recommended!
",Other White Wines
"This light and effervescent Cremant is a great party apperitif! A delicate apricot undertone with vibrant acidity, this sparkling goes down fast and easy!

"At a measly $15 a bottle, this gorgeous blend from Limoux (a region with an older sparkling wine tradition than even Champagne) is more compelling than countless over-priced bottles from the more famous region. The fineness of the bubbles lend a mousy texture and the flavor profile offers crunchy strawberry, orange rind, watermelon, a pretty floral nuance, and terroir-driven minerality that reveals why this unsung region for bubbles is actually one of the best kept secrets of France's wine industry. Perfect with turkey, no matter how you prepare it on Thanksgiving; roasted, fried, or smoked, this will be a refreshing and perfectly-calibrated companion.
",Other White Wines
"A delightful sparkler that is nothing short of  fun. Notes of  strawberries and pretty white flowers jump out of the glass. The palate offers a rich but delicate cherry and herbal appeal. This is perfect for a house sparkling wine or for your next party.

"The 2014 Antech “Emotion” Brut Rosé is my own personal workhorse bubbly. I’m a sucker for rosé and this delivers on all fronts. With plenty of cherry and Arkansas black apple flavor, it is more structured and full-bodied. It is easily their best rosé to date.
",Other White Wines
"With an older history of sparkling wine than in Champagne this delightful bottle of bubbly from Limoux is a perfect house wine. Lovely white floral notes with a hint of tart cherry and watermelon bring a delicate flavor to the crisp acidity of the wine. Light and clean enough for an aperitif, this wine still has enough going on to pair beautifully with everything from fish to spicy noodle dishes. This is one of those wines that many of our customers already know and love because the taste far exceeds the price tag.

"Are you tired of winter and dreaming of warmer days? If your answer is yes, then pop open a bottle Quinta Da Aveleda. This Vinho Verde is extremely fresh and refreshing. Nice tropical fruit welcomes your palate, while juicy acid keeps you coming back for more. This is a dry light bodied wine that is slightly effervescent making it the best adult soda around. Cheers!
",Other White Wines
"A blend of Loureiro and Alvarinho, this Portugese white is the ideal aperitif. Dry and crisp in style and low in alcohol, this light-bodied wine neither tires nor dulls the senses but rather enlivens and refreshes. Lightly floral with bright citrus notes, there is a slight effervescence here that only emphasizes the wine's youthful exuberance.
",Other White Wines
"What a charming Vinho Verde from Quinta Da Aveleda! This is the perfect wine for a Summer apertif, and a fabulous accompaniment to lighter dishes like Ceviche, salads and light pasta and fish dishes. With notes of lemon, underripe peach and a hint of pear, this wine is fresh and uncomplicated. Guaranteed to go down easy and dry, with minerality to spare.

"The white wines of Italy never disappoint. Fresh, flavorsome, and mouth watering with notes of stone fruit, white flowers, and a hint of salinity, this bottle of Trebbiano has beautiful succulence while retaining bright, zippy acidity that will have you reaching for that third glass. Enjoy with cioppino, chicken, pork and good friends. Bevi, amici!
",Other White Wines
"This wine excites me: the nose is floral, spicy, and a bit of beeswax and honey flow from the glass. On the palate the wine has weight and a distinct richness yet you immediately feel the snap of acidity, that vibrant center-palate zing that just lights up your mouth, and a rarity to find wines that have that richness but are so clean on the palate, and at only 13.0%. The flavors are spice, lees, braised fruit, all offset by the focused central acidity that add lift and drive to the palate presence. The finish is long, mineral driven, and shows incredible balance; layers of fruit, spice and floral notes are consistently blossoming in the finish. This Lugana Limne is capable of aging very well for another 2-4 years, the Riserva up to 10 years.
",Other White Wines
"Tenuta Roveglia is the most recent addition to our Italian direct import portfolio and their wines are already turning heads. My colleague Greg St. Clair alerted me some time ago as to just how impressive Roveglia's Luganas were and he was right. Over the years I've found most Lugana to be either a bit lean or conversely more akin to oaky new world Chardonnay with few rising above. Neither is the case with Roveglia. Their ""Limne"" is a value priced Lugana that weds crisp acidity with flavorful honeyed fruit and is vibrant on the palate from start to finish. We were expecting this to retail closer to $20 and were astonished to find otherwise. This versatile white drinks nicely as an aperitif but will pair nicely with shellfish, white meats and lighter Asian style dishes. Impressive.
",Other White Wines
"A great amount of effort and care goes into Aspasie’s Carte Blanche, and it is instantly clear when you taste it.  Low temperature macerated in small volume, then lightly filtered and aged for at least five years on the lees, it is a true wonder that the cost is not much higher than it is. Bright, pure flavors of Anjou pear, granny smith apple, toasted pastry dough, and hisbiscus, with a light creamy texture and crisp acidity.
",Other White Wines
"Probably my most favorite champagne ever! When people call in asking for something delicious, fresh and easy to drink, and not a lot of money, this is the first thing I look for inventory on. I can always get behind this and know it will be a huge hit. This recent bottling comes across as a little more complex, with a little more richness than the last bottling. Don't get me wrong, it's still fresh, and bright, but there's a real mineral backbone to it. The mouth-feel is more substantial this time around and I can't help but think that it's growing into an even more serious version of itself. Incredible value!
",Other White Wines
"Ever since I had this wine at my wedding in 2008, it has been getting more and more impressive.  This current cuvee is the most amazing value yet in a truly first class Champagne.  You owe it to yourself to try one if you haven't yet. My number one pick of Champagne values in the store!
",Other White Wines
"Just when I thought I couldn’t love Aspasie more, they charm us at the annual Champagne Tent Event AND make improvements to their production facilities that send Carte Blanche over the top in elegance and quality. The current release of Carte Blanche still spends five years on the lees, and has the biscuity notes to prove it, but shows even crisper acidity. Paul-Vincent Ariston is committed to making exceptional entry level wine, and there’s no doubt he’s accomplished that here. A traditional cépage of 40% Chardonnay and 30% each of Pinot Noir and Meunier, the Carte Blanche shows apple and crunchy pear fruit, tempered by underlying chalky notes, mousse texture, and a toasty finish. This is a bright spot in our DI Champagne line up – both figuratively and stylistically – and I love turning savvy drinkers on to this value-driven, family-owned favorite.
",Other White Wines
"The ""Carte Blanche"" Ariston Aspasie bottling is a mere $27.99 for real Champagne. This allows you to buy well crafted Champagne that is made within the strict rules of the Champagne region at a very reasonable price. This Champagne has richness but is very light in feel. Nice green apple flavors, brioche and vanilla bean, chalky with a mousse texture. Just lovely.
",Other White Wines
"This Champagne is TRUE value and TRUE pleasure! The work and time spent on making this alone is worth more than $27.99. It shows aromas of sourdough yeast and crisp green apple on the palate. The price allows one to buy a case for all the celebrating to be done from now until next year.
",Other White Wines
"This is absolutely incredible Champagne for the money! Deeply flavored, intense and powerful it is in the style of Bollinger and Krug at nowhere near the price and I love that!

"Caroline and Paul-Vincent Ariston rank up there with some of the best people I know in the world. Their Champagnes rank up there as one of my favorite wines at K & L. In my house we have to have a case on hand of the Carte Blanche at all times. The Ariston’s facility is ultra-modern, employing a super efficient diagonal press & temperature controlled stainless steel tanks. On my trip to Champagne this was by far my favorite place to visit, and I made friends for life. The current release of the Carte Blanche is fresh and youthful. It provides fresh baked apples and a toasty quality that I attribute to the terroir of the Ariston’s surrounding land and air. One sip and I am reminded of this wonderful place and that great Champagne does not have to cost a fortune.

"January is freedom. Freedom from the holiday hustle, freedom from all the rich food, freedom from the in-laws. Celebrate your freedom with one of the best Champagne values in town, Aspasie Carte Blanche. Thanks to the investment in a fancy Coquard grape press, and thermo-regulated fermentation tanks, the quality of this Champagne has never been better! So as you come out of the holiday haze into some lighter eating, more fresh-air and a bit of financial frugality, look no further than this crazy good value packed bottle from our friends the Aristons - at Champagne House Aspasie!
",Other White Wines
"I've always been a fan of this wine since we started bringing it in way back in 2001. It's always been the top price performer for the price point, but when I tasted the latest batch I did a double take. I had to ask Gary Westby if he had poured me the right wine, and he nodded at me and said ya, you figured it out, this batch is out of this world! There isn't a Champagne around that can compete at this price point with the Carte Blanche, layers of complex brioche, wonderful aromatics...wow.
",Other White Wines
"Excellent bubbles at an excellent price! For those of you who like Veuve Clicquot, this effort from Ariston has ample yeast and toast but, not too much. Golden apple fruit and hints of caramel and vanilla. Great by itself or with chicken, salmon or pork. Update: 12/22/2017-As is standard with this gem, it still has that bread dough, yeast and toast quality but, this latest version has a nice hint of zippy acidity, minerals, and lemon curd. Also, still retains that caramel and vanilla bean background. Buy some to drink and some to lay down for a year or so. The caramel comes out even more as it ages!
",Other White Wines
"If you ask any K&L staff member for a champagne recommendation, this is most likely the bottle they will instinctively reach for. Why? Because this is the wine that time and again has graced our own tables, marked our celebrations, and found its way, more often than not, into our weekly wine diet. This is undeniably one of the best values for true champagne that we offer. The wine is both approachable and layered, with distinctive toast and brioche notes complementing the orchard fruit on the palate.  Whether you need some bubbles for your dinner tonight, you want to gift a friend with something special, or you're celebrating with your family, you really can't go wrong with this wine. Enjoy with us!

"***Update: One of the best Champagnes in the store just got even better! Many years ago the Ariston family made significant investments in their family winery including a new press and temp controlled fermentation tanks. As with many things in life good things take time and so finally after 5 years resting on the lees, the latest batch of Aspasie Carte Blanche contains base wines crafted after the winery made these improvements. All this means a wine that was always one of the best QPRs in the store is now even more pure and polished than ever.***
",Other White Wines
"I know what you might be thinking: ""I've had the Ariston Aspasie Carte Blanche dozens of times at this point."" I've consumed at least 100 bottles of this in my 10 years at K&L, but unless you've bought a bottle post-November 2017 then you haven't had the new and improved Carte Blanche. You can look at my colleague Gary Westby's review for the technical details, but the short version is that the technological advancements put into place six years ago at Aspasie are just now showing up in the bottle, after five years of lees aging. If you thought you were getting a bargain for a sub-$30 Champagne before, you're getting a better version today. The control that the Aspasies have over the fermentation and pressing now results in a much fresher wine. More dynamic on the palate, cleaner on the finish, and livelier in every way, my most recent experience with the Carte Blanche was like drinking it again for the first time. If it's been a while since your last bottle of Aspasie Carte Blanche, you may want to consider revisiting this soon.
",Other White Wines
"I can't think of a single bottle of Champagne at K&L that has brought me such consistent pleasure as the Ariston Aspasie Carte Blanche. The Ariston family has worked very hard to deliver this great bottle to the Champagne lovers of the world. Most producers age their Champagne for less than three years in the bottle before shipping, but the Carte Blanche gets five years. It is entirely estate grown by one of the most careful growers in the business. On top of all that it is made in one of the most modern facilities of any small producer that I have visited. The pressing is done in a 1/4 million euro Coquard diaganol press and the fermentation is all done in computer regulated temperature controlled tanks. The result is one of the best aperitif bottles that we sell; toasty and full, yet refreshing and crisp, a perfect balance between aged complexity and youthful vigor. And then there is the price--so fair that Cinnamon and I have had the opportunity to impact the world supply with our consumption! Don't miss it.
",Other White Wines
"A great mousse, clean apple, subtle cherry. Lovely freshness with a distinct bready top note. Rare to find a better value than this in Champagne, the Ariston's commitment to quality is second to none and thanks to our DI relationship, we're selling this at Cremant prices!

"I'll be the first to admit it. I grew up somewhat spoiled. When it came to things that really mattered, like what movie to rent, I pretty much had CARTE BLANCHE. Unfortunately, that freedom and joy absolutely PALED IN COMPARISON to the delight that I encountered upon my first taste of this gorgeous bottling from one of our long-time favorite Champagne producers. Composed of almost-equal shares of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Pinot Meunier,there's simply too much to love here: Bright traces of apple; the present-yet-balanced yeast; and the toastiness that I absolutely require in champagne. Simply remarkable, it is, to find a wine so complex and meticulously crafted for such a price!
",Other White Wines
"Update: This wine continues to amaze me year after year. Each time I open a bottle I marvel at the quality of the wine for the price tag. Re-reading my review from 2011, I have tasted hundreds of different bottles of Champagne, and this bottle of wine still makes me incredibly happy. With 6 years on the lees, the integration is wonderful, soft mouth feel, ripe orchard fruit, toasty at the back. Still good after all these years. Wonderfully balanced bubbles for a wonderfully balanced price tag. The Carte Blanche is my most often used excuse to open bubbles just for the sake of having a glass of Champagne, there are always a couple of bottles stashed away around my house. Powerfully elegant, with toasted nutty notes and a length on the finish that reasserts why I love this wine.
",Other White Wines
"The rich, deep, golden yellow color of the Ariston Aspasie Carte Blanche is a tiny hint at the expressive, and explosive purity fruit that lies within this cuvee of 40% Chardonnay, 30% Pinot Noir and 30% Meunier.  Very few Champagnes have the amount of chalky minerality that is present in the Carte Blanche, let alone a cuvee that is priced less than $30!  What’s even more impressive than the amount of minerality is the broad, rich texture that lets everyone know how perfectly this Champagne with pair with foods of all fairs.
",Other White Wines
"It is remarkable to me, and to much of our wine staff, some of the unique, profoundly produced Champagnes from the small producers that Gary Westby, our Champagne Wine Buyer, has discovered over the last decade. Virtually all of these producers, including the Aristons, are making sparkling wine strictly from estate fruit from Grand Cru recognized vineyard sites, and in small lots. As with any small producer, these wines are “hands-on” creations that are given extensive individual attention and long term aging before being disgorged. The Ariston “Carte Blanche’s” exquisite, superb quality is at a mind boggling low price vis-à-vis its style and complexity.  Rich and authoritative both on its nutty, doughy yeasty nose and in the mouth, the very fine mousse leads to an amazingly rich, full style brut, with a long, intense finish.  Some of you will probably not enjoy this Gem, due to the fact that you have gotten use to flavorless, bulk productions from the international, well-known, simply made name “brands,” but for those of you that seek complexity and profoundness in your Champagne, you will not find one even close in quality to this Gem at this price. The Guys (Rusty, Eby, The Beaner, and Rizzo) have forcefully made this our house sparkling wine forever. Don't be afraid to age this wonderful Champagne; it will only keep getting better. ABV 12%
",Other White Wines
"I think the Ariston Aspasie Carte Blanche Brut was one of the first grower-producer Champagnes I ever purchased from K&L. It remains to this day our best value in Champagne, and a superb introduction to the grower producer (RM) Champagnes. If your usual Champagne experience is Veuve Clicquot or Moet & Chandon, you owe it to yourself to try the Carte Blanche from Paul-Vincent Ariston. With roughly equal parts of the three classic Champagne grapes, and a retail price comfortably south of $30, this is a no-brainer. Open a bottle for no reason in the middle of the week. You'll feel like royalty.
",Other White Wines
"Carte Blanche is always tasty, a Champagne with a soft bead, nice toast, crowd appeal and great value. This current batch, though, based on the very strong 2008 vintage, is impressive. Brighter than usual, with great purity and tasty fruit, easily the most impressive batch we have received. I'd be happy with this at $40, but for $28 it's one of our great values right now.

"Vines have been cultivated on this tiny property in the hamlet of Brouillet for five generations, and it has remained a customer and staff favorite here for several years.  Yeasty, full and complex, the Carte Blanche exhibits a fine intensely-focused bead with lively notes of tart apples, dried hazelnuts, vanilla and toast, all in all a remarkably well-built Brut that will compare well to cuvées at double the price. It is perfect for entertaining.

"Unfortunately I missed the rare opportunity to meet Philippe Guigal during his recent visit to Los Angeles, as my work and pleasure lie to the north in our San Francisco store. But I can attest to the phenomenal  range and excellence of his wines, from humble Cotes du Rhone blends to his incomparable, world-class Cote-Roties. And the 2015 vintage has left many folks searching for superlatives to describe near perfection, a year that turned out wines of incredible aromatic charm, finesse and balance. Hold that humility: the Blanc resonates with elegant notes of ripe stone fruit--juicy apricots, white peaches, glistening pears, enlivened by flamboyant acacia and honeysuckle aromas. A super wine to be enjoyed with any number of dishes, extravagant in every way except the price!
",Other White Wines
"Viognier lovers take note--this is an exceptional blend that has all of those stone fruit flavors and a surprising elegance. The aromatics of this wine really took me by surprise: tons of peach, apricot and pear come singing out of the glass. There is definitely some weight here along with a rich texture. The acid is medium-low, but not atypical for viognier, which makes up 60% of the blend. I hadn't had this wine in years and have forgotten what a stellar value it is. This one’s definitely going on my regular take-home list.
",Other White Wines
"A recent staff seminar with Philippe Guigal in our Los Angeles store put this extraordinary value back on our staff's palates.  Now, Philippe is one of the rock stars of the Rhone and its hard not to fall in love with his wines when he is showing them to you.  So, this down-to-earth, laid back guy is all about the quality of their production at all levels.  And where it especially shows is with this charming gulpable white.  The 2015 has something just a little more intriguing than an average year and perhaps it's because Viognier was especially aromatic this vintage and makes up a greater percentage of the blend.  With Philippe guiding us through our tasting, we also examined his new 2015 Condrieu (Stunning!) as well as the 2011 Gigondas, 2010 Chateauneuf and 2012 Cote Rotie.  But, I kept coming back to the Cotes du Rhone Blanc.  It had so much of the nuance of the far more expensive white but was just so...drinkable.  And what a perfect time too, this white exudes notes of nectarine, pear and jasmine.  It's like spring time in a glass.  Serve this little beauty with aromatic foods.  What a perfect foil for Indian, Thai and Chinese!  Or keep it simple and do a little salad of poached tuna, roasted peppers and aioli.  No matter what, you'll want this as one of your best seasonal go-to whites.

"White Rioja certainly deserves to be better known than it is. And here is an excellent way to delve into this delightful category! This wine is made by a pair of brothers working in a small winery in northern Rioja, and is composed entirely of Viura.

"The 2008 champagnes have been killing it with their pop, pizzazz and ageability. This Grand Vintage from Brun de Neuville, the first vintage we have carried from them here at k&l, encompasses the same clean, fresh acidity we love from the vintage with a pure salinity and touch of candied citrus peel. The wine is mostly Chardonnay and spent 8 years on its lees which added some nice texture and width to the focused vintage. A pinch of Pinot Noir seconds the character of lees aging and adds just a bit of fineness on the nose. This is a wine for the ages!

"The 2008 vintage for champagne is tasting really amazing right now, and this 2008 Grand Vintage Brut should be on your list, if you're looking for a fantastic bottle of vintage champagne.

"Of course the great '08 Vintage Champagne from anywhere is in high demand, but once a few customers get to try this beauty it should disappear quickly.

"This was one of the biggest highlights of my trip to Champagne this year. This spectacular offering from  Le Brun De Neuville is all from Bethon, in the heart of the Sézanne. It is composed of 96% of Chardonnay and 4% Pinot Noir from some of the chalkiest soil in all of Champagne. You friends will not believe that they are drinking a Champagne that is well under $50 if you pop this tonight. Given how well the 1988 Le Brun De Neuville showed, it only can get better if you can keep your hands off of it!

"Bright and poised pear, apple and lemon zest fruit flavors with a voluptuous mid-palate texture and just a hint of red fruit from the Pinot Noir on the back end.  The acidity, like every vintage 2008 Champagne I’ve had so far, is electric and stimulating, amplifying the fruit flavors for an almost never-ending finish.  Incredible value from this grower champagne from what is quickly becoming a legendary vintage.
",Other White Wines
"This is absolutely DELICIOUS Champagne, a stunning specimen of the 2008 vintage. It's the total package. A vibrant nose of honeyed fruit and rich brioche, backed up by more richness on the palate, with a firm mineral note ballasted by a backbone of zippy acidity all the way through. The bubbles are fine and graceful across the palate with oxidized nuttiness on the finish. This is one helluva deal. Buy it for a special occasion and wow your friends. It tastes much more expensive than it is.

"This sets the bar for spectacular brut rosé! It’s hard to gush about Billecart-Salmon without feeling like you’re piggybacking on critical accolades or following popular opinion, but this best-selling Champagne is worth the hype. Gorgeous rose petal and delicate white peach on the nose, followed by pure strawberry fruit gleaming through the palate, this showcases Billecart-Salmon’s bright style while adding the sophistication of mousse texture and a minerally finish. There’s freshness throughout, plus substance – this would be a great wine to pair with heartier meals like fried chicken, although its elegance makes a glass equally at home with caviar. Tiny creamy bubbles and lovely color only enhance the drinking experience, and cooler, longer fermentation in stainless steel (3-5 weeks!) keeps everything crisp. Billecart-Salmon uses all three big Champagne varietals: Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and curiously, more Pinot Meunier than most houses. They have traditionally championed Meunier and the result is a delicate, nuanced wine with depth.  Perfect for any occasion, even if that occasion is a weeknight spent on an apartment balcony, Billecart-Salmon Brut Rosé Champagne is reliably special.
",Other White Wines
"This is the benchmark in rose Champagne, and it deserves every bit of its fame. I find it elegant and balanced every time that I have it, and the blushing pink color is always perfect. If you are looking for a famous producer that delivers the goods, the Billecart Salmon Brut Rose Champagne is a great choice. I like the wine best as an aperitif, the only thing it need to pair with is a good glass.
",Other White Wines
"If I could pick any Champagne to drink on a daily basis regardless of price, it would be the Beautiful Billecart Salmon Rose! Without a doubt your last sip will still taste as good as the first. And your obsession will start at your first sip. This is a clean and elegant style that will impress just about any level Champagne drinker

"Next to the legendary 2002 vintage Krug, this 2004 is also a star. Very, very, bright with generous acidity that combines with white stone fruit and almond flavors. It still retains the elegant mousse and brioche of classic vintage Krug, but, the acidity is the star player here. Super fresh, and clean, and bracing. This bottling has the potential of being the star of your cellar and may even overshadow the 2002 eventually.  If you prefer to drink it without cellar time, give it a few minutes to air in your glass so that the glorious texture has a chance to come out and say ""hi"". The 2004 is a classic and will be remembered as being one of  Krug's best!
",Other White Wines
"I was lucky enough to taste the Krug 2004 Vintage right next to the Krug Grand Cuvee Edition 160 - which has 2004 as its foundation. It was a joy to contemplate the artistry of both approaches. The Grand Cuvee featuring the expert blending of reserve wines back to 1990 to create the top expression of this house.  Contrasted with the purity of the 2004 Vintage. A glimpse into that particular growing season, like a portrait representing a moment in time that will be referred back-to again and again. The 2004 Vintage is exquisite, vibrant and fresh - a prime candidate for cellar ageing. And when compared to some of  its peers from other regions like Burgundy or Bordeaux, a supreme value!
",Other White Wines
"The latest vintage release from Krug since the legendary 2002 release is a different animal altogether.  It comes from a vintage that fully benefited from the poor crop output of 2003, using the unspent energy for amazing crop yields across Champagne in 2004.  It offers fineness, intensity, complexity and real aging power.  Upon its release, some 13 years after production, it is vibrantly youthful and fresh, with nuanced notes of citrus, yeasty toast, saffron and dried apricots.  This will go for many more years.
",Other White Wines
"Tasting the new 2004 Krug next to the 2002 was a revelation for me. This has the power and mid-palate presence that we all love from this great house, but it is married to the extraordinary freshness, minerality and purity of the 2004 vintage. As soon as I touched my lips to the glass I was transported back to the moment over a decade ago when I tasted the 1988 on release. The 2004s and 1988s are like peas in a pod, and I think this will be a vintage that collectors will be kicking themselves for not paying enough attention to. The finish on this bright, lively Krug is still with me the morning after drinking it. It is a Champagne for the ages.

"This truly is one of the best values in sparkling wine we have.  It's fresh, crisp and drinks well above it's price.  Dry with small bubbles and an elegant mouth feel, it goes down (almost) too easily.  Notes of green apple, stone fruits and a slight nutty richness make this an easy choice for any occasion!

"For my money, Cava like Mas Codina stands head-and-shoulders above more popular, expensive, but less polished sparkling wines. The bubbles are finer, creating a mousse-y texture on the palate, while the flavors of nectarine, baked apple, and subtle flowers are balanced and restrained in a way that avoids any cloyingness. At only $12.99, this is an incredible value with truly romantic expression perfect for any intimate occasion.
",Other White Wines
"This is one of the best bottle of bubbles in the store for its price. The fact that we directly import this sparkler and that it is from Spain means that it drinks far and above its price point. This Cava is very clean and enhanced by bright acid while still having some weight and richness on the mouthfeel. A lovely balance of ripe fruit and citrus make this one that can easily turn heads at a party and is priced to keep a case around the house.

"Everyone loves a good value in sparkling wine. We would all love to drink Champagne every night, but sometimes you want to spend a little less without compromising quality. For that reason, our buyers here at K&L strive to provide a broad range of alternatives at affordable prices. Over time certain of these have become so popular among our customers and staff that they have achieved an almost iconic status, the kind of wine people buy by the case – among others the Louis Bouillot Cremant de Bourgogne ""Perle d'Aurore"" Brut Rosé, the Deligeroy Cremant de Loire Brut, and the Mas Codina Cava Brut Reserva Penedès. This classic Spanish cava combines traditional grape varieties like Xarello and Macabeo with those more likely to be found in Champagne like Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. 24 months on the lees adds richness and weight. At this price you can treat yourself whenever you like.
",Other White Wines
"This is one of our greatest ""value"" sparkling wines in the company. It is very well balanced and has a lingering finish. The overall character of golden apple fruit, with a hint of nuttiness and tart cherries, is balanced by a very clean finish that contains citrus notes and minerals. It has 10 grams per liter dosage, enough to keep it dry but, to add some light fruitiness, as well. Something here to please nearly everyone!
",Other White Wines
"Clean and bright with a soft, elegant mouthfeel, this gorgeous Cava evokes stonefruit without being cloyingly aromatic - more crisp nectarine than peach - and finishes dry. A bottle of this quality goes down so easily, you'll be amazed (and your wallet grateful) that it's less than $14.  Time to celebrate!

"A sparkling wine this well constructed for under $15 could only be from Spain. This Cava would not be out of place side-by-side with wines almost double the price. I keep a bottle in my refrigerator at all times.

"The Mas Codina Cava is easily a top sparkler in the store at $14. It is the house sparkling wine for most of our staff and has even been the wedding sparkler of choice, which speaks to the quality! Well balanced with a touch of red fruit from the pinot, green apple skin, beautiful mineral qualities, and a dry finish.
",Other White Wines
"This is no ordinary Cava.  There is a good percentage of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay are used in the blend.  What that means is that there is breadth and depth to this sparkler that you do not find in similarly priced Cavas.  Mix that with clean fruit tones, a moderate amount of yeastiness and a classic Brut finish and you get one of K&L's best sparkling values.
",Other White Wines
"Mas Codina is a humble family operation, and man do they make delicious sparkling wine! They have been slowly ramping up the amount of Pinot Noir in their otherwise traditional cava blend, in order to gain a bit more in color and mid-palate presence. These are very drinkable cavas, wines that strike a great balance between ripe, bright, snappy fruit, weight, and  texture. For under $14, the detail and value of this wine is undeniable.
",Other White Wines
"The Mas Codina cleaves more to the doughy-yeasty side of things, but has a light, delicate fruit character, in a citrus, tart apple vein. This definitely comes across on the dry side, and finishes clean, with a suggestion of green apple. Absolutely affordable, and well balanced, this is a great pick when you need good, inexpensive fizz!

"One of my favorite producers from Rias Baixas is a smaller winery called Adegas Valtea. Their Albarino comes from a vineyard slightly more inland than the bigger producers, but still very much influenced by the coastal climate.

Dry, refreshing, gorgeous finish - it's perfect for special occasions, though at this price, any night can be transformed.
",Other White Wines
"Of all the Antech wines, this is the cultiest and possibly my favorite.  Not everyone is drawn to this for its bright brined apple, crispy jicama and crunchy pear flavors.  I am though, because this is the ultimate aperitif sparkler.  So crisp and racy, this is the goods.  Serve it with fresh shucked oysters, crab salad, or maybe a little uni.
",Other White Wines
"Zero is my favorite number, or rather ‘un-number’ when it comes to most sparkling wines, as I prefer the naked, pure, crystalline fruit unadorned by added dosage, and the sheer raciness and zing of this stainless fermented bubbly from Limoux answers the call with laser flavors of green apple, lemon and white pear. Bring on a platter of fresh raw oysters or mussels mariniere and watch the shells pile up. Gotta love it!
",Other White Wines
"Almost Chablis-like in its austerity and crispness, the Blanquette shows flavors of Granny Smith apples, seashell minerality, and Meyer lemon.

"Bubble heads who really enjoy a brisk and crisp sparkler need look no further.

"The Limoux area of the Languedoc in southern France is the oldest sparkling wine producing region in the world, predating even Champagne. Blanquette is made mostly from the local variety Mauzac, which adds a delightfully crisp, fresh apple quality. The remainder is Chenin Blanc and Chardonnay.

"""Most of the world credits the invention of sparkling wine to the Champagne region, and to Dom Perignon. The legend, and possible real story, is far more interesting.

"The wine in this bottle is aged on the cork, a rather uncommon method of aging Champagne that imparts unique flavors otherwise absent from other bottles that don't incorporate this technique. What comes through is round, baked apple hugged by salted, honeyed nuts, graham cracker, and shades of briny minerality that vaguely resembles dry sherry. At this price point, this grower bottling is one of the best and most unique Champagne values in the shop... or anywhere.

"At a recent staff tasting of Champagne I thought that this product really stood out.

"One of my favorite things about tasting Champagne, besides the fact that I absolutely love Champagne, is the wide range of styles and flavor profiles you experience.

This is definitely one of my new favorite direct imports!
",Other White Wines
"We have so many wonderful Champagnes to choose from, that when one stands out I just have to tell everyone about it. The first word that comes to mind when I think of this Champagne is ""balance,"" where all the components are in the right places. This is evolution in a flute. On the nose, the freshness is bright and lovely. It gains some weight after the second sip and becomes creamy on the mid-palate, due to 5 years aging on the lees. Then it has an extra long, intense finish, with a slightly tart aftertaste—as one gets from eating tropical fruit.

"I just can't believe Gary keeps pulling these magical DI Champagnes out of god knows where! He's a magician after all. This is ultra complex for the price, savory with out being stinky or funky.

"In a direct import program that boasts hundreds of stunning grower-producer Champagnes at incredible values, the “Authentic Assemblage” from Le Brun de Neuville belongs near the top of the list not just in terms of value for the price but in overall quality.  It boasts a rich, decadent style that comes from aging on its lees for five years under cork instead of bottle cap, a practice still used by only a tiny percentage of producers in Champagne.  This allows for micro-oxygenation, which gives the wine a rich, rounded texture that perfectly balances out the crisp chalky minerals and the rich flavors of nectarine, honeysuckle, brioche and clove. The fact that it is available under $35 is a Champagne miracle.
",Other White Wines
"Bright but also mushroomy, earthy and slightly oxidative thanks to aging five years on the cork – an intensive process normally reserved for Tête de Cuvées of big houses (Bollinger Grande Année comes to mind) – this is an incredible value that encompasses (seemingly) conflicting qualities, all in the same glass.  Creamy but lively with elegant acid, rounded yet crisp fruit, plus chalky undertones and a subtle nuttiness, the “Authentique Assemblage” nevertheless drinks cleanly through to the finish. This multifaceted Direct Import is a high-quality Champagne from a talented winemaker:  Le Brun de Neuville was one of the biggest hits at our Los Angeles Champagne Tent Event, and after taking home a bottle, it’s easy to see why.
",Other White Wines
"La Maison Le Brun de Neuville is one of the top producers in the Côte de Sézanne. This lesser known region of Champagne is sometimes dismissed as merely a southward extension of the Côte des Blancs, but to do so is to ignore the unique character and exceptional quality of these wines. The Le Brun de Neuville Authentique Assemblage is aged under cork for five years, a practice that requires manual disgorgement using a centuries old technique. The result is Champagne that is rich in style with an ultra-fine bead, opulent yet focused, creamy in texture yet very fresh and lively. Rarely available in the US. Don’t miss your chance to sample the best of this remarkable region.

"The Authentique Assemblage from Le Brun De Neuville definitely drinks well above its price. Aged 5 years on the lees, this wine expresses baked apple spice and nutty flavors with fresh acidity resulting in a very well-balanced, delicious bottle of bubbles. For champagne that is made with all estate fruit and lees aging, you can't go wrong for 35 bucks.
",Other White Wines
"Lovely lemon meringue nose with baked apples and caramel. Initially, a note of bright acidity in the mouth that segues into toasted nuts, ripe apples, yellow pears and butterscotch.

"This a fantastic new entry to our DI Champagne program that offers fresh and clean flavors balanced and buoyed by riper apple notes. It's both refreshing as an aperitif and satisfyingly full on the palate like I would expect from a fine cuvee. What's most important to note, however, is that the Neuville ""Authentique"" stands out from the pack of K&L selections I've grown accustomed to drinking over the years. It's snappier than the Aspasie Carte Blanche, fruitier than the Bonville Blanc de Blanc, and more complex than the Baron Fuente Grand Reserve; generally my three go-to bottles. I'm now adding the Neuville into that line-up as the fourth horseman as it's just so versatile. Also intriguing is the wine's origin from Sezanne; a part of Champagne I know nothing about, so it scratches an intellectual itch as well. A great find by Gary.
",Other White Wines
"Another stunner in the Champagne Direct Import quiver here at K&L. This blend of 60% Chardonnay/40% Pinot Noir shows the best of both varietals. The zip and freshness of the Chard shows beautiful crisp apples and some lovely and delicate floral notes while the Pinot Noir adds red fruited notes of cranberry and wild cherries. The really remarkable this about this bottle though is that it has been aged for 5 years on the lees - under a cork. This adds richness, a slightly nutty oxidative note, and typically a substantial amount to the price (compare to the also fabulous cork aged bottle of 2005 Bollinger ""Grande Année"" Brut Champagne for $100). At way less than half of that price this is a magnificent bottle with a unique story to tell.

"Sometimes it is impossible to separate an outstanding wine from an outstanding setting! I recently enjoyed this champagne in Point Reyes, under a huge umbrella in the pouring rain.

"This past week we ordered some paddlefish caviar from Kelly’s Katch in Tennessee. Clyde had recommended Kelly’s years ago to us, and we have enjoyed their stuff immensely. We treated ourselves to a two ounce can and paired it with this great bottle, which worked out very well indeed. I prepared some buckwheat blini in our trusty skillet and brought home a small container of crème fraiche to complete the caviar kit. This Champagne comes from Bethon, in the middle of the Sezanne department, a chalk outcrop about 30 miles south of Epernay. It is aged for five years on the lees on a cork rather than a cap, so the cork we pulled out before serving it was the 2nd that had been in the bottle. Ageing on a cork like this is a pain- none of the disgorgement lines will accommodate bottles like this, and they must all be disgorged by hand. The benefit is a better exchange with, and a bit of immunization from oxygen.The five years on the lees gave this wine a nutty creaminess that mirrored the caviar, while the pure chalk soil gave the wine the zip and minerality needed to cut the richness. It was a great way to spend a Monday night!

"This new direct buy is filled with delicate high tones of floral on the nose and an abundance of upfront pear and peach on the palate.  Just found my new BBQ bubble bottle.

"A delightful Prosecco  from Italy which is dry but still very soft and elegant on the palate. Perfect Party bubbles for the Holiday season!
",Other White Wines
"Exactly what I look for in a Prosecco, crisp, refreshing and fruity without being sweet and cloying. Greg did a wonderful job finding this producer to bring in directly, stone and core fruits jump out of the glass, continuing on the palate with a lovely clean mouth feel. A bright lovely drink that is the perfect start of an evening.

"A vintage Champagne for $29.99, from a highly lauded vintage no less?!  Yes, you read that right.  This wine is drinking excellently now but is also a bottle you could lay down for years to come.  It's showing some delicious toasty, creamy qualities on the palate while maintaining mouth-watering acidity and freshness.  It has an almost creme fraiche like note on the nose along with freshly pressed apple juice, caramel covered almonds, and butterscotch cheesecake.  Just a spectacular showing and a bottle I'd like to see evolve over time.  And while I'm waiting, I'll just have to grab a couple of bottles to drink in the meantime.
",Other White Wines
"This is a very special bottle of vintage Champagne. For many years now, the Baron Fuente Millesime has been one of the greatest values in the entire category. The 2008 is certainly the very best vintage we have had from them.. Even better than the great 1996! Like past vintages, this has great richness and toast from a nice long rest on the lees, and fine power from their great estate vineyards. The great 2008 vintage has added an electric length and profound minerality to this wine that is rare in Champagne at any price, and almost unheard of at this price! Take a case... You won't regret it!
",Other White Wines
"I have been lucky enough to try the few 2008 vintage Champagnes we have in the store, and all have impressed me with their exceptional quality and their ability to cellar. The 40% of Pinot Meunier also makes me love this bottle! I always find PM adds elegant aromatics and suppleness to champagnes which molds well into the high acid of the 2008 vintage. A small bit of Pinot Noir adds extra body and texture while the majority of Chardonnay brings those fresh green apple and citrus notes. The mid palate is long and lean while the black fruit adds weight and texture to the side palate. Elegant and impressive.
",Other White Wines
"This Champagne offers richly concentrated flavor and power, with aromas of toasted hazlenut, dried golden apple and sultanas. The palate is bright and dry, with lively flavors of meyer lemon and chalky mineral, but the real surprise is in the luscious finish! Suddenly cocoa and baking spices take the forefront. It is thrilling to become acquainted with the Grand Millesime, and even more thrilling under thirty dollars.
",Other White Wines
"I am so happy vintage Baron Fuente is back!!! Seriously these wines are insane, vintage champagne for under $30 and not just any vintage, but the great 2008 vintage! Baron Fuente does a lot with Meunier, and although this blend is only 40% Meunier and 45% Chardonnay and the rest Pinot Noir. there is the classic rich nutty notes that I love in these wines. Floral, almond, and vanilla are all at play here with the high acid one would expect from this vintage to play against the richness of the fruit. A wonderful finish helps to draw this delightful wine to a close and ensures me that this will be a wine to buy more than one of because I may go through it fairly quickly.
",Other White Wines
"Yet another direct import 2008 vintage Champagne for a laughably low price, the Baron Fuente is not only from a great vintage, but also consists of 100% estate grown fruit (for added context, you are likely to pay at least 2.5x as much for a larger grande marque's vintage wine, consisting of large amounts of purchased fruit). Big, bright, golden fruit along with brioche/challah dough nuances combine for a delicious Champagne that should please lots of folks for drinking now, though with a recent disgorgement and at just 9 years young, it should drink well for quite some time.
",Other White Wines
"Vintage Champagne can be difficult to come across as it accounts for less than 5% of production, so when you find a vintage bottling this delicious, that makes it all the more special. K&L Champagne buyer Gary Westby introduced me to Baron Fuente and it was a light bulb moment in how complex and interesting vintage Champagnes can be. This bottling is a unique blend of estate fruit (which is rare for a house this size) made of 45% Chardonnay, 40% Pinot Meunier, and 15% Pinot Noir. This is a delicious balance and a great value for a vintage Champagne.
",Other White Wines
"It's not easy to purchase a bottle of vintage Champagne for anywhere near this price! Baron Fuente, a small producer we've been highly focused on for many years, has offered up some of the best values in Champagne-dom. Lots of intensity on the nose, full of baking spice and apple skins. Lovely intensity and  wonderfully creamy on the palate. Although it's dry it has a round, medium weight body and presence that is not typical for Brut. The finish has hints of fresh spiced mango. What a tremendous value!
",Other White Wines
"I probably don't have to tell you that the '08 vintage is one of the best lately, and I think my favorite for this Champagne ever.  It shows a lovely nutty and leesy nose and a rich stone fruit palate - lovely balance and a fantastic wet stone note.  Full and rich and balanced with a fantastic crisp finish, it's a credit to its vintage!
",Other White Wines
"Baron Fuente’s latest vintage release is causing excitement among K&L staffers!  It displays the opulent rich ripeness afforded by the warm, dry finish to the growing season, but with a vibrant freshness that animates the wine!  Mineral driven with lively citrus and stone fruit flavors, it has classic Champagne balance and structure that I plan on revisiting as many times as possible given its remarkably low price-point! 
",Other White Wines
"I just tasted a sample bottle of this last night (9/8/2016) and it is magnificent! It is clean and crisp with a long finish and a core of apples, cream and notes. Lemon meringue and nectarine on the finish. This is a SUPER bargain, so don't miss it. One of the BEST vintages since 1996. It is on its way folks, so please be patient! One of the benefits of tasting a preview bottle. It will sell out quickly!
",Other White Wines
"Another stupendous value from the magicians at Baron Fuente, this magically little bottle should embarrass most grand marque producers releasing lesser wine for 2 or 3 times the price. The nose has fresh nuts, strong stone fruit and yellow flowers (honeysuckles!). The palate shows exceptional balance with extreme focus revolving around citrus and stone fruits again, but with a freshness that can't go unnoticed. Supremely drinkable, but still taught hinting at wonderful potential in the cellar. Early proof that 2008 was truly the special vintage that was promised.
",Other White Wines
"This little beauty has a base wine that is at least three years old and vintage reserve stock that is generally 8-10 years old. It has a creamy nose of ripe, yellow fruits and lemon meringue. Initially, rich on the palate, with golden apple, honeycomb and nectarine flavors. A nice, lingering finish that is clean and oak free. It spends 48 months on the lees and is composed of 1/3 each of the three primary Champagne varietals. Just lovely!
",Other White Wines
"An exceptional, value-priced offering from a house with clout, “White Foil” is subtly smoky and weightlessly creamy, with rich apple fruit balanced by enough acid to maintain focus through to the snappy but long finish. Pol Roger is the Champagne of royalty, and the care that goes into this cuvée is apparent. Aged 48 months on the lees and based on key spectacular vintages, this shows hints of toastiness, despite seeing no oak, and – like all Pol Roger releases – is still hand-riddled. This is one of our most requested Champagnes in Hollywood, and for good reason.
",Other White Wines
"Pol Roger, long the favorite Champagne House of the Royal Family of Great Britain, takes special steps towards exceptional quality in their Brut Reserve.  The nonvintage cuvée is an equal blend of the three allowed varieties, which are double cold-settled and slow fermented in the particularly cold cellar (9°C) entirely in stainless steel.  The result is incredibly pure fruit flavors of lemon citrus, apples and stone fruit with a generous, creamy texture from the 9g/L dosage and extended lees aging, during which each bottle is hand-riddled.   Considering the process, this is and always has been a great value in bubbles. 
",Other White Wines
"A classic for a reason. The cellars of Pol Roger are the deepest and coldest in Epernay, reaching over 110 feet into the chalk, and here every bottle is still hand riddled. This toasty, well balanced grand marque is composed of about 1/3 each Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Meunier. It is treated to four years of ageing on the lees and has 25% reserve wines in the blend. It makes a lovely aperitif, and is supremely well balanced. If you haven't had this lately, it is a must try!
",Other White Wines
"One of my new favorite finds at K&L! This is a gorgeous Champagne. Lots of focus and elegance showing from start to finish. Just slightly toasty, this Brut is full of integrated acid and fresh minerality that will have your taste buds tingling and salivating for more! An amazing value for under $40 as well! Stock up for the holidays before its gone!

"To those who like to dismiss Prosecco as inconsequential, light, bubbly and sweet, I would say, you obviously have yet to taste Silvano Follador's Prosecco Superiore Brut Nature. This is serious sparkling wine of the highest quality. Not sweet but bone dry, bracing and crisp in style. The ultimate aperitif, and the perfect beginning to a night of cooking and eating great Italian food and drinking Italian wine.
",Other White Wines
"One of the best Proseccos that I have the pleasure of tasting. It benefits from the fact that it is vinified Brut as opposed to Extra Dry, which lends itself to allowing for the purity of fruit to express itself rather than playing second fiddle to the residual sweetness. This wine evokes freshness: green apple, grapefruit zest, and melon on the nose. Alpine wildflowers as well, quite subtly. On the palate, the wine is dry and crisp, with both white orchard and stone fruit coming through. On the finish, citrus flavors play with a toastiness that is reminiscent of brioche almost. One of the most layered and satisfying Proseccos I’ve tasted in a long time; a great choice as an aperitif
",Other White Wines
"During our visit to this winery in 2016, Alberta Follador mentioned that her brother Silvano was a perfectionist. This was hardly a surprise to me as Follador is the finest Prosecco I've come across. While most of the Prosecco hitting the market is made in an Extra Dry (slightly sweet) style, Follador is a Brut (dry) which makes it not only somewhat unique but also in a class all its own. It really is that good.
",Other White Wines
"It's back!!! This is a perfect wine for this time of year. This Prosecco has been one of K&L’s best sellers since we started bringing it in many years ago.  There is melon and green apple, and it is crisp and floral on the palate. A long finish and a subtle mousse make this delicious wine a sure bet for your table. This wine will work well as an alternative to Champagne. Fun bubbles and great value for the last days of summer.
",Other White Wines
"The brother-and-sister team of Silvano and Alberta Follador make the best Prosecco I have ever tasted! Biodynamic, their Prosecco is magnificently balanced, delicate and features sophisticated fruit aromatics. It is a blend of the famed Cartizze vineyard and another close by in Valdobbiadene. This wine doesn’t feel like “regular” Prosecco it feels more like a Franciacorta it has that much power but without the size. It has a mineral driven feel, flinty, focused and rich, it has a bit of brioche like flavors that add to the complexity. The Best Prosecco made, without a doubt!
",Other White Wines
"Krug never fails to impress, and the racy 164 Ème release – based on the cooler, dazzling 2008 vintage – is destined for greatness, although right now is just a baby. Upon first sip, it lacks the rounded, easy accessibility of the 163rd, instead presenting sharp minerality that showcases the special chalky soil of Krug’s vineyard sites. This is a bottle to cellar, and I have no doubt will reward you with the classic Krug brioche, pear fruit and almond complexity after a few more years of age. Drink the 163 Ème for your next celebration, and save this gorgeous 164th edition for the future.
",Other White Wines
"What a treat it is to work in the wine industry and taste new bottles of Krug on a random Thursday. After tasting at work where it showed crisp, clean flavors of crunchy red apples and fresh minerality, I was lucky enough to take the bottle home where it continued to reveal all the depth and complexity expected of this legendary producer (and then some). With some air time, this wine offers ripe pears and white peaches, honeyed almonds, toasted brioche, subtly funky beeswax, and a pretty floral tone giving the impression of lithe elegance for such a full-bodied, voluptuous Champagne.
",Other White Wines
"The 164th edition of Krug is only the second comercial release with the edition on the front label- and what an addition it is! Based on the fantastic 2008 vintage, this spectacular Champagne is composed of 11 different vintages going all the way back to 1990. While the 163rd edition drinks better today, this great bottle of Champagne will eclipse nearly anything that a collector could buy at this price after a few years in a good cellar. Not only does this have the breadth and depth of power that we all love in Krug, it has the chalky electric energy of the 2008 vintage. This is already becoming a legend in its own time... But in a few years, look out!
",Other White Wines
"Krug Grand Cuvee has long been a go-to for me when it comes to a luxury Champagne. It has the magic combination of brand recognition (aka ""bling factor"") but also consistently maintains exceptional quality (something that can't be said for some of it's peers).  Krug is the benchmark for richer styles of Champagne. It has a crowd pleasing nutty, toasty character but also a beautiful acid line and lingering minerality. This house is also undoubtedly THE master of blending. They have a staggering amount of reserve wines from different villages, single parcels and past vintages. You might think that the mastery of this blending technique would be kept close to the chest as a proprietary secret...and yet the opposite is true! Krug has embraced full transparency when it comes to what components make up their Grand Cuvee placing an ID number on each and every bottle that details its composition. They have now started noting what ""Edition"" the wine comes from front and center on the label. My take is that when you do everything with the true diligence and commitment to detail that Krug does then I guess you don't have anything to hide! Finally (talk about burying the lead...) this 164th Edition of the Grand Cuvee is largely based on 2008 with reserve wines back to 1990! The focus, tension and linear nature of the legendary 2008 vintage is clear to see in this bottling. This is a seriously good and very distinctive bottling of Grand Cuvee and I believe one that will continue to improve for years (if not decades) in the cellar.
",Other White Wines
"While this wine is based on 2008, the oldest of the 11 vintage blend is 1990- my birth year, so I find this wine lucky from the start! 8+ years on the lees and almost half Pinot Noir, the Grand Cuvee 164 has undeniable earth undertones intermingling with a mix of tart lemon zest and sweet meyer lemon.Angular but complex, allowing this wine come into its own will be rewarding for all.
",Other White Wines
"Not at all a surprise, this edition of the Grande Cuvée based on the now legendary 2008 vintage is stunning.  Saffron, pears and brioche, thrilling acidity and precision rarely seen in lesser champagnes make this a must-buy for collectors and connoisseurs.
",Other White Wines
"The vineyard for the Classic bottling is made from a vineyard that is 50% 30 year old vines and 50% 10 year old vines. The nose is full of elderflower, pear and stone fruit aromatics, but the really impressive part of this wine is the palate presence, body, texture, and depth add to the mineral laden center of the wine. The finish is decisive, focused and seems to go on forever.
",Other White Wines
"This 2015 Verdicchio di Matelica, is a very good example for the vintage. Offers apple and refreshing citric fruit flavors, and aromas with the characteristic touch of green herbs, is a wonderful value, a well-rounded wine, beautifully structured, soft on the palate but with a slight suggestion of almond (typical for Verdicchio), a great summer sipping wine and is very food-friendly.
",Other White Wines
"The color of this wine always stops me in my tracks. The concentrated gold color comes from the extra time on the vines, not oak. It starts with rich aromatics of fresh citrus and spice that leads into a full bodied, elongated and balanced wine. It has the elegance of an oaked wine with fresh, mineral driven fineness.
",Other White Wines
"2015 was an exceptionally good vintage for white wine in Italy and we're reminded of this every time we taste this outstanding Verdicchio from our friends at La Monacesca. This richly endowed white combines scents of saline, dried honey, citrus and mineral with a creamy texture and mouthwatering acidity. Ideal with fish, poultry, lighter pastas and risotto.
",Other White Wines
"An electric rosé! Composed of 50% Pinot Noir and 50% Meunier, this expensively-made wine goes through carbonic maceration and the saignée method, with a little still red wine added in. The result is stunning: gorgeous wild berry fruit with delicate bead, bracing acidity and a clean, minerally finish.
",Other White Wines
"A perennial favorite, the rose does not disappoint on this go-round.  Pretty raspberry and black cherry notes highlight the freshness and richness of the wine.  Unbelievable quality at the price.
",Other White Wines
"Just astonishing how delicious this is for the price. It hits every note you want from a rose champagne, both power and elegance, round and rich with great long structure, aromatic pinot fruit with a hint of savory spice. You could decant it and serve it with a filet mignon as easily as you'd serve it with your aper'eau. A triumph of wine making fit for the most frugal lover of bubbles and the most opulent spender alike.
",Other White Wines
"We have been working with Aspasie for years, as they were our first direct import Champagne producer. Their wine continues to be of the highest quality, making it the best value Champagne in the store. Year after year, the rosé is my favorite rosé in the store. With flavors of black cherry, ripe cranberry, rosemary and an earthier backbone, this rose is beautiful both as an aperitif and especially fantastic with food. Try it with a roast duck or heavier fish like salmon or tuna steak.
",Other White Wines
"Rose. It is possibly one of the most singularly used words in the lexicon of wine, and yet, it is so often mischaracterized. People think it's sweet. People think it is light. Well, listen up, folks, because PEOPLE ARE WRONG! This is clearly evidenced here with Ariston Aspasie's beautifully crafted Brut Rose. Neither sweet, nor particularly, light, what it absolutely is is REFRESHING! Given a supremely unique personality from the method of taking its color from completely vinified red wine as opposed to the more common method of including a degree of skin contact, this is one of the drier rose champagnes I've tasted lately. Cranberry, dried-cherry, and a hint of spice-box all work together to create a medley of wonderment that you won't soon forget!
",Other White Wines
"There is not another bottle of pink Champagne that offers this value in the store, end of story. This perfectly crafted bottle of bubbles is sensational wine, and at a price that I can afford to drink more than just on special occasions. A pretty coral pink greets you in the glass, alongside a nose of vibrant cherry, sweetened dried cranberry, and anise spice. Elegant red fruits burst on the scene out of the glass, kissing your palate with lifted notes of rose petal and wild cherry. So good!
",Other White Wines
"Nobody in Champagne works harder on making a great rose than Paul-Vincent Ariston, owner of Champagne Aspasie, and no bottle that we carry is as outstanding of a bargain. Most producers either make a red wine to blend into their white or do a maceration of all the skins for a short time to make rose. Paul does both, as he likes the complexity that the maceration method brings to the wine, and the control that the addition of red wine offers. This isn't just a good deal, it is a Champagne of spectacular depth and character, that is also super easy to drink.
",Other White Wines
"Lovely rose champagne from one of our favorite producers! With a pale coral color, this is a light bodied rose with hints of wild strawberry, vanilla, clove, and a gorgeous, creamy texture. Certainly one of my top rose champagne picks!

"Minerally, cranberry and tart- the perfect pairing with smoked salmon appetizers. The richness of the salmon would be outstanding with the crisp mineral zip of this fantastic rose.

"The Ariston Aspasie rosé ($32.99) is such a richly impressive, full-bodied rosé made up of 50% pinot noir and 50% pinot meunier.  12% vinified still red pinot meunier is added to give this rosé its beautiful salmon color.  What makes this rosé stand out amongst the crowd of trendy charlatans is the 5 years it is aged on its lees.  The complexity, the richness, the layers of berry fruit balanced by vibrant acidity and lazy bubbles is matched by only a few lone standouts in a rosé world full of so many imposters.
",Other White Wines
"This wine is always our answer to the Billecart Salmon, which by the way sells for more than twice as much. This is all about the red Ariston fruit and their champagnes are permanent staff picks. Cherry notes from the pinot noir, crisp and vibrant acidity and brioche flavors swirl together with delicate bubbles. Anyone care for some?
",Other White Wines
"It blows my mind. $32.99, really? Small production grower rose champagne, aged on the lees for 5 years?? Are you sure, only $32.99? Beautiful to behold with its tawny pink color - and a joy to consume with layers of flavor and aroma. Enjoy alongside baked ham, herbed quiche - or even smoked almonds as an afternoon treat!

"Fresh off de boat! Just tried this last Saturday night (4th of July). Those of you who are fans, don't be confused by the new Aspasie label! It's the same wine you have loved for years!

We always sell out of this one!

"Ruinart’s flagship wine is built in a style that emphasizes a very crisp, clean, and elegant Champagne experience.  Made in a reductive style so that the high quality Premier Cru juice sees very little oxygen during vinification, the clean flavors of citrus and stone fruits dominate against a backdrop of pronounced minerality and crisp acid.  If your looking to impress company, no matter how discerning the palates, pick this up.
",Other White Wines
"Broad and decadent the Blanc des Blancs from Ruinart is chock full of summer ripe peaches and poached pears. Floral and opulent nose, white flowers and gala apple float out of the glass. Continuing with gingersnaps and Crème brûlée, on the palate that is weighty and lush. This wine finishes with a vein of chalk and honey crisp apple to complete the picture on a lovely bottle of bubbles.
",Other White Wines
"The Ruinart Brut Blanc De Blancs is a wonderfully different style of Chardonnay based Champagne than any other that we have. While almost all of the others that we carry rely on the laser precision of Cote de Blanc fruit exclusively, this wine balances this electricity with the rich, nearly grapey Chardonnay of the Mountain of Reims. The result is magic; a full bodied blanc de blancs that still finishes dry and long!These crus; Trepail and Villers Marmery on the Mountain of Reims round out the mineraly focus of the Cotes de Blancs fruit. This is a creamy, subtly toasty bottle of Champagne with a little bit of lychee exoticism. It has class to spare and is exceptionally easy to drink.
",Other White Wines
"All Grand Cru fruit in this delicious blanc de blanc. An excellent combination of yeastiness,stone fruits and citrus fruits. Classic finish laden with crisp minerality. Dosage of 8g.

"Le Battistelle’s Soave Classico “Montesei” shows you the classic signature for volcanic wines; they never seem to leave your palate, they seem to deposit themselves on your tongue! The nose is full of sweet, white peach aromatics but once this wine hits your palate it explodes. That peach aromatic turns to plump sweetness on your tongue and then it is pierced by a bolt of volcanic mineral, that mineral just doesn’t go away, it doesn’t linger it dominates the sensation in your mouth for the next minute. While starting out as a supple, elegant wine the Montesei turns volcanic in your mouth. Tremendous finish and character for a wine at this price point! 12.5% ABV
",Other White Wines
"The ""Montesei"" is a real treat at such a nominal price! It begins with aromas of green apple skin and Crenshaw melon and reveals a bit of dried honey and florals as it opens. The palate is even richer with a creamy texture and a core of acidity that provides lift and length. There's a lot going on here at the price, so give this some time to open up.
",Other White Wines
"Part of what I love about about working in the wine industry is changing people's preconceived notions about wine; what it should be, what it should taste like, and most importantly, what a good bottle should cost.  I can shout it from the rooftops!  A good bottle of Champagne does not have to cost over $60!  Sure, there are fantastic bottles at that price point (and higher), but if I can find Champagne that I can afford to drink on a regular basis, I'm all about it.  This is one such bottle.  It's got a rich apple-y nose with a yeasty baguette note and fresh lemon to boot.  The palate mirrors the nose and feels vibrant yet rich at the same time with a great balance of texture and acidity.  If you love Champagne, this is one to pick up on your next visit.

"Bright with golden apple and leaner citrus fruit, plus more lift here than the easygoing 2009, 2010 Louise Brison Brut Champagne feels aligned with the crisp 2008, pairing vivid acid with accessibility. This showed beautifully at our Champagne Tent Event, where we were charmed by the story of the family’s matriarch and brand namesake, and impressed by the quality of this DI release. This is bargain-priced Champagne, and in stock just in time for a season full of celebrations – cheers!
",Other White Wines
"Year to year the Louise Brison vintage Brut is one of the best deals in the store! The family takes no short cuts in production- all estate grapes, barrel fermented and aged, and giving the wine a few months to rest after disgorgement. It is the perfect recipe for a textured, complex champagne filled to the brim with notes of ripe apples, gentle spice and fresh acidity that keeps it long on the finish.
",Other White Wines
"One of the first grower-producers I ever tasted, Louise Brison’s vintage Champagnes hold a special place in my heart.  The 2010 continues the legacy of vintage greatness with vibrant pear, lemon and toasted brioche flavors alongside a stellar acidity for length and structure. 
",Other White Wines
"The vintage wines from Louise Brison are an incredible deal in fine wine. Delphine Brulez is one of the few grower-producers that we work with to have a diploma in oenology, and she works her vines in Noe-les-Mallets organically before fermenting her juice entirely in small oak barrels. The results in 2010 are electric and refreshing, but still round enough to have alone as the aperitif. This blend of half each Chardonnay and Pinot Noir will fool even the most discerning connoisseur for Champagne that costs no less than 50% more. We recently had a bottle of the 1992, and I am here to tell you that if you can keep your hands off of it, it will age very well too! If you like your Champagne clean, refreshing, dry and long, this is one to load up on.
",Other White Wines
"Right away my curiousity was peeked while sticking my nose into the glass. Distinctive floral and mineral characteristics develop into a long lasting, toasty finish with bright fruit and acidity. A steal of a deal at this price point!
",Other White Wines
"Vintage Champagne for under $30 is an anomaly to be sure. Thanks to our DI Champagne program, though, we have a Champagne here that is not only vintage dated and carefully aged (for a good bit longer than the AOC dictated minimums) but also stylish and much more expensive/serious tasting than the price would suggest. There are two very good reasons for this: very expensive Chardonnay from Kimmeridgian soils and barrel ageing. I love Louise Brison's vintage Champagnes not only for their fair pricing, but also the inherent quality, craft and style in each one that I've had. These are always incredibly popular Champagnes here - don't miss out on the 2010!
",Other White Wines
"If you liked the 2009 Louise Brison, you'll probably enjoy the 2010 as well, albeit for completely different reasons. 2009 was a ripe vintage for Champagne and that richness of fruit came through immediately in the Brison expression, but 2010 was back to traditional temperature levels so the 2010 has a laser beam of acidity that was definitely not there in the 2009 and for me that was a welcome addition. What is consistent between the wines is the brown apple flavors and the texture from the barrel fermentation that adds weight. However, whereas I would have recommended drinking the 2009's immediately, the 10's can age forever. That note of citrus and minerality is a total palate cleanser if you choose to drink the 2010 as an aperitif wine now, but it's also what will help the wine maintain its composure as it continues to evolve in your cellar. It's a can't lose proposition: you can drink it tomorrow, or twenty years from now! And you get a wine of that quality for just under thirty bucks. Hard to beat, right?
",Other White Wines
"This is one of our best Champagne deals at K&L! For right under $30, you get all 2010 fruit that was vinified and aged in French oak barrels and has a perfect balance of toast and freshness. On the forefront there are floral, yellow apple and citrus notes followed by bright acidity and minerality. This is a fantastic bottle of bubbly to enjoy before dinner with appetizers!
",Other White Wines
"All of the elements you would expect in a complex and pricey bottle of Champagne come in this wine at a truly unbelievable price. A vintage Champagne that is fully aged in oak barrels from such a well-respected producer almost always costs twice this much. This vintage of Brison is made by a phenomenal female winemaker, Delphine Brulez, with an extensive background in both the science and art of great Champagne making and it really is a labor of love for her. A wonderful balance of soft fruit and richness without being heavy, this wine is drinking fantastically now. The Pinot Noir adds a great depth and the Chardonnay keeps it bright and energetic. A great choice for the hot days of Summer, but will also lead you right through the Fall.

"One of the best priced Grand Marque Champagnes we have on the shelf, especially when taking account the quality of the wine. More than one third of the wine is barrel fermented and more than one third is reserve wine aged for a minimum of 10 years in magnums before blending creating possibly one of the most complex champagnes I have tasted yet. Some cracker or fresh brioche aromas mixed with fresh yellow apples draw you into a textured yet lively palate that doesn't stand still!

"The Bollinger Special Cuvee is a Champagne for the connoisseur, as it is created painstakingly from up to forty percent reserve wines, which are stored in Magnums, under half pressure, and hand disgorged before bottling! This is a Champagne of exceptional quality and small production, created from grapes grown on Chalky, south facing soil. Aromas of lightly toasted nuts lead to a broad, very dry palate, with a dominant, chalky minerality and a slightly creamy roundness.

"This family owned and independent House still makes one of the best and most reliable oak aged Champagnes on the market.  3 to 4 years ageing on the lees has filled this with notes of caramel, toast, ripe apricot and touches of oak in a bold and chalky style.  This is big, full bodied bubbly that is filled with richness and tension.
",Other White Wines
"Bollinger is one of my immediate go to houses for people looking for a known name that delivers stunning wine for the price. The special cuvee from them is the perfect place to start with this all family owned estate. Lovely fruit notes of early plum, red fruit, and green apple with a little wood and spice are all firmly in balance here. The level of complexity is impressive and the finish is soft but does not fall flat in any way. There is also a beautiful tartness to the wine from the acid that serves to enhance the overall experience.
",Other White Wines
"Oh man, is this good, soooo good! We have to be careful around here about picking favorites in the Champagne category, because the fact is that we all love Champagne and our current favorite may be bested by yet another delicious bottling before long. That said, for many of us, Bollinger is a long-time favorite amongst the grande marques, a true original and - without going into detail - a process that is ridiculously labor intensive, manual and expensive even for their Special Cuvee.  With aromas of loquat, and a slightly savory, Beurre Blanc like note, the current bottling immediately drew me in in. It may be the 1/3 barrel fermented aspect of the base wine, the presence of 10-20 year old reserve wine, or my experience with the other great chalky soil based wine region of Europe, but I detected just a passing resemblance to Manzanilla here! A bright, delicious, complete and complex palate seals the deal and Bollinger continues to be one of my absolute faves.
",Other White Wines
"I find this to be one of the most interesting Champagnes we have on the shelves right now because of how many different notes and tastes it possesses. While Bollinger is one of the larger houses in Champagne, they are absolutely one of the best. The amount of care and work they put into their Champagne is unreal and the dedication to quality is beyond almost all others. The average age of the wine in this bottle is ten years old and one third of it is barrel fermented, which is far less common in Champagne. Topping wine in this house is kept in magnum bottles, separated by cru and vintage, which means they have to pop every single one when it comes time to add dosage to the bottles. This painstaking work results in an unbelievable  wine and one I would be happy to have anytime.
",Other White Wines
"This Champagne is crazy good! Crazy because its primary fermentation is 1/2 done in barrel and crazy because the 1/2 of the wine is aged in magnum at 1/2 pressure (3 fathoms) and then disgorged and blended in. Two hundred and fifty-thousand magnums hand-disgorged and tested for cork taint as the mags are aged on the cork, not crown cap. Who does this?! The Special Cuvée is bright and lively on the initial taste but, fleshes out and the trademark Bollinger golden fruits and caramel come into play. Super, super long finish! Still a family-owned Champagne house!
",Other White Wines
"You don't get this fine of a wine without putting in a lot of effort! If I had to give a gift and it needed name recognition, and it had to be epic, and it had to be less than 100 dollars - This is it!! Intense, spicy musk, with a serious presence. Lots of weight  and complexity to explore. Great minerality and plenty of apple flavors to enjoy. A perfect bottle of bubbly!

"Who doesn't love Bolli! 007, The gals from Ab Fab, and us!  Seriously this has always been a favorite, likely due to its generous use of reserve wines and meticulous winemaking, the bold rich and nutty presence and light zesty lemon peel highlights are truly hard to resist.
",Other White Wines
"Beyond the fact that this is 007 prefered glass of fizz...I must admit I love Bollinger. It is unashamedly a rich style, barrel fermented, round, toasty, packed full of Pinot Noirs red fruited richness. The wine contains 40% older reserve wines and it shows in the wines depth and persistence on the palate. 3-4 years on the lees gives a lovely autolytic presence to the wine along with a lick of oak barrel spice that lingers long in the finish. I can see why Mr. Bond is partial to this...it's powerful and sophisticated.

"Do I really have to encourage you to buy this? Wow... one of the few barrel fermented Champagnes left. So good, focus, texture, etc., etc. Damn, that's good.

"Bollinger has a sterling reputation in Champagne for stalwart quality for a great reason. They do the hard work to make great Champagne, and there Special Cuvee is the standard barer for their range. Along with Krug, Bollinger is the only grand marque to refuse to give up their barrels, which they still ferment the wine in to this day. They are located in the village of Ay, famous for being the chalkiest terroir for Pinot Noir in all of Champagne, and Ay is the soul of this blend. It is one of the fullest, most powerful non-vintages from the grand marques, and also one of the driest. If you are a fan of Champagne and haven't tried this classic, you should!
",Other White Wines
"A pinot noir-dominated blend that immediately after opening, has a distinctive leesy, slightly oxidated nose.  This is no doubt from the reserve wines that are fermented in oak barrel and then aged in magnums under low pressure.  This also lends to the full-bodied, richness of the wine.  After several minutes of aeration, the sweet smell of ripe, sun-soaked apples begin to emerge.  The predominance of estate fruit (approximately 70% of the assemblage) lends to the broad, rich and intense flavors.  Fresh and toasty on the palate with a slight touch of hazelnut, the Special Cuvee has a long finish with a hint of exotic spice at the very end.

"A great, crisp, clean prosecco. Bone dry with very clean, light aroma of lemon rind  rounded out by a touch of creaminess.  Perfect for that everyday occasion that can always be enhanced by some bubbles.

"Valdobbiadene is the heart of Prosecco for me, perhaps not geographically but certainly stylistically. Here the wines have more soul; they vineyards are extraordinary, splattered over a maze of steeply sloping hills, not one big mass but a conglomeration of hundreds of small growers. It is here that the Bronca Sisters (Sorelle Bronca) make their Extra Dry Prosecco DOCG, theirs is an excellent expression of soil, sun and fruit, superb balance and incredibly refreshing, the hallmarks of great Prosecco.

"I consider the 2008 Fallet Dart to be the most exciting vintage Champagne that we have in stock. It comes from estate vineyards in the far west of Champagne, in the tiny hamlet of Drachy, from a family that has been growing grapes for an astounding 17 generations. This bottling is composed of 70% Chardonnay and 30% Pinot Noir, and most of the Chardonnay comes from one of the few ""clos"" sites in Champagne, the Clos du Mont. This vineyard was the first monastic site in the region and perhaps the oldest of the ""clos"" in Champagne, first planted around the same time as the l'eglise Drachy was built: 741! The wine has the electricity, length and mineral drive that one would expect from the great 2008 vintage. The surprise is how much body and structure comes along with the minerality, and the complex, seemingly every changing flavors of the wine. I found it to have everything from sourdough to truffles to nectarines from one sip to the next. We tasted this next to the 1999, a much softer vintage that is still going strong... This is a bottle for the ages- if you can keep your hands off of it!
",Other White Wines
"The 2008 Fallet Dart Brut Champagne is a fine example of a vintage Champagne from an incredible year. Chardonnay driven and with a fine mousse, this wine has a slightly higher acidity than some, which gives it great aging potential, and offers a refreshing note of bright green apple. There are creamy undertones as well, offered by the Chardonnay and extended lees contact, with aromas and flavors of almond meringue. The wine is very clean and offers an intense chalky minerality. This is truly a beauty.
",Other White Wines
"Is there such a thing as too much great 2008 vintage Champagne? Of course not!   We have sold some great value bottles from this legend in the making vintage: Franck Bonville Millesime, Louise Brisson, Launois,  Louis Brochet, amongst others. Delicious as those are, for fans of subtlety and balanced lees driven complexity, the 2008 Fallet Dart is your wines. Biscuity and yellow fruited aromas (70% Chard in this cuvee) lead to a palate that balances rich yet balanced autolytic qualities with loads of acid driven intensity. It's very fine now, and will only get better with age. This is a top value in the store right now, and needless to say for a wine of this quality, that will age with grace for years, from a top quality vintage...it's a steal. My highest possible recommendation for this beautiful wine.
",Other White Wines
"This probably my favorite of all of the Fallet-Dart Champagnes that we have been stocking. A more Chardonnay-driven release, this formidable 2008 is dry but, retains the houses' overall rich style. Minerals, green apple and a hint of anise on the nose. On the palate, hints of golden apple, cream and caramel with lively acidity and elegant balance. A 2008 vintage at this price and quality is like seeing a winged unicorn!
",Other White Wines
"Of course the 2008 vintage has given us great Champagnes, and it's no exception with Fallet-Dart.  Their '08 vintage has a fantastic deep brioche like character with zesty citrus and white grape fruits sparkling over rich baked apple.  The 70% Chardonnay really shines through and the long persistent finish shows a wonderful mineral component.  All you would expect from this great vintage at a price that is amazingly affordable
",Other White Wines
"Spectacular champagne from a spectacular vintage, always a good combination. The fact that the Fallet Dart House has been around since the 17th century means that they have learned a few things about making champagne, fortunately for us we can directly import them and offer just a little ridiculous pricing. A creamier nose with the toasty character of Fallet Dart leads to a body showcasing both the ripeness and acid of this vintage. Hints of vanilla from the barrel aging add layers of complexity and the finish is truly magnificent.
",Other White Wines
"Beautifully unique flavor profile sure to put a smile on everyone's face. The nose boasts age with a brooding, yet not overwhelming toast and marmalade complexion that instantly pulls you in. The palate is similar in that the nuances seem unending, but in a lean and structured order. Love this.
",Other White Wines
"Vivid and enticing immediately upon opening, this is a connoisseur’s Champagne that is still super accessible. Gorgeously floral on the nose, hits of honeysuckle and white flowers give way to tart green apple and lusher pear fruit and a subtly creamy mouthfeel. The acid is apparent but not overpowering: just enough to showcase the colder 2008 vintage’s more bracing minerality. Fallet-Dart is always a budget-friendly option, but this vintage Direct Import is an especially complex, sophisticated offering at an astounding price... I can already tell I'll be turning to this powerhouse all summer.
",Other White Wines
"Such an intriguing Champagne! Spiced pear, lemon zest, flaky pie crust, mineral, dried apple, saline...and while not exactly the same, it reminds me a lot of the Krug Grand Cuvee. As it warmed in my glass, it became more weighty and lingered on the palate. I enjoyed this with my favorite shrimp tempura rolls from my local sushi spot. The toastiness of the tempura complemented the wine perfectly! The fabulous 2008 vintage is just beginning to shine here- I can't wait to see how this develops. A true worthy addition to my regular weekly Champagne ration (because yes, I have one), and most definitely worthy of  my cellar!
",Other White Wines
"We've got another awesome Champagne deal from one of our favorite direct import producers - Fallet Dart. From the 2008 vintage, this Champagne is not only bright and lively, but also rich with baked apple and leesy character. I would bet this bubbly will only get better in the next couple years.
",Other White Wines
"This latest champagne drop has our staff and customers loudly buzzing.  From one of our top grower imports and from easily the best vintage of the last couple decades, the ’08 Millesime from Fallet Dart is 70% Chardonnay, 30% Pinot Noir from the estate’s best parcels, aged 8 years on the lees!  Lemon meringue, nectarine, and pear fruit flavors are intense and amplified by the vintage’s hallmark acidity, while beautiful and fully integrated toasty lees add depth and complexity.  At sub-$40, it seems too good to be true, which means it will probably disappear pretty fast.. Grab yours!
",Other White Wines
"While I wasn't blessed with ""legs for days"" - I CAN have ""length for days"" in this delicious champagne. The 2008 vintage has not let me down yet and this wine is no exception. Lush and complex -- the finish goes on for a mile...At sub-$40, it's a must-try!
",Other White Wines
"Just one swirl and sniff of this wine and you realize how serious it is. Beautifully focused aromas of chalk, citrus peel, toasted barley and a hint of baked pear. On the palate this is a very linear, racy wine with mouth-watering acidity and boundless energy and drive. Right now it's a fantastic aperitif wine with its brightness and verve. I suspect it will settle in later life to become richer and broader like great vintage Champagne does. The youthful vivacity and exuberance of now will be replaced by complexity and depth that only time can bring. It's quite staggering to think you can buy age-worthy vintage Champagne of this quality for this price point.
",Other White Wines
"Fresh, zippy, bright--these are some of the terms you will hear us use to describe this enchanting vintage champagne from Fallet Dart, but we wouldn't be doing it justice if we didn't also describe it as complex, with spice and earth, while having depth of fruit from the 30% of Pinot Noir, and its amazing ability age. While this would be a fantastic, refreshing champagne to enjoy during these next few warm summer months, it also is filled to the brim with potential aging characteristics. The acidity will mellow, the spice and fruit will be brought forward and it will continue to be lush and complex. I say get two bottles--one to enjoy soon and one reward yourself with later! At under $40 you won't regret it!
",Other White Wines
"This is an incredible value for a vintage Champagne that comes with so much complexity and aging potential. Right now this wine is zippy, mineral driven, and bright, with rich undertones and steely drive. In a few years I image the vivid acidity will mellow and the wine will become softer and even more complex while still exhibiting freshness. 2008 is proving itself to be one of the most interesting Champagne vintages in a while and at this price, I will be picking up a few bottles, both to drink now and to hold onto. Can't wait to see what this wine will exhibit in a few years!
",Other White Wines
"Wow! Bright, crisp, and juicy. This can mean that the wine is not complex, but not here - there is enough going on to add wonderful mouthfeel, and a long creamy finish.

"This vintage 2008 Champagne is an absolute steal! The wine is so bright and tightly focused. To me it has the intensity of fruit found in the finest 2014 white burgundies and a lovely chalky finish. I could certainly love it right now with a slice of country pate but this wine will really reward time in the cellar and at this price that is where I'm putting it.

"The value that Patrick Arnould delivers with this top-notch rosé is mind boggling. This is the only rosé Champagne that I have ever had that is exclusively Pinot Noir, but made by blending wines that are vinified white with wines that are vinified red. Patrick is very proud of his Burgundian clones in his best exposed vineyard plot that he uses to make the red wine that gives this Champagne its color and flavor. This rosé has dark cherry authority as well as complex savor from that high quality vineyard. It also has easy refreshment and a dry chalky finish from the rest of his Grand Cru estate vineyard that makes the white Pinot portion. A must try for every rosé fan, and a stunning value.
",Other White Wines
"An amazing expression of what high quality Pinot Noir from Champagne can accomplish. This rosé delivers a wine with power and finesse, full rich red fruit and bright fresh acidity. Upfront the nose is full of strawberries in fresh cream, leading into a savory cassis character. Broad and weighty on the palate, hard candy and blackberry abound. Cleaned up around the edges with precise acidity that lifts the wine and makes it one of the most well-rounded rosés we carry.
",Other White Wines
"Tasted this at the San Francisco store and promptly took one home for dinner. This is a great, and versatile, food wine. About 15% of the blend is vinified red, which gives it the stuffing to stand up to a variety of foods, but it is still elegant with persistent bubbles carrying the berry fruits along. Duck confit salad with cherries would be a perfect match.  100% Grand Cru Pinot Noir for $35?  Yes, please!

"This value champagne leaves other value champagnes in the dust. A well known producer using almost one third reserve wine, half chardonnay and giving the wine three years to age on it's lees. It is textured, complex and elegant. Filled with fresh yellow apples and baking spices on the nose and palate and just enough acidity and minerality to keep it lively. While the wine's complexity make it easy to enjoy on it's own, it's bright character keep it very food friendly. Delicious, versatile, and price friendly- what more could you ask for?

"This delicious and classic Brut is an elegant delight, with a light lemony and herbaceous aroma, with three years on the lees. The palate is very balanced, clean and dry, but the star of this wine is a chalky and fresh mineral component. The Laurent Perrier Brut is a perfect guest to any gathering, and is really suited for most any palate or dish.
",Other White Wines
"There is a reason Laurent Perrier has such a following and reputation and that is because it sits at the perfect intersection of taste, recognizability, and value. Lovely notes of orchard fruit with some creamy richness and notes of yeast are all balanced by a core of acid and a beautiful finish. This is a wine for celebrating the small things like going over to a friends house, and the big things like ordering a pizza once you get there.

"Our last shipment of this version of the ever solid Laurent Perrier Brut (they are about to release a brand new cuvee, which will soon be arriving into our stock as well), it features a generous 50% portion of chardonnay (35% PN and 15% Pinot Meunier round out the blend) with three years on the lees. Citric, and appley, the wine has direct appeal but also a little something extra, a notable mineral/saline edge. Very tasty, and nearly impossible to go wrong with this lovely Champagne .

"The LP non-vintage is made in a very open-knit, pleasing style. Layers of rich apple and golden pear are enveloped by toasted bread and candied citrus peel.

"The 2009 Dom Perignon is one of the purest and most elegant that I have had of this famous tete de cuvee. I had an opportunity to taste a preview bottle back in March, and I was very impressed. The wine is much less yeasty than the 2006, and has rounder, riper fruit than the more mineral driven 2004. In an unusual move, but certainly a smart one, they decided to release this ahead of the 2008, which is still resting on its lees in Epernay!

"Several years back while on one of his many buying trips to France, Clyde discovered the exceptional productions of this Southwestern, Languedoc producer and decided to begin importing them for us. Instead of importing their entire line, Clyde made the decision, at that time, to bring in only their fabulous Rosé, which we rapidly sold through some 400 cases after it arrived. Then last year, he decided to also bring in not only their Rosé, but also their Blanc and Rouge, which were equally wonderful wines. I am solidly in love with their Blanc, which is a blend of Grenache Blanc (75%) and Viognier (25%). This is a lovely refreshing, clean, crisp, mouthwatering Gem with the Grenache Blanc providing a lime zest to Chilean jasmine fruit tone, while the Viognier adds a honeydew melon quality with viscosity and weight (not reductive from wood aging – all stainless steel) in the mouth. The nose is distinctive and floral, and the finish refreshing and bright. According to The Bean, we need several cases of this Gem to have with our fish dinners. Drink near-term. A DELIGHTFUL.

"This is great Champagne- and perhaps one of the best values for money in any category of wine. Louis Roederer has been pushing quality like few others in the region over the last decade, and no wine shows the heights that they have reached as well as the Brut Premier. With massive investment in organic viticulture, including a massive purchase of 1er vineyards from Leclerc-Briant, a return to plowing in the vineyard instead of chemical treatment and obsession with every detail in the winery they have created something here that has no rival among the big names, especially at this price. The 1/3 of the fruit that they buy comes from growers like Benoit Marguet- so you know they are getting top stuff. While most of my time is spent advocating for single origin Champagnes, this bottle is a great argument for blending and the balance that cellar master Jean-Baptiste Lecaillon created here is second to none. This wine has a great brioche nose and plenty of vivacious sparkle. It is a perfect aperitif!
",Other White Wines
"This is my favorite entry tier wine from a big house. The quality is a step above due to careful wine making and a touch of reserve wines in the blend to add depth and nuance to a very affordable bottle of bubbles. Taking a look at my notes going back three testing’s, the most consistent  notes that came up again and again were delicate white flowers and spiced pears, these delicate flavors combine with good acidity and a finely textured mouth feel make for a bottle of wine that can be enjoyed by many.

"This is one of my favorite Grand Marque houses and this particular champagne has great quality and is also a really good value. Toasty nose, with rich fruit.

"Made from half estate and half purchased fruit, all 1er and Grand Cru sources, Louis Roederer's Brut Premiere is a sophisticated, elegant Champagne that has minerality, flavor, acidity, and length of the sort you might expect to find in a bottle from one of our small grower-producer DIs as opposed to a ""big"" house. This can be attributed to the fact that even at this entry level, the wine originates as a vineyard or fruit selection, not a tank selection like other large production houses. This is a superb Champagne and great value. Whether you are a Champagne novice or connoisseur, shopping for a gift or a bottle to open and enjoy yourself, don't overlook this because you recognize the label - this seriously good Champagne is sure to impress.

"There’s a real purity of fruit to Cristal’s 2009: apple shines through, with lovely sweetness tempered by bright acid and a delicate finish. This is an easygoing vintage, so much so that Roederer pushed it ahead of the more structured 2008, and there’s a lot to love about this layered release: creamy roundness, subtle leesy character, and for the first time, all organic, Grand Cru vineyard sources! 40% Chardonnay from chalky soil adds freshness, while the remaining 60% Pinot Noir lends accessibility. Cristal is always a treat, but the complex, age-worthy 2009 overdelivers.

"Among the prestige cuvées in Champagne, Louis Roederer’s Cristal stands out for its delicacy, purity and precision.  It is made entirely from mid-slope Grand Cru vines, with no malolactic fermentation and seven years of lees aging.  Even in its relative youth, the 2009 displays a meticulous nature: mouth watering, fresh citrus fruit and white flower flavors with subtle underlying pastry notes that meld seamlessly with the richness from the long lees aging.  This impressive vintage will last at least 30 years, so set a couple aside!

"For many years now, Champagne Louis Roederer has been leading the way in progressive practices in the vineyard in the region. This approach showed in the wines at this year’s staff summit, and in a quite spectacular way. The wines of Roederer really have a shine to them, and the soon to be released 2009 Louis Roederer ""Cristal"" Brut Champagne exemplifies this luminescent style. Roederer has been the largest organic vineyard owner in Champagne for many years, and this is the first year that Critstal has been made exclusively from these organic, mid slope, pure chalk sites. The ripe vintage of 2009 has made for a precocious wine that is already showing much more aroma and giving much more pleasure than Cristal normally does when first released. That being said, this is a chalky, complex, detailed Champagne that has decades and decades of time to shine!

"Pure and fresh, this is a delicious dry white wine.  Lugana is one of Italy's most popular white wines, probably because the good ones like this are so smooth, light, and easy to drink.  This wine comes from the southern shores of Lake Garda.  This is the perfect wine for your summer sipping and Sunday brunches.

"The nose of this wine is sensual, it initially seems somewhat like stone fruits but it’s beyond that there’s almost a texture in the nose, it fills the air around you not with a floral component but a heady, musky almost humid richness. On the palate you see the wine is full immediately, all stainless steel but there’s a richness that gives creaminess to the wine that is ultra pleasing to the palate. Not that the wine is flabby it has excellent acidity with hints of minerality to lift it on the end of the palate. The flavors are a bit of peach, nectarine and pear subtle but substantive highlighted with dried white flowers. The finish is long lasting and replays the wine’s richness, complex stone fruits all lifted to an excellent finish.
",Other White Wines
"After tasting this new arrival I would never have guessed it was a 2014 but rather a 2015. It's bold and intensely concentrated with a surprising amount of acidity that makes it the complete package. Although it's full and round, it's also light on its feet. Rich honey and minerals emerge on the palate and continue on a long finish. It reminded us somewhat of a well made Chenin Blanc with the uniqueness that makes it truly Italian. Seafood, white meats and egg dishes with this one.

"In a lineup with 12 other Grand Marques, Champagne Charlie was at the top of my list of favorites.  The Brut Reserve uses up to 20-year-old reserve wines for 40% of its blend and combines the flavors of fresh stone fruit and pears with quince and dried apricots for a rich, but ultimately refreshing and vibrant profile.

"Simply delicious, the Charles Heidsieck Champagnes have improved so drastically lately that if you haven't tried them recently you owe it to yourself to try one now.  Bold nutty, toasty and rich, but not lumbering or cloying - it has a lovely acidity to finish it off.  Bravo!
",Other White Wines
"My jaw almost dropped when I learned the story of the new Charles Heidsieck from Cecile Bonnefond, the CEO of both Charles and Piper. Instead of the normal package change / price increase rationalized by “increased international demand” this wine had been improved at great cost to the producer before the price went up! The new package contains a selection of half the vineyard sites of the old one, and older reserve wines. The result is non-vintage Champagne that is better than most big house vintage wines and a stronger value now at the current price than the old Charles was at $34.99. When we poured this at a recent in-store tasting on “House Style” it was one of the stars of the night. This Champagne has depth, combining maturity and freshness, nutty intrigue and minerality!

"Floral and slightly fruity on the nose, the Cuvée Christophe is well rounded, and perfectly balanced with great minerality and acidity. The 2016 vintage definitely carries the very essence of what a Rhone white should taste like. I couldn't help but think of how many oysters I wanted to eat with this wine. Here's to another fantastic year in the Rhone Valley with the 2016 vintage.
",Other White Wines
"I am such a total Rhone nerd. And being so I loved the 2016 Remizieres Crozes Blanc. It showcases coconut, marzipan, and even a touch of spearmint. But the texture and weight of this wine is where all the intrigue is. This wine has massive size, and the mouthfeel is lush, supple and rounded. This is the luxury edition of the white wine world, that is so totally distinct and yet absolutely grounded in its tradition and history.
",Other White Wines
"Family run for three generations, Domaine des Remizières follows a bio approach and strives to respect the terrior of the vineyards and surrounding environment throughout the year.  The Cuvée Christophe is a blend of 85% Marsanne and 15% Roussanne, 30% of which sees new oak with the remaining 70% fermented in one year old barrel.  There's a sumptuous, round texture with a lift of acidity and a long finish.  Notes of pear blossoms and dried pears, orange oil and white peach giving way to a slight toasted brioche from the new barrel.  One of my favorites from our last tasting and sure to please lovers of white Rhône wines.
",Other White Wines
"This super value N. Rhone white is a bit more vibrant and focused than the last vintage.   Aromas of dried fruit, wet stone, ginger and lanolin are followed by a middle filled with ripe stone fruit..  The  peach, apricot and nectarine flavors are all infused with palate cleansing minerals.

"Sometimes change it difficult, sometimes it is good, very good. The change we see from Laurent Perrier as their Brut label moves into their La Cuvee comes from the addition of Cote de Blanc vineyard sites to their already impressive holdings. The Cote de Blanc, located in the Marne, is known for growing almost exclusively Chardonnay and doing it well (as seen by the 6 Grand Cru villages!) With many options at their fingertips, LP decided to create the La Cuvee as their new entry level label with more, higher quality Chardonnay than the Brut and an extra six months on the lees to keep the texture we know and love. Elegant aromas of yellow apple and baking spice mirror that of the Brut while notes of sweet meyer lemon and hints of anise show this new label's complex nature. The grace and softness of palate from both the lees aging and blend of Pinot Noir and Muenier is not lost from the additional Chardonnay but a soft acidity lifts it slightly while carrying the wine to a long, delicate finish. And as always, Laurent Perrier is bringing all this at an incredible price!
",Other White Wines
"To draw attention to the fact that they have greatly improved the already amazing quality of their standard Brut bottling Laurent Perrier has renamed it ""La Cuvee"".  The bright ""Wedding cake"" aromas and flavors remain but the ""La Cuvee"" is toastier and has a much broader palate impression and a more layered texture.  There is now a rich array of stone fruit flavors that add complexity which combined with the extra weight and length make this a more profound wine and one of the great values in Champagne.
",Other White Wines
"Laurent Perrier will soon be releasing a new bottling of their NV Brut, which will go by the name of ""La Cuvee."" It is not simply a re-launch with a neat new package (well it's that too, of course), but a wine that sees 5% more chardonnay - reflecting their recent purchase of another house with prime Chardonnay holding - as well as an additional 6 months ageing on the lees for a total of 3.5 years lees ageing. And how is the wine? Well, tasted side by side with a bottle of LP's former cuvee, there is a notable difference. Yellow and white fruits on the nose lead to a nicely rich palate, with great presence and autolytic, yeasty qualities. It's saline, intense, and dry, seemingly with a lower dosage than in the past. I like them both, though for my money this new release is definitely a step up!
",Other White Wines
"The ""La Cuvee"" is one phenomenal release from well-known and highly regarded Champagne producer Laurent Perrier. Aged three and a half years on the lees, this wine exhibits the dedication LP shows to the quality of their Champagne. They have chosen to hold this wine back until it is perfected, rather than release it before it has had time to fully develop, even if that means potential years of lost income. The bottling exhibits a juiciness and fuller body than their ""Brut"" sparkler, but is still bright and lively from the acid-driven Chardonnay. While many Champagne houses believe great wine is made in the cellar, not the vineyard, LP shows a dedicated respect to the fruit in their bottlings, with the Chardonnay in ""La Cuvee"" being of exceptional quality. This is a special bottle that is still incredibly affordable and available for everyone to enjoy.
",Other White Wines
"Laurent Perrier has long been a favorite of mine due to its clean, lovely character and combination of quality and value. This new (coming in September) La Cuvee replaces the previous NV Brut. It has a tad more chardonnay and an increased sur lie aging of six months. The result? Even BETTER quality than it previously had! Beautiful nose of saline, cream and lemon meringue. Increased weight on the mid-palate with stone fruits and peachy goodness. Long, lingering finish with key lime, chalk, minerals and nectarine. These is really not much more to ask from this champagne!
",Other White Wines
"How do you make a classic pleasing Champagne even better?  Bring in some new spectacular fruit sources including a lot of Grand Cru Chardonnay and add 'La Cuvee' to the name.  The replacement for the LP Brut is just fantastic!  It shows a more creamy nose next to the previous LP, and a finer more mineral driven palate impression.  The round and fairly ripe apple and peach middle has an appealing steely core, and a chalky minerality underpinning it all.  Even more refined than the Champagne it replaces, LP has an even better winner on their hands here.
",Other White Wines
"Laurent Perrier's ""La Cuvee"" is a more powerful, richer and more focused iteration of their Brut Champagne, with extended aging in the bottle for six months, for a total of three and a half years on the lees. There is a similar clean and citrusy herbaceous quality in the initial aromatics, which speaks to the quality of the Chardonnay that drives the blend. The palate is broader and richer than that of the original Brut, with subtle flavors of white peach and frozen cherry, but a similar, yet more pronounced, chalky minerality comes to the forefront. ""La Cuvee"" is a beautiful Champagne which will delight lovers of their Brut and new fans alike.
",Other White Wines
"If you are a Champagne House that carries the name recognition and appeal of Laurent Perrier how do you change your signature offering? Easy, you introduce a wine like the new La Cuvee. Taking on new vineyards and changing the basic cepage Laurent Perrier also decided that a longer lees time was also just what this new cuvee needed. The result being a continuation of what they are capable of and I believe a treat for all of their customers. This new champagne features a slightly creamier nose than the Brut and is filled with delectable stone fruit, cream, and plenty of balancing acid. I am fairly confident that those who are already familiar with this house will be delighted with this change and the handful of people who haven't tried them yet here is exactly where you should start.
",Other White Wines
"Several years ago, Laurent Perrier was fortunate enough to acquire a small Champagne group that owned vineyards and had some very good contracts in the Côtes de Blancs. This is the first product to be released that includes fruit from these marvelous sites and it is a revelation. They have increased the proportion of chardonnay in the blend to 55% (the balance is 30% pinot noir and 15% meunier), and now only use the first and most delicate portion of the grape pressing, while increasing the aging minimum to over four years on the lees. The result is a Champagne with a near blanc de blancs character, singing with Puligny Montrachet-like lime and vibrant chalk.

"How awesome is it when you're tasting wine that is unique, interesting and delicious only to find out it's less than $15? This is exactly my experience with the Petroni blanc. The quality vs. price ratio on this wine is out of control. It has tons of citrus and tropical notes. It's got that very angular acidity that's particular to Vermentino, but not harsh or overly done. Lots of interesting spice notes tucked away into dark little corners. How much more French Regional can you get than something like this? Dang it, I'm so into this.
",Other White Wines
"Looking for a nice fun, easy drinking white? Well, look no further, Domaine Petroni's Corse Blance may be the answer. The acidity on this wine is bright and well balanced.  Crisp and packed with a light tropical finish. You don't want to miss out on this one.

"Maybe about seven years ago I tasted a few of the bubblies from Loxarel at a Spanish wine trade show in San Francisco. Ever since then I have been hooked. I have consumed so many bottles across their dizzying array of products, and built up so much product conviction along the way, that I would put these up against any sparkling wines in the store. This is the first vintage of Garnatxa Blanca, and the only bubbly made from this grape that I have yet to try. Loxarel's trademark fine bubbles combine with slightly weightier fruit from the high elevation Garnatxa blanca grapes to create something that is equal parts food friendly and refreshing.
",Other White Wines
"This wine from Loxarel is quite unique as it the first year the winery has vinified a sparkling from entirely Garnatxa Blanca. The grapes were harvested from high elevation vineyards in Cataluyna in excess of 2,600 ft and spent at least 15 months of aging on the lees. The wine is also both certified organic and biodynamic. Aromas of white flowers, unripe apple, pear, and white nectarine followed by fresh herbs. A delicious blend of ripe stone and orchard fruit flavors on the palate. Weightier than expected; bubble texture is delicate. Lively acidity with a distinct saline, mineral finish. The salty minerality makes it a great accompaniment with seafood options like oysters and anchovies
",Other White Wines
"An interesting, unique and totally fun semi-sparkling wine from Greece.  Unlike any other orange wine I've had, the palate on this has a touch of sweetness to mitigate the tannin that can sometimes overwhelm orange wine aka skin contact whites.  It's fruity and floral, while also possessing some savory notes and a whiff of Brettanomyces.  Notes of dried mango, spice inflected candied orange peel and gardenia mingle with more savory elements like olives and earthen pots.  This is a very friendly entry into orange wines for the uninitiated, but would also satisfy those who are already familiar with the style.  This would be killer with a cheese and charcuterie board or a Neapolitan style pizza.
",Other White Wines
"One of the most unique and pleasing wines I’ve tried in a long time. This wine is from the region of Epirus in Greece, not far from the border with Albania. Comprised of 97% Debina and 3% Vlahiko; both are indigenous varietals with Debina being white and Vlahiko being red. It is a revival of the well-known traditional semi-sparkling wine of Ioannina. Exciting nose of florals, dried tarragon, apricots, and marmalade. There’s a quality to it that is almost reminiscent of Normandy cider. On the palate, flavors of bruised apple and clay are accented by apricot and cider notes. I wouldn’t classify this wine as off-dry, but there is definitely some residual sweetness that adds a nice balance to the slight grip of the tannins present

"Our best new producer, Arthur Marc makes great Champagne entirely from their estate in the Marne. They are located in the beautiful village of Fleury-la-Riviere with heritage in the region going back 12 generations... All the way to the 1600's!

"It can be tricky to define pricey Rosé Champagne as a bargain, but when one considers just how much quality there is in each bottle of Laurent-Perrier, it suddenly seems underpriced. Made with extended maceration and using the more difficult saignée method, their Cuvée Rosé is special.  Brilliant red berry fruit shines through the lifted palate, with both richness and minerality coming through to the clean finish.  This is a substantial rose – great with food – yet elegant with tiny bubbles and a citrusy freshness.  The fact that the bottle is gorgeous and the house pedigree dates back to 1812 only adds to the glamour of this lovely Pinot Noir Champagne.
",Other White Wines
"Everything about the Cuvée Rosé is rich and seductive:  the deep pink hue, the lush Pinot Noir fruit flavor, the silky texture.  The fruit, entirely Grand Cru Pinot Noir, is destemmed, crushed and left in contact with the skins for an unusually long 72 hours, before being vinified and aged on the lees for four years.  The result is a wine rich in the pure flavors of ripe strawberries, raspberries and black cherries and hazelnuts with a creamy texture, crisp bubbles, and incredible length.  This is a very delicious — and unique—rosé Champagne.
",Other White Wines
"If you haven't tasted the LP Rose lately, you should! This all Pinot Noir Champagne is entirely made from Grand Cru fruit and lighter than most that are made in this style- it is macerated with all of the skins in contact with all of the juice.

"Stylistically, Laurent Perrier is one of my favorite Grand Marques. I gravitate towards their bright, vibrant house style and that's exactly what you get in the Laurent Perrier ""Cuvee Rose"" Brut Rose Champagne. While the rose is 100% Pinot Noir and macerated with full skin contact, this rose is surprisingly lifted and understated for receiving such a heavy-handed treatment. The nose and palate are loaded with copious amounts of red berry fruit with ripe strawberries taking center stage supported by a backdrop of clean minerality.  The refreshingly tart finish of cranberries and pomegranate make this rose the perfect accompaniment to any special occasion.
",Other White Wines
"Intriguing rose that begins in an understated elegant way, and builds towards a fuller finish showing off its’ Grand Cru providence.  The nose is hauntingly seductive,  crushed red fruit, a mineral vein, and the faintest scent of rose petal all intermingled in harmony. The palate is defined by a textural grip that adds weight and importance, but the lifted flavors of wild strawberry and cream, with hits of cherry tart keep the wine extremely elegant and pretty. The finish picks up speed with reinforced dark cherry and minerality that wraps the wine up beautifully.
",Other White Wines
"This Brut Rose has consistently been the darling of both staff and customers. It is composed of 100% pinot noir and retains a classic, clean, fresh raspberry and strawberry character. it fleshes out on the mid-palate with ripe strawberry fruit but, ends  with the classic LP clean and mineral-driven finish. Classic Brut Rose!

"Bright, rich, ripe Rose Champagne with lovely fruit and excellent purity. It shows some subtle notes of crushed mint and strawberry coulis.

"One of my favorite things about Meunier dominant Champanges is the depth, fullness and polish it adds to a wine.

Billecart-Salmon is my go-to Champagne when looking for a crowd-pleasing yet sophisticated sparkler.

An easygoing, impressive favorite that never disappoints, plus it's an incredibly reasonable price, especially for a half bottle.

"A bouquet of flowers in the glass!!! That is the first association that comes to my mind that I smell this wine. Indigenous grape of Greece, Moschofilero has always been one of my favorites. I love the combination of bright floral notes and zippy acidity with lovely white peach undertones and hint of exotic fruit. If you enjoy mineral Chablis, definitely give this wine a try; if you love aromatic Viognier, give this Moschofilero a go; if you love Sauvignon Blanc, but want to try something else, try this crisp Greek wine, because it combines all these features -- minerality, acidity and beautiful white flower aromas.
",Other White Wines
"I don't have much experience with Greek wines, but after tasting this Moscofilero I will definitely start drinking more! With the first sniff, I was hooked. The nose is full of floral and stone fruit notes while the palate was nicely structured with acid and finished dry and minerally. At an affordable price, this wine will be making its way into my fridge.
",Other White Wines
"Moscofilero is one of the classic and great white grapes of Greece and Skouras is a master working with this grape. The 2016 has pronounced beautiful and inviting floral  aromatics. In the mouth it is medium bodied with stone fruit flavors and is soft, round and dry. It has a nice subtle crisp finish which gives  balance.  Skouras Moscofilero is easy enough to drink alone but will go well with lighter foods. Simply put, this is a tasty wine.
",Other White Wines
"Having never tried this varietal, I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  What a pleasant surprise!  Bright stone fruit scents of yellow plums and ripe peaches were the first notes I got out of the glass.  This wine is aromatic, refreshing and just plain delicious.  The varietal is Moscofilero, and it come from the Peloponnese peninsula in one of Greece's most historic wine regions, untouched by phylloxera.  The producer, George Skouras, a Burgundy trained winemaker for the past fifteen years has brought his expertise to Greece and is bringing his estate to the forefront of Greek winemaking.  There's some really intersting complexity, with a floral note of orange blossoms and something savory to round out this charming little discovery.  Perfectly enjoyable on it's own, but would also pair well with a wide range of lighter fare.  Think mediteranean when pairing with food...
",Other White Wines
"I visited the Skouras property a few years ago and it was incredible to see the strides that proprietor George Skouras was making as both an oenologist and ambassador for Greek wines.  Being one of the first generation of winemakers to study abroad and then bring his knowledge home, George dazzles with his vibrant personality and limitless wine knowledge.  Skouras has done amazing things with red wines, playing with classic indigenous varieties like Agiorgitiko as well as tweaking the international grapes like Cabernet and Merlot into something wholly Greek in their character.  George was the first person to make a ""Super Greek"" wine when he blended Cabernet and Agiorgitiko in his now titular, Megas Oenos cuvee.   Our first encounter was a dinner with a group of buyers and sommeliers at a beach side restaurant outside of his home village of Argos, near Nafplion.  He started us with an aperitif of his Moscofilero with some mezza of lightly fried fish, olives and dolmas.  The grape itself is actually rose colored like a Pinot Gris but produces a white wine with much more aromatic punch like a Muscat or Viognier.  It was an exceptional way to refresh the palate and begin the evening.  We recently received the newest vintage of the 2016 which immediately brought me back to that evening with the water lapping at the sand on the beach, laughter of my wine geek friends in the air and servers sneaking off to watch bits and pieces of an important football (soccer) game on television.  All the floral punch is there but the beautiful thread of lemony acidity keeps the wine from becoming heavy or overwhelming.  With its crispness and expressive nature, this white, much like George Skouras himself, is the perfect ambassador to the Greek wine experience whether you sip it on a beach, serve it at a garden party with little nibbles or drink it while watching baseball or soccer on TV.
",Other White Wines
"I love wines made from indigenous Greek varietals especially when producers like Georges Skouras take care and attention to work with these varietals and develop their complexity. The Skouras is an incredible example of how the best Moscofilero can be delicate and ethereal, while still having loads of personality.  This wine is aromatic, with notes of rose petal and flint jumping from the glass. Flavors of lychee, nectarine and sea salt are backed by a core of slate-like minerality. The aromas and flavors of this wine are perfect for outdoor occasions. Whether it's the park, by the sea or the back patio, this bottle pairs perfectly with good weather and great company.

"After tasting the Roeder Estate Anderson Valley Brut Sparkling Wine, it’s hard to believe that it is a domestic sparkling and that it only costs $21.99! What sets this domestic sparkling apart from the rest is how dry it tastes. I always have a problem with how high the dosage levels are in domestic sparkling wines but not with the Roederer Estate Brut. The nose is bright and lively with fresh pear, tangerine and clean bread yeast notes. And while the palate is friendly and accessible with riper pome fruit and clean melon flavors, this domestic brut finishes precise and focused.

For under $35.  Proprietors Elisabeth (Henri Goutorbe’s granddaughter) and Jean-Marie Egrot have a long history in Champagne, and the pedigree shows in the bottle.

"Our staff tasting of the wines from Vigneti Massa was truly a revelation! As someone who does not drink a lot of white wine, this introduction to the Italian grape Timorasso was an exciting new adventure. While it draws on some familiar tastes and sensations comparable to White Burgundies and Rieslings, this grape has a depth and character all of its own. This particular bottling was light, bright, with great minerality and stonefruit undertones. Slightly sweet, refreshingly crisp, this $25 bottle is a heck of a value and a great introduction to a new varietal and producer. Give it a try, and you'll want to know, and taste, more!
",Other White Wines
"Thanks to a recent staff tasting session, I'm quite intrigued by the Timorasso varietal. Hailing from a small region in Italy, and nowhere else, comes this mineral driven white wine with lots of bright acidity, and in this expression, a Riesling-like nose. This has lots going on on the palate with stone fruits and wonderful baking spice. While it continues to change on the palate, offering you hints of other white varietals here and there, no white wine I've ever tasted before, blends flavors and textures so well. Yes, you'll draw comparisons to other white wine varietals, like we did, but until you try it yourself, you'll just have to take our word for how much this wine deserves its own place at your table and in your cellar.

Although not technically a vintage release, this is from the warmer 2009 harvest, making it instantly accessible, with weighty texture and just the right amount of lift. North-facing slopes in Verzenay ripen Pinot Noir beautifully but maintain a snap of acidity that pairs well with sushi, and the raciness here cuts through anything with ponzu sauce. This is easily one of my favorite Pinot-based Champagnes in the store, and a killer value.

"This is one of my very favorite non-vintage Champagnes! Cinnamon and I shipped this to Costanoa, a resort by the beach (better than carrying it on our bicycle!) and enjoyed it alfresco after a day in the saddle. We carried Riedel ""O"" stemless glasses in our jersey pockets (don't try this at home kids!) because we forgot to ship them... We were glad we did. This wine has so much complexity and subtlety it would have been a shame to drink it out of substandard glassware. The Grand Cuvee is very powerful Pinot-based stuff, with a hint of smoke on the nose, a very supple texture and a bone dry, persistent finish. A great reward after a long ride.
",Other White Wines
"I tried this for the first time recently and was thoroughly impressed with the quality of this sub-$40 Champagne.  Located in Verzenay, a historical Grand Cru rich in calcareous soil, this Champagne is full of ripe white cherries and hazelnuts with a touch of toasty croissant.  It's balanced beautifully between richness and brightness with a bracing vein of acidity running through.  Pick up a bottle for your next dinner date or party.
",Other White Wines
"Well balanced, rich, but not overbearingly so. Who knew we'd have so many fantastic Grand Cru champagnes at such a fantastic price, and this here is no exception. This champagne finishes off with a nice toasted hazelnut finish, that simply makes this grand cru irresistible!
",Other White Wines
"One of the true staff favorites, this Champagne comes off as rich and ripe, but the acidity cuts right through leaving an extremely well balanced, wonderfully complex and driving wine in your glass. Black cherry, brioche, and hazelnut complement. Think Krug at almost a quarter of the price!

"Rich, yet exquisitely balanced, the Michel Arnould Grand Cuvée Brut has a subtle minerality on the nose, the classic bright cherry fruit in the mouth and an elegant, seamless hazelnut finish.  Try with some seared sea scallops in a citrus cream reduction.

"Lovely toast on the nose. Classic pain grille, bright cherry, and hazelnut in the mouth. The ripeness of the fruit is offset by bracing acidity and an intense mineral character. A big, bold wine, this champagne will be the center of attention at any party.

"This Marne rosé is the rich delicious result of the maceration method, where the skins of Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier are left in contact with the wine for two days, giving it its rich pink color and round texture.  The flavor profile is a great combination of bright red fruit with darker herbal elements for a very complete and satisfying rosé experience. 
",Other White Wines
"A pleasing, plush style with plenty of red fruits, subtle herbal notes due to the percentage of Pinot Meunier, and a very favorable toasty quality. I enjoyed this with friends after a long work week and it certainly did not disappoint.

"Louis Roederer continues to be one of my favorite, go to grand marque Champagnes. This vintage rosé is everything that I am looking for in pink Champagne - bright, crunchy red berry flavors, well integrated acidity, dosage and bubbles, and a well defined minerality which I find present in all of Louis Roederer Champagnes. The difference in their vintage dated wines is added intensity on the mid-palate and more length on the finish. Well worth the price, I find this to be one of our better values in vintage, grand marque Champagne!
",Other White Wines
"2011 may have been a difficult vintage, but it does not show in this rose from Louis Roederer. Ripe red fruits and blood orange are paired with floral, toast and orchard fruits. The refreshing acidity is in perfect balance with the complex flavors and aromas in this Champagne and can be enjoyed now or cellared for a few more years.
",Other White Wines
"The nose is full of  apple blossom, ripe pear and jasmine and while that sounds tres exotic the nose is actually really vinous. On the palate the 2016 vintage shows its ripeness but Vietti's Arneis has excellent balance and acidity to support the extra mid palate richness. It finishes clean, focused and gives you the sense that you had a wine of substance, perfect for a pasta primavera or grilled shrimp.
",Other White Wines
"Tangy acidity focuses this firm, snappy white. The palate is subtle and creamy, offering an elegant mix of almond skin, crunchy white peach and pink grapefruit granita.

"Situated in the Minervois, an oft-overlooked region within the Languedoc-Roussillon, the winemakers at Chateau Saint Jacques d'Albas favor a more natural approach to wine making, approaching the vinification process with minimal intervention.  They limit yields to produce more expressive grapes and utilize organic methods when managing the soil and the vines.  What you get is an intensely flavorful wine for an incredible bargain.  The blending of Viognier, Vermentino and Roussanne creates a well balanced and aromatic wine.  Notes of honeysuckle, lemon zest and stone fruit pop, while the bright acid is balanced by a roundness and overall medium body.  Fans of unoaked Chardonnay should give this a try if you're looking to expand your repertoire and try something new.
",Other White Wines
"This dry Amontillado is a perfect accompaniment to cured meats and other Spanish style snacks.  With its beautiful amber color, this Amontillado has pungent aromas of roasted nuts, coffee and dried figs, while the palate includes candied orange peel, seawater, toffee and butterscotch. Its pronounced flavors open up your pairing possibilities to more than just snacks, it could even hold up to a full array of grilled meats.
",Other White Wines
"If you’re looking for a good dry Amontillado, you’ve found your bottle here; this is a lot of sherry for the money! The Los Arcos offers expansive and intense flavors on a well balanced frame. Toasted almond and dried fruit aromas are followed by flavors of salty, toasted nuts juxtaposed nicely against a mellow sweetness. The finish is crisp and dry. What it might lack in nuance when compared to some pricier bottlings it more than makes up for in overall harmony and depth of flavor. Lovely stuff.Incidentally, if you’re making atavistic cocktail recipes such as the Bamboo or the Tuxedo that call for dry sherry, the Los Arcos shows to good effect in them. It doesn’t get lost in the mix the way pretty much any Manzanillas or Finos I’ve used to date seem to.

"Most often Pinot Meunier is the backup dancer to Chardonnay and Pinot Noir in Champagne, but Fallet-Dart has taken the chance to bring it center stage in their Grand Reserve! I fell for PM-heavy Champagnes last year when I had one from Michel Loriot, and they continue to stun me with their suppleness, bold aromatics and concentration while still being fresh, long lived, and elegant. The Grand Reserve checks off all those desired characters and is extremely food-friendly. My fiance and I enjoyed this with a rotisserie chicken, fresh bread and cheese—absolutely delicious! It is weighted enough to stand up to the rich meal while the unanticipated acidity refreshes the palate. With that said, I think the wine is extremely versatile and could be paired with lighter dishes such as sautéed white fish with a white bean and tomato salad or even a grilled chicken salad. Either way, I will be drinking it again soon!
",Other White Wines
"This delicious Champagne is aged four years on the lees, and crafted from only Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier. The result is a rich, toasty Champagne rich in brioche, red apple and Marcona almond flavors, but with a surprisingly perfumed finish, with slight tropical flavors of white peach and honeysuckle.
",Other White Wines
"The Fallet-Dart house has a mind blowing history with 17 generations behind the line to perfect their Champagne and perfect it they have. With majority Pinot Meunier and four years of aging sur lees this bottle shows a richer, toastier style while still showcasing brightness and freshness hard to achieve with this blend. I love that Fallet-Dart is not afraid to experiment with a Pinot Meunier heavy blend, though it is not by chance it turned out phenomenally with the clear dedication and hard work in the craft they put in year after year.
",Other White Wines
"One of our newest DI from Champagne and again I feel that it is a little ridiculous to drink Champagne at this level for this price. The Fallet-Dart wines all share a beautiful toasty note to them that comes from long aging on the lees. Although there are other, more manipulative ways, to create this toasty note, the fact that Fallet-Dart can achieve it and have it age is only because they allow their wine to rest until it is ready. As toasty and rich as the nose is, there is no buttery note here; instead bright, clean acid and notes of lemon and spice zip along the palate and help give it a long finish.
",Other White Wines
"The Fallet-Dart Champagnes all represent fantastic values, and there are a number to choose from depending on your preference and budget.  Each on shows a lovely toasty note from their preference for long lees contact.  The Grand reserve is rich but has a lovely crunchy crispness of fresh citrus over red apple fruit.  It finishes up with a very refreshing clean snap.
",Other White Wines
"70% Pinot Meunier, 30% Pinot Noir.  I had this recently to celebrate a good friend’s birthday and we were all stunned by its goodness!  It had wonderful fresh pear and apple fruit notes, a broad presence on the palate, and a crisp finish that left a nice yeastiness lingering for over a minute!  If you’re on the grower-producer train, this is an essential!
",Other White Wines
"The 2011 is creamier and a bit richer than the 2010, though maintaining the dry, linear features that give this wine its unique character. Flavors of apple, lemon, and stony/chalky minerals gain extra roundness from the extended time (six-plus years) on the lees. Instead of crunchy green apples, the profile here shows more ripened, baked golden apples, hints of baking spice, and moussey bubbles. This profound and versatile wine will pair perfectly with the same foods you might pair with Champagne, from creamy Mahon cheese to fresh yellowtail crudo, or even buttermilk fried chicken. Enjoy!

"Once again, another release of Loxarel Reserva Familiar brings the goods. As always, the aromatics are filled with generous yellow fruits, clean chalk and some traces of the Mediterranean countryside. It's the palate where the fireworks really begin: ripe citrus fruits show real precision and a mouthwatering saline quality as well, with a fine stream of bubbles creating a wonderful texture, and flavors that linger nicely long after taking a sip of the wine. For this organic, estate grown, old vine Xarel-lo dominated blend, carefully aged on its lees for over five years and then hand disgorged (and hand labelled!) to come in at under $20 is mind boggling. I don't say this lightly, but pound for pound, euro for euro and dollar for dollar, this is my favorite bottle of bubbles in the store.

"Gosset wines prove that Champagne need not exist on a richness to freshness spectrum, but that both sensations can be achieved in unison to magnificent ends. On the nose, the Brut Excellence displays lovely chalk and sweet pastry notes.  The Pinot Noir takes over on the palate with rich red fruit elements which meld perfectly into a pronounced acid-driven freshness and a creamy, silky texture at the same time!  A remarkable combination!
",Other White Wines
"This lovely bubbly is excellent and is also a great value! Initially, it is rich with baked bread scents, vanilla and luscious yellow fruits. On the palate, it starts off rich and heady with rich mid-palate of Bartlett pears and fresh cream. The finish is a nice surprise, with bright acidity and just a hint of minerality. One of my favorite memories of this wine was having it with Caprese fare on a lovely warm night in Epernay. It was the perfect apertif!

"Half-bottles are not always the most economical option for Champagne, but Aspasie's 375 mls prove to be an incredible exception. Holiday-ready, the current release of Carte Blanche still spends five years on the lees, and has the biscuity notes to prove it, but shows even crisper acidity. Paul-Vincent Ariston is committed to making high quality entry level wine, and there’s no doubt he’s accomplished that here. A traditional cépage of 40% Chardonnay and 30% each of Pinot Noir and Meunier, the Carte Blanche shows apple and crunchy pear fruit, tempered by underlying chalky notes, mousse texture, and a toasty finish. This is a bright spot in our DI Champagne line up – both figuratively and stylistically – and I'm happy to turn savvy drinkers on to this value.

"We have been working with Aspasie for years, as they were our first direct import Champagne producer. Their wine continues to be of the highest quality, making it the best value Champagne in the store. Year after year, the rosé is my favorite rosé in the store.

Try it with a roast duck or heavier fish like salmon or tuna steak.

"While so many of the Moscato d'Astis in our market are made commercially in large quantites, the same cannot be said of this one. It's really quite special and, in our opinion, among the best made. Gianni and Paola Doglia own a small property near Castignole Lanze, Asti that producers a mere 3500 cases per year. Their Moscato offers an impressive aromatic array of white peach, melon, orange and honey as well as a zesty and refreshing palate of creamy goodness. It's pleasantly sweet yet very fresh making it especially good at the end of a meal or on a hot afternoon.

"As I am also the new German and Alsatian buyer at K&L I may have geeked-out a little while trying this wine for the first time, but the wine certainly delivered with a clean, refined, yet uniquely expressive voice that I was hoping to find.  This wine is a true field blend (harvested and fermented together; rare in the modern era) with three Alsatian varietals: 80% Gewurztraminer, 10% Riesling, and 10% Pinot Gris; thus the name TORU or “three” in the Maori language.  Initially I told myself I would hunt for all three varietals on the nose but what I found was much more.  In the glass it started with white and yellow honeysuckle flowers, lime blossom, honeycomb and a briny essence that leaned toward Mediterranean sea salt.  The quartz minerality that developed was a welcome surprise after a few swirls in the glass.  The wine has real “tension” and precision; high praise if used to describe German wines to a German!  On the palate I found a gripping wine that is beautifully confounding and amazingly harmonious.  Trying to pull the tree varietals apart was a fool’s errand and I was better served understanding the precision and style intended by a master winemaker.  Fresh not sweet, and at 13.5% alcohol most would probably define the wine as dry – I would.  This wine came home with me and Thai was its happy partner!
",Other White Wines
"A fantastic Thanksgiving wine. This delicious and  versatile white field blend combines the wonderful aromatics of Gewurtz, the textural qualities of Pinot Gris and the acidic backbone and minerality of Riesling. All fruit is from the organically farmed home block at Te Whare Ra with the Riesling coming from 38 year old vines. This is super quaffable and refreshing but still has detail and complexity. Another cracker from TWR.
",Other White Wines
"This is a truly lovely wine from a rather off-the-beaten-path region. This lovely little white wine is both crisp, refreshing, and complex.

"Don't let the less than famous 2011 vintage fool you- this is flat out one of the top Pinot Noir Champagnes that we have in the store at any price. It is composed exclusively from old massal selected vineyards in the grand cru of Verzenay, and manages to be both very concentrated, powerful and rich as well as maintaining a chalky lift that only the best terroirs can offer in Champagne. If you are looking for kaleidoscope like, multi faceted Champagne this is for you. Too bad we only received five cases!
",Other White Wines
"I love Pinot Noir Champagnes.  I’m always stunned at the power and grace of the good ones, and the Memoire de Vignes from Michel Arnould is, for me, the pinnacle of that style.  Made exclusively from the oldest of their estate Grand Cru vines, the precision and depth here are stunning.   The rich fruit flavors (think mirabelles, golden apples, cherries, dried apricots) are met on the back end by an equally intense acidity, brimming with minerals and soft spice notes.  As you let it warm in your glass, the complexity and length explode!  This is a world class, vintage Champagne offered at a mind bogglingly low price.

"The 2006 Ellner Seduction opens with a yeasty, brioche nose and hints of geranium. Green apple fruit shines through but the palate is rounder, with supple texture reminiscent of honey. The acid is easygoing without sacrificing lift, and gives way to a chalky, pithy finish. Lots of structure now but should show more of 2006’s ripeness as it ages.
",Other White Wines
"This vintage Champagne gem comes entirely from the Ellner estate: 60% Chardonnay from the Grand Crus of Avize and Chouilly and 40% Pinot Noir from the 1er Cru of Tauxieres. Like all of the Ellner wines, this Seduction has not gone through malolactic fermentation, and as such has very good zip and drive even though it is from quite a ripe vintage. The long, eight year sur-lie aging process has given this wine the classic brioche aromas and fine texture that we want in the best of vintages Champagne.

"This is one of the more low-profile super-values in our direct import portfolio.  Elisabeth Egrot used to sell under her maiden name, Goutourbe, to a large and dedicated fan base. Her new name hasn’t quite gained the same traction, but her wines are better than ever.  This superb vintage offering comes entirely from the Grand Cru village from Ay, from a vintage renowned for the power of its fruit.  The richness and depth of the fruit manifest with flavors of gala apple, anjou pear, sweet Meyer lemon, and dried apricots, with equally intense acidity and minerals (no dosage was added creating superb balance.)   Incredible for sub-$40 Champagne.
",Other White Wines
"Heady with toasty biscuit notes up front, plus golden apple and bright Asian pear throughout the rich palate, Egrot Champagne always delivers, and this well-priced release is no exception. No dosage and clean minerality keep things lively in the glass, but there’s enough juicy citrus fruit to show off the warmer vintage. While the name and label change can make it tricky to recognize this Direct Import as Elisabeth Goutorbe, quality is as strong as ever, and the 2009 is already drinking beautifully.

Before the masses find out about this fine, grower producer and send the price point soaring, make sure to pick up a bottle (or twelve) so you can say you owned it back when it was only $40 a bottle.

"I've always liked Fiano d'Avellino but never had my breath taken away like I have with this wine.  The nose is classic all beeswax and lanolin until the dried flowers and spice kick in. Then on the palate you see the real impressive portion of the wine, the 2015 vintage is sensational and for Sarno the added dimension on palate is incredible, the richness is skewered by a mix of tannin and mineral driven acidity giving it weight with a real lift on the back end. The flavors are a mix of Kaffir lime and ripe Bosc pear that enliven the richness of the wine and seem to create flow. The finish is improperly named, it never seems to finish, just on and on and on, more lime more pear and then that ground mineral zip. I would love to have this with a bigger, more structured fish like Swordfish although I'm sure many of you'd head towards Lobster. I really think this wine is stunning; you definitely need to try this!
",Other White Wines
"Fiano is one of the noble white grapes of Southern Italy and Sarno is without doubt one the finest producers of it. Theirs combines richness and structure and the 2015 vintage takes the aromatics and palate to another level. Subtle scents of beeswax, pear and citrus precede a round and seamless palate with a core of vibrant acidity and a chalky mineral finish. This sensational white will age gracefully and will develop more complex notes of honey and hazelnuts as it matures.
",Other White Wines
"Sarno is one of the greatest for Fiano and I had high hopes for this. Truly text book here with tones of white flowers, ripe peaches and acacia honey. The honey becomes freshly harvest beeswax on the palate with tons of texture and a long finish. Fiano is great when there's acid and this one integrates it perfectly. Another stupendously drinkable wine from Sarno and easy to integrate into almost any meal.

"If you're a lover of vin jaune (yellow wine) like myself, then you are definitely in for a treat with Domaine Dugois's 2010 Arbois Vin Jaune. Funky and all over the place, like any classic wine from Jura, this vin jaune is an untamed beast, and I mean that in the best way possible.

If you love sherry or you're feeling adventurous, and want a fantastic funky white wine, this may be the wine for you.

"This unique wine reveals its seductive nature over time, having spent over six years in old barriques under a thin layer of yeast, or voile, a maturing regimensimilar to sherry, which allows for generous oxidation, slow evaporationand the development of intense, complex flavors of ginger, walnut, currypowder and apricot, with a salty tang. Often served with the local Comtécheese, this famous “yellow wine” will also pair well with mushroomrisottos. And the real beauty of a Vin Jaune? It can age for many decades, if desired.

"The wines of Verzenay are some of my very favorite in all of Champagne, and Patrick Arnould of Champagne Michel Arnould makes some of the very best. This wine has the magical hazelnut quality that many (including myself!) often miss for wood treatment in blind tastings. Because this Grand Cru village faces north the wines are always electric and vibrant, even with high percentages of Pinot in the blend. This is one of our finest values in top grower Champagne, and the price makes it unmissable!
",Other White Wines
"This standard bearer of Champagne Michel Arnould is both high quality and a fine value. The Pinot Noir dominant blend is redolent with deep cherry fruit, toasted nuts and fine acidity. It could err on the side of big and bold but, it stops just short and offers up balance and interesting character. A great bubbly to drink on its own or to pair with fowl, pork or even lighter beef dishes.

"One of the remarkable things about our direct import program in Champagne and the many small grower producers with whom we work is the opportunity to taste wines from a specific region of Champagne, wines that reflect the particular terroir of one village or another. Upon first sip, I absolutely fell in love with the wines of Michel Arnould. In places like Verzenay and Bouzy in the Montaigne de Reims, Pinot Noir is king. These are big, bold, black fruited Champagnes that really deserve to be drunk out of a Burgundy glass and paired with a meal. The Michel Arnould Verzenay Reserve Brut Cham[pagne is a great introduction to the region, and a steal at this price.
",Other White Wines
"Exceedingly well composed, the tension between the palate’s richness and the countervailing tug of acidity is judged just right. Flavor-wise, there’s some nuttiness, white berry, and waxy fruit, with a wee hint of bolete in back of it all. Texturally, it is quite fine: this is the complete package. My only nit to pick here is the under-the -radar label, but don’t let that deter you from the superlative Champagne underneath it.
",Other White Wines
"This is a fantastic non-vintage bottling from Michel Arnould.

"Full of vibrancy and richness playing off of each other in perfect harmony, the Michel Arnould Reserve is a stunning example of Grand Cru Champagne. Out of the gate with beautiful aromas of perfectly ripened melon, green apple and spice cake, the nose is effusive and rich. The palate plays fresh notes of watermelon and racy acidity against richer tones of hazelnut and bread dough. The marriage of the racy and rich are what really make this a very complete and extraordinarily pleasing bottle to drink. Powerful and elegant at the same time--that only can be achieved with the highest quality terroir available in the region.

"This all Meunier Champagne is made by Jerome Trudon, who used to make the wine at Roederer, both in Anderson Valley and in Reims. He returned to his family farm, and the Monochrome is his flagship. It is made entirely out of Meunier, aged for three years minimum on the lees and benefits from 1/3 reserve wines from older vintages. This is strikingly pure Meunier, with great white flowers and fresh bread on the nose and in the mouth. It is very fresh, as Jerome does not let the wine go through malolactic, and has very good length and quite a bit of minerality.

"A more weighty and richly styled Salnes Valley Albarino, this still is plenty fresh, with tasty stone fruit flavors and wonderful fruit/acid balance. Great Albarino for the price!

"Pierre Paillard is one of  my favorite Champagne producers. The Les Parcelles  is lively with exceptional  finesse and flavor. It is very dry but not austere because the quality of the fruit used helps make a giving and delicious Champagne with mineral notes and wonderful balance. This is delicious and very enjoyable.
",Other White Wines
"Bring on the weddings and summer celebrations! Les Parcelles Bouzy Grand Cru is sure to please the most discerning of palates. A beautifully balanced blend of all grand-cru pinot noir and chardonnay, Les Parcelles is very dry with an almost negligible dosage. This Champagne has a rich mouthfeel with flavors of lemon meringue and a dry, chalky minerality. A fantastic value for a grand cru Champagne.
",Other White Wines
"Bouzy Grand Cru superstar! Such brilliant purity of fruit here – the nose is classic red berried Pinot Noir, while the bright acidity of Chardonnay shines through the palate. “Les Parcelles” is surprisingly juicy for the low dosage (3.5g!), and although the linear minerality shows up in a big way, this is easygoing for racy Extra Brut. Add its delicate bead and lingering finish and you have incredible quality non-vintage Champagne with the muscle to age well while drinking beautifully now. I indulgently paired this Pierre Paillard with weeknight Thai takeout and it was one of my happiest meals of the year.
",Other White Wines
"Light, bright and golden on the eyes, this delicate champagne displays tight, creamy bubbles with the aroma of fresh, zesty citrus peel. On the mouth, the entry is marked with lively acidity, a hint of toast, wet stone and green apple. Poised and pretty, this is a super treat and a perfect celebratory cuvée at a well-priced $50 mark. Super recommended!
",Other White Wines
"Non-vintage Champagne does not get much better than this. The Paillard family makes a statement with this great cuvee and show how very serious that they are about quality. All of the details have been studied and sweated over to make this wine, from planting only massal selected vines, to working towards an organic certification. This is Champagne that has power without losing its drinkability, and richness without sweetness. If you are only going to try one new Champagne this year, this should be it!
",Other White Wines
"This walks the line between richness and precision, and makes that balancing act look easy. The nose is an interplay of spicy, mineral notes,  lemon zest, toastiness, and nuttiness, with no one element dominating. A fine mousse yields up the generosity of Brioche set against flinty, mineral flavors, with those rocky notions turning in a salty direction on the finish. I regret that we don’t have this in stock all the time, but I’m always happy that we have when we do. Those of you who already know this brut know how good it is; for those who don’t,  reach for a bottle of Pailard’s brut instead of a more familiar Champagne, and you’ll find you have made a new best friend.
",Other White Wines
"Simultaneously delicate and well-structured, this Grand Cru Brut stands head and shoulders above a mountain of clumsy, overly sweet non-vintage Champagne. Balancing pears, lemon curd, gentle minerality, creamy texture, and saline acidity, this certified organic bottling is the roundest, cleanest entry level Champagne to impress my palate in a while. A perfect pairing with almost anything, from duck liver mousse to fried chicken.
",Other White Wines
"For Champagne loves who crave purity and true expression of the land, Pierre Paillard delivers some of the purest and cleanest bubbles that we carry. All from the Grand Cru of Bouzy, the sun warmed and ripened fruit sings out of the glass. Full of orchard and stone fruit bustring from the glass, summer peaches, golden apples, however these notes are balanced perfectly by a saline minerality that lends a light airiness to the wine. With a low dosage of 7 g/l the wine is dry and precise on the finish, with a lasting mineral note that leaves your mouth watering.
",Other White Wines
"Phenomenal. I love these Champagnes. Very pure flavors, with clear Pinot Noir red fruit, and a juicy quality that belies how serious this wine is, and how seriously the Paillards take their vineyards (all massale selections) and their production. One of our favorites, and needless to say, very highly recommended.
",Other White Wines
"This lower dosage, clean and linear Brut is one of the best that we carry, in my opinion. Green apple, bright cherry and lemon meringue notes on the nose. Bright apples, zippy lemon/lime and candied ginger flavors on the palate. It has a finish laden with chalk and minerals. When we have them, do NOT miss the magnums! They priced extremely reasonably and will age for another 10 years. As it is, this little beauty in the 750 ml bottle will age well for 6-7 more years. Do NOT wait to buy any of our Pierre Paillard selections! We receive them in limited quantities and they sell out quickly!
",Other White Wines
"As far as our portfolio of direct imports go, I'm personally a huge fan of everything Fallet Dart has released, and the Grande Selection is definitely one of my all time favorites. If you need a good house champagne, look no further. Grande Selection delivers on so many levels. It's well balanced, the acidity is damn near perfect, and it has a nice toastiness to it like no other. Try it with pizza. Trust me.
",Other White Wines
"As my colleagues have said- this wine is all about the lees. 7 years give this wine an elegance of weight down the mid palate while the Pinot Noir dominance gives a tart fruit character. That small addition of high quality chardonnay brings bright meyer lemon flavor and enough acidity to keep the wine long lived on the palate. I can see this wine being extremely food friendly- a grilled swordfish or a baked chicken would be perfect pairings!
",Other White Wines
"A more subtly rounded Champagne than the Grand Reserve, the Grand Selection from Fallet Dart is blended with mostly red fruit, like the Grand Reserve, but the small about of high quality Chardonnay in the blend makes an impression, and an important distinction. There is also an extra two years on the lees, with a total of six years aging, which creates a slightly funky nose with a clean, bright palate with a hint of toast, and an earthy, chalky quality.
",Other White Wines
"The mere fact that this cuvee from Fallet Dart has a whopping seven years on the lees should immediately grab your attention. That said, it's not all about the lees, you need to start with great base wine. This is absolutely the case for this delicious bottle of Pinot Noir based bubbles made an hour west of Epernay. A bright nose loaded with citric fruits leads to a focused, lively, fresh and engaging palate. Compared to their also tasty Grande Reserve, this wine comes across as drier and slightly lower dosage. Fantastic value for money, and a likely selection for house Champagne at our place. If you are inclined to do the same, it will be super affordable at under $35!
",Other White Wines
"This Champagne hits all of the elements for me that I expect in a great sparkling and is one of the most well balanced I have ever come across, which is incredibly rare at this price. Fallet-Dart is situated in the far western, slightly lesser-known village of Drachy and this wine benefits from being made from only fruit grown on the estate. With up to seven years aging on the lees, this Champagne exhibits fantastic body and depth and the Pinot Noir heavy blend really showcases that varietal. The Chardonnay brings brightness and acidity and rounds of the palate fantastically. Definitely my favorite Fallet-Dart and at this price can be one approachable for any Champagne lover.
",Other White Wines
"The Fallet-Dart Champagnes all represent fantastic values, and there are a number to choose from depending on your preference and budget.  Each on shows a lovely toasty note from their preference for long lees contact.The Grande Selection adds 15% Chardonnay to the cuvee but still has the Pinot Noir/Pinot Meunier dominant.  It shows a bit more of a creamy refined character with  lovely plump white fruits and a tangerine hint on the edges.  It shows a nice bold mouthfeel and a long finish
",Other White Wines
"For those of you excited about varietal character in your Champagne, this is a great wine! Showing plenty of red fruit from the Pinot Noir dominance, this wine is richer, with nutty texture and excellent follow-through on the palate. I generally lean towards Chardonnay-based Champagnes, but this wine might be changing my mind. The elegant Pinot Noir character shows through with such purity and finesse, it easily rivals the elegance of a blanc de blancs. I will definitely be stocking up on these!
",Other White Wines
"I've said it before, and likely will repeat myself many more times, but here goes: white Rioja is where it's at! There is something about the minerality, and acid forward personality of mature Viura vines, that makes it the  perfect aperitive. This particular version is made by Honorio Rubio, who is one of Rioja's most gifted producers of white wines. It is bright, slight savory and salty, with a wonderful texture thanks to six months ageing on the lees.

"I was lucky enough to be invited by Garance Thienot to the Plumed Horse in Saratoga for an incredible Champagne dinner. I hadn't been to this restaurant in more than a decade and the story about it being the biggest fine dining remodel in all of Silicon Valley must be true- it was amazing inside. We started the dinner off with this rich, full bodied, toasty Champagne that still had the snap to make a great aperitif. What a tasty wine!

"This uber-small producer has managed to produce a fine little Brut at a very affordable price. It is composed of 45% chardonnay, 35% pinot noir and 20% pinot meunier with up to 40 reserve wines used in the blend. It has a bright cherry nose with nice citrus notes. On the palate, rich and round and fairly dense with weighty red fruits. Nicely balanced with good acidity.

"This Fino is on the level with the best stuff in the world, and doesn't get nearly the credit it deserves. How do the folks at Valdespino get so much nutty, layered complexity into a wine that is so smashable, refreshing and moreish?

Be careful, the flor ate all of the signals that the wine is strong, leaving nothing but easy to drink deliciousness behind. You have been warned!

"Bollinger sources all their fruit from their 165 acres of Premier or Grand Cru vineyards that are Pinot Noir dominant to create the texture and finesse we have all grown to love from the producer. While 2007 was a more challenging vintage due to early bud bread and cool wet summer conditions, Bollinger's quality standard and impressive, yet time consuming, wine making techniques have created nothing less than an exceptional wine. I find the Pinot Noir fruit character is just starting to cross over to those more developed, earthy tones of reserved champagne. It is bold but bright with lemon zest and baking spice that stay on the palate during the long finish.
",Other White Wines
"Green almond on the nose, with vivid citrus and hints of rounder stonefruit fruit through the palate, this Grande Année feels significantly sharper than the 2005 – thanks  to a cooler 2007 vintage – but keeps the honeyed, vinous character Bollinger does so well.  This is a substantial Champagne with a structured backbone of acidity, while the delicate mousse keeps it lively and elegant. Fresh-drinking for now but with real aging potential, this bright release was a hit at the last customer tasting, and is a worthy addition to any cellar.
",Other White Wines
"It would be hard to do better than to be tasting Bollinger Grande Annee on the job, as part of the job, on a Tuesday afternoon. As it turns out though, I would soon be doing better indeed: Champagne buyer Gary Westby had an extra bottle for the closing crew to enjoy while counting out the drawers that night! Grande Annee is a delicious vintage Champagne, and in the case of this 2007, has what I would call a quiet complexity. Citrus and hazlenut aromas lead to a linear, nuanced palate that slowly reveals additional layers with air. There is plenty to ponder, and  additional complexity that will surely continue to unfold with time. That said, this is not a huge production cuvee, and one of  those luxury products where prestige is comfortably exceeded by the quality (no secret for this wine, by the way) so I would suggest laying claim to some now.
",Other White Wines
"This is a great find right now as very few stores have this wine available for purchase. This Champagne is made from all estate fruit and is fully barrel fermented. The vintage was a unique one, with early bud break, but luckily no frost, though it was cold and wet. Harvest came early though in August, but acidity levels remained high, which has allowed this wine to age beautifully over the last 10 years. It's still showy pretty racy, though it now has some good richness. This would be a great one to pick up and see how it develops over the next 10 years. An absolutely fabulous offering from Bollinger.
",Other White Wines
"As they said on Monty Python, ""and now for something completely different!"" This latest release of Grande Annee is as different from the 2005 vintage as can be. Whereas the 2005 is ""classic"" Bollinger with loads of creaminess, well-rounded oak and toasty notes, the 2007 is restrained with crystal clear acidity. Although dosed higher at 7g/l (the 2005 is 6g/l) this release comes off brighter. The 2007 has a peach and stone fruit character and white floral nose. A long finish with lemon/lime notes in the background and that Bollinger creme caramel.  Bollinger has given us the best of two completely different styles with the 2005 and the 2007 siblings.
",Other White Wines
"The 2007 Grande Annee is classic Bollinger, and reminds me very much of their great 2004. It is composed of 70% Pinot Noir, mostly from Ay and Verzenay and 30% Chardonnay primarily from Avize, Cramant and Oger. I tasted a preview bottle with Denis Bunner and found it lovely, nutty, generous, and toasty on the nose. In the mouth it was full of intense, savory creamy, even nougat like flavors, and the finish had the chalky cut to balance out all of the decadence! If you love great vintage Champagne, this is not to be missed.

"We receive a lot of requests for orange wines and, in my opinion, Skerk is one of the best producers of this genre. It takes a lot of focus and talent to make orange wines with this level of complexity and freshness and Skerk manages to do just that. His Vitovska sees weeks of skin contact and the tannins in the skins prevent oxidation of the wine. It's quite aromatic with notes of tropical fruit and wet stone and powerful on the palate with impressive structure from both tannins and acidity. Whether you are an orange wine fan or interested in trying one for the first time, look no further.

"This is not your typical Txakoli wine here. Grown in a vineyard a few miles more inland, the climate is warmer and allows for the grapes to achieve higher ripeness. This wine thusly rounder than usual, and also does not have as much prototypical fizz. Aromas include saltiness and sea spray accompanied by stone fruit and citrus zest. Slight bit of green and white peppercorn spice on the palate and a chalky minerality. As our Spanish buyer Joe Manekin said it's as if “Txakolina meets Albariño.”
",Other White Wines
"Anyone who has visited San Sebastian and experienced its vibrant dining, drinking and pintxos scene has surely enjoyed the local Getariako Txakolina (""txakoli"" for short) Adur sets itself apart from most of the pack, in that it is relatively opulent 11.5% ABV (compared to the more typical 10.5%!) and shows juicier stone fruit flavors to complement the typical fresh acidity and fizziness.

"This wine was emailed out and a customer came in to ask questions before I was able to try it. As we were deciding between two bottles of wine, I read the description Gary had given us of the Clos Du Mont and started to fall in love then and there! (The customer ended up purchasing this wine) When I was finally able to taste it a few weeks later, my love was confirmed! The high amount of chardonnay has kept this aged vintage blend younger & more vibrant than expected. The barrel fermentation gives the wine it's spice, texture and complexity. Almond paste, fresh apples and apple skins and meyer lemon are a few characters that just scratch the surface of this unique and long coveted wine!
",Other White Wines
"The Fallet Dart ""Clos du Mont"" comes from a very special clos that was partially destroyed in WWI, leaving only one wall. The longstanding history of this clos, which was planted in 740, is reflected in the uniquely complex character of the Champagne, a blend of the 2002 and 1999 vintages, both spectacular vintages in Champagne. The base wines are barrel fermented, imparting a rich flavor and hints of spice. With a beautiful golden hue, aromas of wildflower, red apple and wafts of almond entice. The palate is elegant, with bright acidity and a broad, expansive mouthfeel.
",Other White Wines
"This is one of those Champagnes that helps you to truly understand the history and lasting love affair the world has had with wine from here. From a vineyard that was first planted in 740, this is truly a impressive bottle just for that fact alone. However, that is not what makes this wine compelling, it is in fact what is in the bottle. This blend comprising mostly '99 and the glorious 2002 vintage presents a dustier nose with notes of vanilla that come from barrel fermentation. There is tons of complexity here, layers of dried fruit and balancing acid that lead to a long, lingering finish. This is a bottle that can go toe to toe with some of the best Clos vineyard Champagnes out there but for a fraction of the price.
",Other White Wines
"While I did not think it could get much better than the 2008 Fallet Dart, Gary then proceeded to take us to the Clos. It's phenomenal wine, so bright and persistent, with lovely tangerine like Chardonnay fruit, a slightly nutty quality underlying all that brisk, acid framed fruit. Long lees seems to give great wines like this both a bass layer of deeply burnished nuance as well as the middles and highs of  intense fruit and acidity. One thing I've learned in over 20 years in the wine business, is that if the monks bothered to build a stone wall around it, it's probably a pretty good vineyard--Gary Westby
",Other White Wines
"This bottling presents an amazing steeliness and edge for being composed of wine from the 1999 and 2002 vintages and having been aging in the bottle for as long as it has. Combine this with a barrel fermentation, when Fallet-Dart uses stainless steel on the rest of their sparklings, and you've got a wine that absolutely defied my expectations in a really good way. The Chardonnay in this bottling comes from their Clos du Mont vineyard, which is prized as some of the best fruit in the village and it truly shows through here. An amazingly balanced bottle of Champagne, that not only tastes incredible, but is crafted with years of diligence and care over value for high production.

"80% Chard and 20% Pinot Noir blended to a spectacular luxury cuvee that stopped me in my tracks when I tasted it.

It easily stands its own with those well known luxury Champagnes costing many multiples of this. How can you go wrong!

"This is a wine for true Champagne lovers.  The fruit comes from a site distinguished for its quality by clergy members back in the 8th Century (much like the vastly more expensive Clos du Mesnil).    Aged on the lees for over 12 years, the juice comes from two great, and by now beautifully-aged, vintages: 1999 and 2002, both barrel fermented.  This is very vibrant yet precise, with stone fruit, lemon and tropical notes, a creamy butteriness and rich honey notes.   The finish is incredibly long, with tantalizing minerality.  Unbelievable quality at what amounts to a bargain price.

"On Monday, September 12, I had the rare opportunity to taste the wines of the “the Clos.” This is an interesting blend of the 1999 and 2002 vintages with 80% Chardonnay and 20% Pinot Noir. The wine had a very big nose of caramel, maple leaf and sweet oak. Rich and balanced, with stone fruits and yellow apples. It retained a nice, clean finish with some toastiniess. Kudos to Fallet-Dart to following up well after the Krug Mesnil. A very hard act to follow!

"This comes from a small plot adjacent to the church in Drachy, and has been planted for over 1000 years. The monks of the middle-ages had knowledge of great vineyard sites that we can barely aspire to today, and they never bothered to construct a handmade wall around anything that was short of world class. This clos is now a little worse for wear- it was bombed heavily in World War I and much of the original wall was destroyed. This wine is aged for over 12 years on the lees and is a blend of the great 2002 and 1999 vintages. It is composed of 80% Chardonnay and 20% Pinot Noir. It is the lowest dosage of the line at 5 grams per liter, but because of the long ageing is no less rich than the rest… I would say that it is the richest of the bunch! This is one of the greatest Champagnes that we carry, and while we will never get enough to keep it in stock all the time, it is the kind of wine that will stand on the table next to anything. This is creamy, nougat loaded Champagne that manages to be honeyed and fantastically complex without getting heavy or ponderous. If you are a fan of a fine bead, the extraordinary long sur-lee-ageing given to this wine will impress you with a near perfect texture.

"This spectacular offering from Billecart-Salmon is composed of 60% Pinot Noir and 40% Chardonnay. It is fermented primarily in stainless steel at very cold temperatures to give it the freshness that we all love, but 13% was done in oak for added richness. The dosage is very low, just 5 grams per liter, and just over 4,000 cases were made. The wine has a very creamy Nutella and white fruit nose with a very clean, citric flavor. The NFB has presence on the palate, with plenty of concentration and texture, very long finish that shows off the savor of the top quality Pinot Noir in the blend. This is one of the top wines from the 2002 vintage, and it is great to see the patience of the Billecart family who are releasing this as one of the last 2002s to market. This has great potential for keeping but will not last long in our stocks!

"Okay, they had me at ""100-year-old vines"" and ""volcano"". This has more generously ripe flavors than a basic Soave with lemon curd and honeydew melon up front, transitioning into subtle herbs with a drop of honey. The volcanic ash minerality gains strength with aeration and couples with bright acidity to transition into the finish. This is the style of white wine that really gets my attention and respect with incisive terroir, texture, purity, drinkability, and no need to be propped up with new oak. I have a feeling this would do nicely with some short-term cellaring and add palate weight and really emphasize the mineral underneath its fleshier young profile. It's amazing that this producer's ""premium"" bottling is only $15.99. I hope their wines become a staple here.

"The 2013 Le Battistelle Soave Classico “Roccolo del Durlo” vineyard is a mix of tufo, basalt and clay but is so dark it’s called “Le Carbonare,” referring to the coal-like color it has. Gelmino took me out in this vineyard to show me a whole section of the vineyard that were vines more than 100 years old, incredible to look at but even harder to imagine. The nose is full of sweet quince and Bosc pear aromatics with a cinnamon and baking spice finish. The palate is dense, rich, oily yet so delicate at the same time, that’s the volcanic minerality giving lift, focus and drive to the wine on the palate. Powerful flavors, focused minerality and a decisive, long, lingering finish. 12.5% ABV

"""Roccolo del Durlo"" is a picturesque vineyard comprised of very old vines planted on the hillside of an inactive volcano.

"The whole lineup of Charles Ellner blew us away with complexity and elegance all around.  The Carte d’Or is my favorite of the bottlings. It is a little different from your typical Brut Champagne, they intentionally hold back malolactic fermentation making for a Champagne with loads of character. There are flavors of nuts, minerals and fino sherry, balanced with notes of white nectarine, cranberry and a hint of caramelized apples. This is an incredibly complex Champagne for under $35 a bottle.

"I was skeptical thanks to the wonky label, but I am converted. I even think the label has started to grown on me. Here we have wonderful balance and depth, a sign that the wines in the cuvee are perfectly matured. Indeed, the elevage must have been of the very highest quality. Expect a nose of dense stone fruit (apricot jam) spread next to the finest wildflower honey. A slight breadiness keeps the aromas from feeling too sweet. The palate is perfectly balanced with less sweet flavors and the perfect dose of acidity. Round ripe citrus, complex leesy notes and a lengthy closure. Truly an honor to sell the estate bottlings from this wonderful negoc.

"I was impressed with this Champagne at first sip! This is a classic style with no malolactic fermentation, aged six years on the lees.

"Being a small negociant from what some may call ""the wrong side of the tracks"", here are a few things that Charles Ellner does not do: They don't purchase fruit. The absolutely never do any maloactic fermentation. And they absolutely do not price themselves past what people want out of an everyday champagne. What they DO DO, however, is make insanely elegant sparkling wine that drinks far beyond the modest price. Mostly Chardonnay and a bit of Pinot Noir, this spends an impressive five years on the lees, creating a vibrant and long-lasting complexity reminiscent of the best of sherry wines. Citrus fruit and just a hint of yeasty-dough, this is one to stock up on.

"Charles Ellner is a new Direct Import for us and another excellent reason to shop our Direct Imports over the big houses. The wines we are bringing in from them are all estate fruit and all from Epernay and yet they are all at an amazing price. The Carte d'Or is 75% Chardonnay and 25% Pinot Noir which gives it length and complexity while maintaining a rich golden honeyed note that I personally love. This wine is rich and complex and finishes clean and is so good especially for its price.

"What a great Champagne! This is one of my new favorites in our Direct Import portfolio. When my colleagues and I enjoyed a bottle recently, I was struck with the stunning balance in the wine. Not only does it show plenty of bright, young fruit, but the wine also includes notes of lightly toasted almond, tangerine, and white flowers. All in all a great new addition to our offerings!
",Other White Wines
"This all estate-grown blend of 75% Chardonnay and 25% Pinot Noir is an outstanding value in top-class Champagne. This wine has been aged for over five years on the lees and has a wonderful lemon curd and brioche nose. They never do malolactic at Charles Ellner, and because of that decision they must age the wines longer... The results are spectacular. This has incredible texture and finesse, but also fantastic mineral-laden length!

"The Boveri ""Derthona"" Timorasso is a wonderful Italian white with a rich, almost oily, yet mineral driven palate. This juxtaposition of body and minerality is one of the reasons I have begun to fall in love with Italian whites, and this Timorasso has star quality in that regard. With green, herbaceous aromas, and crisp, bright citrus notes, this is a refreshing and powerful wine that can ease your transition from light Summer whites into the colder months.
",Other White Wines
"Although Walter Massa remains the benchmark for Timorasso, this latest from Luigi Boveri is knockout. Surprising aromas of hazelnut, honey and minerals are only enhanced by a round and creamy textured palate with great acidity and length. We guessed it was over $20 which made this even more impressive. This truly is among the best Italian whites we've added to our cellars of late.
",Other White Wines
"This is white wine for a red wine drinker. There is so much concentration and depth of flavor, intensity, complexity and downright deliciousness here, you'll have a hard time ever sipping on a light quaffing white wine ever again. Made from 100% Timorasso, a rare Piedmontese varietal.
",Other White Wines
"This is a delightful bottle of white that goes well with practically any occasion. Fresh aromatics give way to notes of orchard fruit and mineral tones. Bright crisp acid drives the wine but there is still some texture from the grapes and it all culminates in a clean tart finish. Light and lovely this is a beautiful wine for the end of summer.
",Other White Wines
"Just because my friend Heather Willen's is one of the two ""Minas"" behind this project doesn't mean I'm going to go easy on the wine.  But in this case, it is perfectly justifiable.  The ""Dos Minas"" represents one of the best most correct versions of Torrontes I have tasted in some time.  Capturing the essence of the grape  and it aromas of jasmine, ginger and apples while maintaining crispness is no mean feat.  This is terrific for lovers of aromatic whites, especially if you get a little tired by softer versions.  Great with things like cured salmon, salads of mixed greens and stone fruit or with some salty or creamy cheeses.  Now my aperitif white for warm weathered days.
",Other White Wines
"This is the newest iteration of Brut Rosé from producer Le Brun De Neuville.  The previous non-vintage version consisted of 2/3 Chardonnay and 1/3 Pinot Noir. It now is primarily Chardonnay (~96%), with only ~4% Pinot Noir. Still, the wine evokes light red fruit aromas and accompanying floral notes. A distinct yeast characteristic is exhibited as well. On the palate, the wine is both fresh and savory; possesses a distinct weight that is most likely derived from 5% of oak aging. Elevated acidity as well; nicely crisp. Quite a pleasant Brut Rosé, one that is a great choice on its own or with light food fare.
",Other White Wines
"In general, I don't drink a lot of rose champagnes, but this is one major exception. When we tasted this wine with the staff, I knew there was a big difference here, and hearing more about the wine-making process from Gary, I quickly saw why I was falling in love with this bottle. This is a drier expression of rose champagne, with plenty of rich, red fruit, and lots of texture, weight, and nuttiness from aging on the cork. Its really an ideal food wine, and I can easily see pairing this with main dishes, whether that's poultry, pork, mushroom-based veggie dishes, or anything you might pair a good Pinot with.
",Other White Wines
"I fell instantly in love with LeBrun de Neuville’s “Authentique” Rosé.  The blend, two thirds Chardonnay and one third Pinot Noir, has the best of both worlds: rich and vibrant red fruit flavors along with soft delicate notes of flowers and stone fruit.  The acid keeps the blend energetic and the chalkiness of the Sezanne area it is grown in is undeniable.
",Other White Wines
"I'm a big fan of this relative newcomer to our stable of DI Champagnes, so I was excited to have the opportunity to taste their rose. Containing 67% Chard and 33% Pinot Noir, there is a bit less PN than in the Brut bottling; this wine's color actually comes from a 17% portion of Pinot vinified as red wine. A creamy nose of red cherries leads to delicious flavors and texture on the palate - as much a testament to 3.5 years on the lees and ageing on cork as it is to distinguished, chalky soils and an excellent terroir.
",Other White Wines
"This is everything I like my Brut Rose to be.  Bright red fruits with raspberry and cranberry, chalky minerality and a creamy mouth feel.  The little details of the wine making process add up to a big difference in the way this wine tastes.  The smallest amount of oak barrel aging and allowing the wine to age on a cork versus a crown cap give it a slightly nutty complexity that makes this wine taste like it should cost more than it does.  As they say, the devil is in the details!
",Other White Wines
"Over 2 dozen wine growers come together to combine their knowledge, passion and the fruit of their vineyards to bring us the wines of Le Brun de Neuville.  The Authentique Rose is a wonderful and creamy textured rose, showing beautiful dry red fruits, chalky notes and a long creamy texture.  perhaps the best deal in rose we have, this was a hands down winner for me at our last Champagne tasting!
",Other White Wines
"To be under the ""Authentique"" label from the Le Brun de Neuville, the wine needs to be aged on the cork (instead of bottle cap) for at least 3 years (the rose is 3.5), and to be a majority of Chardonnay. This rose is about 2/3 Chard and 1/3 Pinot Noir. A portion of that Pinot Noir brings us the beautiful pink color and fresh raspberry flavors. The Chardonnay keeps is lifted with notes of citrus zest while a small barrel fermented portion adds a touch of spice and nuttiness. Layered with complexity, the rose screams quality and elegance.
",Other White Wines
"I recently took a bottle of this home, not having tasted it in a couple of years, and I was struck by just how good this offering from our only Direct Import negociant truly is. The long aging on the lees give this wine a natural toastiness while maintaining plenty of bright acid. Notes of baked apple, creme brulee, and lemon zest make this a wine that pairs with food especially well in the fall. An absolutely lovely bottle from our friends at Baron-Fuente.
",Other White Wines
"A prime illustration of what can be achieved in a Champagne with long aging on the lees, in this case seven full years, all to elaborate and define the essence of brioche, hazelnuts and toast that are characteristic of such extended contact. Even more remarkable is the generously modest price for this patient waiting game, a sparkler that expresses ‘’esprit to the core’, with resplendent notes of crisp lemon, bosc pear, cherry and chiffon cream, a sophisticated Champagne created for any and all occasions that involve fine food, the spirit of celebration, friendship and joy.
",Other White Wines
"We just tasted through the line of wines from Baron Fuente, and I must say, they a s good as I can ever remember. The Grand Reserve is a no-brainer for the money as is '06 vintage for $30! But, I really was impressed with the ""Esprit"" with 7 years on the lees for $35. Made from a blend of equal parts Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Pinot Meunier, the Esprit offers a light smoky, toasty note with nutty accents on a rich frame with honey, pear and lemon zest. Wonderful acidity and minerals complement on the palate with grace and fine persistence.
",Other White Wines
"Absolutely gorgeous. Brioch, Tropical fruit, more yeast! Cherries and then cherries! Lemon cream. Mountains of acid and cherries and cream. What a steal.
",Other White Wines
"Aged 7 years on the lees for under $35?  Bring on the celebration! Yeasty nose with hints of caramel and plenty of autolytic characteristics (brioche!), plus chocolate and some dark cherry.  While this is starting to sound more like a pastry than a beautiful bottle of wine, rest assured that these descriptors just mean this elegant Champagne is delicious.
",Other White Wines
"For those Champagne fans who are forever chasing the toasty rich style of Champagne, but lamenting the prices that those styles command, this wine is for you. The Esprit from Baron Fuente spends a very impressive 8 years on the lees, developing all of the brioche-y goodness you can ask for, for a ridiculously inexpensive price tag. Toasty with sourdough toast and almond right out of the glass, the palate evolves into baked phyllo and toasted walnuts. Long and full at the back, with Almond Roca and a freshness of white peppermint that lifts the finish just perfectly.
",Other White Wines
"The Baron Fuente Esprit gets an amazing five years of ageing on the lees. Not many Champagne houses make a non-vintage wine like this, with such a suave texture from long aging, and none at such a low price. This is elegant Champagne for sure; not at all austere, yet in no way sweet, a balanced and fine aperitif. If you want to find out what expensive tasting Champagne is all about, this is a great bottle to try... And it isn't expensive!
",Other White Wines
"Wow, 7 years on the lees!! You really get the rich, deep complexity from that extended sur lie aging in this bubbly. Delicious!
",Other White Wines
"This is one of my favorite direct import Champagnes because it is seamless from start to finish. Very elegant but brilliantly intense as well. Using all stainless steel and spending 7 years on the lees gives the wine its smooth and creamy texture with that nutty brioche and layers of complexity. Triple cream on the nose with pommace fruit on the mid palate and a crisp finish.
",Other White Wines
"Absolutely, delightfully delicious! Medium weight with earthy mushroom, nutty tones. Clean and bright, with a little vanilla flavor finish.

"Fermented in a combination of stainless steel and concrete tanks, this Viura shows just a little rounder and softer on the palate than some of our favorite Viuras from Rioja. That said, it is crisp, refreshing and yellow fruited, with an extra third a bottle built in (the eternal advantage of 1L bottles!) For anyone who appreciates a good value in dry white wine (for drinking and perhaps cooking as well), this has got to be right up there with some of our very best.
",Other White Wines
"A very refreshing, light aromatic wine, perfect for drinking by itself, or would very nicely pair with many light Asian dishes or sushi. I pick up aromas of green apple peel and honeysuckle with faint whiffs of honey and petrol. The wine is delightfully rich on the palate with spiced ripe apricot and nectarine, and cleaned up by a rocky minerality. A very nice wine and a great value.
",Other White Wines
"This entry level Raventos sparkling wine shows off all the pedigree, investment and improvements which the family has been busy with over the past decade. The fact that this is made from 100% estate, biodynamically grown fruit should tell you about their seriousness of intent (and also clue you in to what a great value it is at under $20!) Always bright, mineral, a touch salty even, this is the perfect aperitive, the kind of wine you can just drink and drink. One of my favorite Spanish producers, and certainly at the top of my list for bubbles, Raventos continues to bring their 'A' game to the table amongst their entire range of sparklers.
",Other White Wines
"Lovers of dry sparkling rejoice! This Raventos Brut is crafted sans dosage. As a result, the wine emphasizes the natural characteristic of the delicate fruit and the unique ancient marine fossil deposits of the Raventos terroir. Fresh and light, chalky and bone dry, the wine features very fine bubbles and is aged 18 months on the lees.
",Other White Wines
"This energetic Cava is bursting with spicy quince and tart green apple peel, with a fine mousse and a burst of acidity and minerality mid-palate that catapult to a long and racy finish. The Miquel Pons Cava is a fantastic aperitif for your gathering, and has the heft to accompany most seafood, vegetarian or chicken dishes.
",Other White Wines
"Talk about a deal for the upcoming Holidays! Beautiful orchard fruit on the nose accompanied by notes of lilies and sea spray. On the palate, it checks all the boxes for quality sparkling: clean, ample fruit, and a dry, crisp finish. Notes of red delicious apple and pear play with a light brioche toast and saline qualities. Easily one of the best under-$10 sparkling we are currently offering company-wide

"The best non-vintage of our whole Champagne summit was the Drappier ""Carte d'Or"" Brut Champagne. That is saying a lot, since we tasted so many greats! This combination of 75% Pinot Noir, 15% Meunier and 10% Chardonnay is made with the lowest sulfur counts of any grand marque Champagne. The fruit for this is all from the Aube and Kimmeridgian clay rather than the chalk of the Marne. It is also mostly estate grown. This gives Champagne not only with the lovely red fruit expression one would expect from so much Pinot, but also layers of nearly Chablis like minerality. If you like dry, yet full flavored Champagne, you it to yourself to try the Drappier!
",Other White Wines
"Here's an incredibly well developed NV from Drappier. Slightly nutty signs of older champagne, with yeast brioche and heady dark fruit. Rich and full in the palate, with the dark cherry coming forward and a taught lifted finish. Superb.
",Other White Wines
"A rich, toasty Champagne heavy with stone fruit and lively, tight bubbles. The 80% Pinot Noir shows itself with lively hints of red fruit and spice. Very well balanced with a creamy mid-palate and great length. One heck of a treat for $39.99.
",Other White Wines
"If you enjoy the great white wines of the Rhone Valley and other southern French regions, then put this direct import on your shopping list.  It is full of beautiful tropical and stone fruits: pineapple, nectarines, lemon and mango with a great, rich texture from very limited aging in huge oak foudres and a nice, long finish.
",Other White Wines
"Orchard fruit erupts from the glass with notes of peach, nectarine and yellow plum. A light note of fennel resides in the background. It all comes together with a pinch of baking spice that makes me think of a stone fruit cobbler. This is ripe and ready for spring and summer drinking.
",Other White Wines
"This wine replaced the white star in the US market in the fall of 2009 as Champagne lovers here asked for a drier style. Starting in the summer of 2012 all the Imperial is labeled Brut and the dosage is the same worldwide- 9 grams per liter. They blend four batches of the imperial a year, keeping the winemaking team and bottling lines busy. When I drank this with Moet winemaker Elise Losfelt, she explained that the first blend in January following the harvest uses the most reserve wines- around 30%, while the last blend of the year will use around 20% because of the better maturity of the base vintage. Since they want a fresh style of wine at Moet, they only use one to two year old reserve wines. They age all of the Imperial for 30 months on the lees before release. This was certainly the best Imperial I have drunk, with a discreet nose of bread dough and apple-like Meunier fruit. It was easy to drink, dry and clean and a nice way to start an evening.
",Other White Wines
"This champagne is great and complex on every level. The palette is toasty and loaded with acidic citrus and apple notes. The Charles Ellner NV grande reserve is exceptional to any dinner party, and it's at a great price. Definitely worth checking out, if you love bubbles.
",Other White Wines
"One of my favorite things about Charles Ellner is his use of all estate fruit in his Grand Reserve. A chardonnay heavy sparkling, about 60%, bringing notes of fresh green apple, and dry white stone to the table. The blend of pinot noir keeps it level and rounder on a palate that is carried along by an acidity that won't quit!
",Other White Wines
"The Charles Ellner Grande Reserve Brut spends a minimum of four years on the lees, imparting toasted hazlenut aromas and flavors of spiced dried apricot and golden delicious apple, almond meringue and distinct, insistent minerality. Crafted from all Estate Fruit in Epernay, these bubbles are lively and sensual on the palate, and perfect for any celebration or occasion.
",Other White Wines
"Although Charles Ellner is technically a negociant the wines we carry from the line are all from their estate fruit rather than purchase fruit. Despite this we are able to offer their all estate wines at fantastic prices thanks to DI. Charles Ellner wines all have wonderful rich fruit in them and this Grande Reserve is no exception to this rule. Toasty lemon with rich creamy fruit and enough acid to keep this wine fresh and moving. This is a fun, indulgent little bottle that will please anyone wanting an excuse to celebrate everyday.
",Other White Wines
"This is a rare example of a Champagne that can appeal to any person and style of Champagne drinker. This bottling is made from all estate fruit, with a slightly higher percentage of Chardonnay (60% Chardonnay, 40% Pinot Noir) and spends four years sur lees. All of these elements together, from the higher acidity of the Chardonnay, to the richness and heavier mouthfeel of the lees aging add up to create an extremely well-balanced Champagne. Charles Ellner is a great producer that should be on everyone's radar, whether new to Champagne, or an old pro.
",Other White Wines
"You don't have to give up extreme quality to have a reasonably priced Champagne, Gary's finds over the years have proven that to me,  the Ellner Grand Reserve is yet another example.  All Estate fruit and 4+ years on the lees give you an idea of what they're willing to do to put such quality in this bottle.  It's a great and classic Champagne, lightly oaked with a wonderful ripe green apple fruit and an easy palate feel.  A definite crowd pleaser here, this bottle is very flexible for drinking as an aperitif or perhaps with a grilled halibut steak
",Other White Wines
"On my recent visit to Charles Ellner, I particularly loved the Grande Reserve, a blend of 60% Chardonnay and 40% Pinot Noir from all estate-grown fruit. This non-vintage cuvée is based on 2009 with over a third from older reserves, and has that great balance of power and freshness that really excites me in Champagne. The green apple flavors of a blocked malo bottling were balanced by great brioche flavors—it it had it all!

"From one of our favorite importers of Italian wines, Oliver McCrum, this producer makes wonderfully affordable wines with the quality and authenticity we've come to expect from one of Oliver's selections. The Müller-Thurgau--a Riesling cross created in Switzerland in the 1880s--comes from limestone-rich soils of the Alto Adige. McCrum describes the wine thusly: ""Exuberant aroma of lime peel and flowers; zesty, bright and dry on the palate; delicious as a dry aperitif or with cured meats. I drink a lot of this in warmer weather as an aperitif.""

"There is nothing more exciting for a wine educator than to be introduced to a grape they've never heard of. I was introduced to Timorasso. Our staff tasted 5 wines made by this same producer. All 5 were fantastic, however this is the introductory wine that got me hooked,and made me want to taste the others. This wine had mineral elements to it, a fresh saline nose and savory herbs on the palette. No oak gave it that crispness I adore. I could go on and on but I don't want to be a spoiler. Just try it and see if you don't want to explore more of this grape.
",Other White Wines
"If you find yourself underwhelmed by the lack of variety of white wine grape varietals at restaurants and parties, like myself, and you'd love to try something intriguing; grab a bottle of this Timorasso! It's like many different things but like nothing else at the same time. Interesting tones of fresh cut stone fruits on the nose and you might assume you're into something like viognier or chenin blanc. On the palate the wine offers a nicely weighted structure (like a chardonnay) with a focused mineral spine holding it together (sancerre-like). The finish still offers up much of the stone fruit and minerality experienced to this point in the wine but with a solid hint of spice. I will be taking this home to try with family this weekend! I must explore this Timorasso more!
",Other White Wines
"This wine has stunning floral aromas, accompanied by rich exotic fruit and wild honey notes, which captivate you immediately! On the palate it's off-dry and round with lots of fruit but also with distinctive mineral tone that comes from fossil-rich limestone and marl soil and keeps it fresh and intriguing. Exquisitely complex and beautifully structured wine that comes from one of the oldest vineyards in Alsace dating back to 13th century. I am a fan of it for life now.

"We were very lucky to have Gosset export director Bertrand Verduzier come from Epernay to present his Champagne at the summit this year, and we learned a ton about this very old grand marque. Their flag ship wine is the Gosset ""Grande Réserve"" Brut Champagne, and it is an exceptional wine. The current batch is composed of 43% Chardonnay, 42% Pinot Noir and 15% Meunier with 20% reserves that are blended in the solera style. They never do any malolactic fermentation for this wine, and as such need to age it for a minimum of 4 years on the lees before disgorgement. It has an almost green color in the glass, and has a great tension between opulent toast and chalky, nearly apple like crunch. If you like this Champagne, be sure to put some in the cellar, I have had them going back 30 years and they are spectacular with age as well as young!

"This is not white wine. It's as refreshing, more complex, and has a far more storied past than nearly any white wine I can think of. The wine is Manzanilla, the lightly fortified white wine aged for several years in old oak casks in the seaside town of Sanlucar de Barrameda. Bright, appley, with notes of sea spray and subtle suggestions of almonds, Manzanilla offers quintessential summer drinking, whether it is as an aperitive with snacks, to accompany cheese and charcuterie, or to pair with your favorite grilled, fried or cured seafoods. Give this a try and see what all the renewed interest in Manzanilla and Fino Sherry is all about!
",Other White Wines
"What? A new sherry to try? On it. This manzanilla gives up sea breeze, wet gravel, brine, a gentle toasted almond note and a lemon juice-citric tang on the finish, showing all the character you’d expect and at a reasonable price, too. While this certainly shows where it’s from, there is a softness to the middle that can almost fool you into thinking you’re sipping a brisk, dry white that didn’t mature under a veil of flor. There’s a funny piece of twine on the bottle’s front. I gave it a tug and it came unstuck from the labels holding it in place. Alas, it let loose no confetti. I afterwards ascertained that the name “La Guita” came from a favorite quip of the house’s founder, and was a slang word for “money” but also meant “cord.” Now you know. That they also stamp the bottling date on the back is perhaps the more salient, and appreciated, detail with a perishable item like sherry.

"Not to be confused with the pricier Grand Annee rosé, this limited edition release – sourced  entirely from the stellar 2006 vintage – is special. Aged on the cork and 100% barrel-fermented, it’s leesy and subtly oxidative, with toasty richness, yet also precise with linear minerality. Pinot Noir-driven, it showcases serious berry fruit, a hit of racier orange, and a luxuriously long finish. This powerful Champagne is ready to drink now, and will work beautifully with food.

"This super rich, all barrel fermented Champagne from Bollinger is usually sold as ""La Grande Année"" Rosé for $60 more a bottle. Since the team at Bollinger does not feel that this ripe 2006 will last a generation, they decided to sell it as regular vintage- a first for them. Since it was originally made as ""La Grande Année"" Rosé, this wine it has been aged all the time on the lees on a cork rather than a crown cap. This is a full, toasty, powerful dry style that will thrill fans of this house, at a price that is too good to miss!
",Other White Wines
"It was such a treat to try the '06 rose from Bollinger. Aged on cork, not crown cap, the aromatics fill the nose with gentle spice and saltine cracker. Tart raspberry and that nice toasted spice dance on the palate. And while the wine was barrel fermented for elegance, a soft note of sweet lemon keeps palate elongated and making you go back for more!
",Other White Wines
"When you’re on the market for a rich rosé, how can you go wrong with a barrel fermented gem from the decadent 2006 vintage?  This one from Bollinger is superbly executed, with notes of roses and strawberries, and oxidative richness and toast from the barrel.  Spectacular stuff.

"This superb Rose from Bollinger will not be arriving until this Fall but, I had the opportunity to preview it today, 8 August. It has a super interesting nose of bright strawberry, orange peel and Fino sherry. On the palate, follow-up strawberry, blood orange and almond flavors. Very dry, with fine acidity and very elegant balance. Very bright for a 2006 vintage. Not to highlight the price too much but, this one is exceptional at this level of pricing!

"The delicate straw color of the 2015 ""Genesi"" Vermentino di Gallura is followed by beautiful aromas of almonds, oranges, lemon, honey, apple skins, and a hint of tropical fruits. This crisp, elegant, Full-bodied white has layers of herbs, citrus and a touch of apricot,, with excellent acidity, fresh and long. I love this as an aperitif, or as a broadly useful table wine (roast chicken, fish...).
",Other White Wines
"This is the best Vermentino that I have ever had; in fact I didn’t think Vermentino could be this good at all. The nose is almost surreal, it is just full of dried flowers, dosed with just a hint of salty sea spray, coupled with a  stone fruit compote. On the palate the wine is powerful, yet it has no oak aging, the fruit filled, saline nature combine on your tongue to give a tactile experience in a finish that seems infinite, it carries through the complex fruit character in a full-bodied, un-oaked powerhouse, that lasts minutes in your mouth.
",Other White Wines
"This is one Italian white you don’t want to miss this holiday season.  It is stunning!  On the nose, flowers, bright orange citrus, cream, exotic spice and leesy richness.

"This incredible bottle of Vermentino Di Gallura has the kind of effortless class, seamless texture and near infinite length that one only expects from the most famous white Burgundy producers.

It makes a great drink on its own, but I can't wait to try it with crab risotto!

"The 2009 sings with an opulence that reminds me of a stone fruit crumble.  Toasty spices, hint of nutmeg with notes of white nectarine are all balanced on the framework of lovely acidity and tight bubbles.   This is such a fine bottle of Champagne to drink now and over the next few years.
",Other White Wines
"Another fantastic bottle from Baron Fuente!  The nose starts off with apple butter and poached pears, then gives way to a rich kouign amann pastry, roasted lemon and yeast.  The palate has an intense nuttiness, almost like eating a handful of raw hazelnuts while still providing a clean mineral note and vibrant acidity.  A great bottle to pick up for your next Champagne craving.
",Other White Wines
"In contrast to the zesty 2008, this newly released 2009 is essentially lush with (browned) apple butter, yellow fruits and caramel. While lush on the palate, it does have a nice, clean finish with fine acidity, Meyer lemon and nectarines. Another vintage gem from Baron Fuente!
",Other White Wines
"First and foremost, it's always good to mention that vintage Champagnes are only produced when the harvest warrants it, which usually means you can add an extra $10 -$30 to the bottle cost. Hence, when I see vintage Champagne from a grower who actually owns and farms his own grapes selling for $29.99, my ears perk up. Getting real Champagne of any level of quality for less than $30 today is a rarity as is, let alone vintage Champagne from a grower/producer. So let's talk about the quality: the nose is lively, fresh, and enticing. Citrus notes dance along side brioche and bready notes, and everything about the aromas screams out FUN! When you taste the 2009 Baron Fuente, however, and the clean flavors give way to a nutty, almond skin finish with leesy richness and texture, you begin to wonder just how the Baron family managed to pack this much incredible quality into such an affordable and accessible package. I'm still scratching my head seven bottles later.
",Other White Wines
"A rich, beautiful Champagne! The 2009 was a ripe and therefore accessible vintage for enjoying now. Pretty pie crust, soft spiced pear and apple, and lemon zest with the lightest notes of chalky mineral showing as the wine warms in the glass.

"The lovely, old school toastiness of this Grand Millesime grabbed me from the very first sniff! Baron Fuente has got a real winner from the warm 2009 harvest here, with beurre d'isigny cream and savor, but backed up with more than enough snappy refreshment to keep me coming back for more. This is an excellent aperitif, but will also go very well with gougeres or other finger foods.

"This is one nonvintage brut from a Grand Marque that is well worth the money.  The blend is 40% Chard, 35% Pinot, 25% Meunier and spends nearly 4 years on the lees in stainless steel.  The result is vibrant, pure flavors of apples and pears with an underlying toastiness that accents the fruit.

The Taittinger ""La Francaise"" is a wonderful combination of leesy richness with firm acidity, that glides effortlessly over the palate, hitting all the right notes.

"Elegant with citrusy fruit and a saline edge, the Extra Brut is one of my favorites in Billecart-Salmon’s impressive line up. Exuberant with a superfine bead and gorgeously searing acidity, this still shows creaminess on the palate and a longer – albeit crisp and mineral-driven – finish. Age worthy.

"I love extra brut Champagne, and Antoine Billecart has made a great example of the style with this bottling. He and I drank this along with his team at Quince in SF the last time he was here, and with four years on the lees, it came across as dry, but without a hint of austerity. Many big houses lack respect for Meunier, but not Billecart- this wine gets its charm from the clean fruit that this indigenous grape brings to the blend. It is composed of 40% Meunier, 30% Chardonnay and 30% Pinot Noir and the long, cool fermentation and generous lees time has given this wine the fruit and balance to please even a first time extra brut drinker.

"Bright cherry fruit really comes through on the nose of the Michel Arnould ""Brut Tradition"" half bottle, which lent an almost Northwest vibe when I paired it recently with salmon. Although there is structure and that hallmark hazelnut toastiness unique to Verzenay, this is a refreshing, crowd pleasing option, with a crisp finish.  Clean, but with a richness that almost defies its stainless and enamel aging, Michel Arnould has delivered a creamy, picnic-ready Champagne.  The great price, especially for Grand Cru fruit, makes this little beauty go down even easier.
",Other White Wines
"This is serious vintage Champagne from one of historic houses in Reims. Lanson never allows their wines to go through malolactic fermentation, and this exceptionally young and fresh wine shows what a good call that can be when you have the patience to cellar your Champagne. The nose is full of high quality candied cherry from the top notch Pinot Noir that makes up half the blend and palate is full of Meyer lemon zing from the top notch Chardonnay that makes up the other. The finish is very long and chalky- I can't recommend this highly enough!
",Other White Wines
"Clear lemon fruit on the nose, with a stream of salinity through to the finish, the Michel Arnould Extra Brut is based on the 2010 harvest, a vintage celebrated for creating more linear Champagne. Although this is 100% Pinot Noir and Blanc de blancs is typically the favored suggestion for fish, the Extra Brut is a natural with sushi, especially yellowtail and snapper, which benefits from the sharper acid and low dosage. As a bonus, the Extra Brut's crisp yet easygoing style (it is still a berry-scented Pinot) not only works with food, but as a lively pre-dinner drink if you’re not-so-patiently waiting on delivery.

"This lovely dry extra brut is perfect for ringing in the Spring. The minerality is bracing and magnificent. Lot's of white berries and chalk. Surprising balance despite the overt dryness.
",Other White Wines
"Last night, Cinnamon and I had such a great experinece with our sushi and Chamapgne that I had to write about it. The Arnould started off on the austere side before the first bite of food, but with the sushi it was magic. It did particularly well with the ultra rich Akasaka roll, providing a clean foil to the deep fried tempura shrimp, eel and avocado bonanza. The fish brought out the hazelnut character that makes Champagne from this north facing cru so special and the completely dry finish refreshed the palate with every sip. This is going to be a repeat bottle with sushi for sure!

"A classic and quintessential example of Amontillado sherry from the folks at Valdepsino. Tio Diego has quite an expansive nose, with aromas of bruised yellow apple, green fig, and preserved lemon. Equally as compelling is the bouquet of black walnut, bitter almond, burnt sugar, and oolong tea. On the palate, notes of dried orchard fruit, dried apricot, brazil nut, and toffee. There are both rich and saline notes that make it a perfect accompaniment to various food options. Would be perfect with whole grilled prawns, brick-cooked chicken, or even a Portuguese seafood stew
",Other White Wines
"The best Champagne from Baron Fuente that I have tasted. The Fuente Extra Brut is very dry which allows the mineral flavors to show themselves. It is not austere but bright, clean and fascinating.  It will drink great alone or go well with seafood. I highly recommend this Champagne for people who like a very dry sparkling wine.

"Slightly reduced on first nosing, a calm thoughtful swirl helped that out 100%. Perfect yellow flowers and white meat peaches. Creamy citrus, delicate lively texture, and a perfectly balanced finish. Bligny is blangin'.

"This is composed of half each Chardonnay and Pinot Noir and fermented in stainless steel at the Chateau. It is very clean, but not at all austere; in fact it is quite broad and rich ... A real signature Aube characteristic! It has great texture and body focused with very nice Burgundian style minerality. This will make a great aperitif, but also go well with charcuterie or even a cheese course. The Chateau de Bligny is a big property, one of the largest growers in all of Champagne at 75 acres. They also have one of the few Clos Champenois, a walled vineyard of just 2 acres which they bottle separately.

"If you've read some of my other reviews,  you may have noticed my slight obsession with Meunier dominant champagne. I think the grape adds a little depth and suppleness to such high acid wines, but by no means has the driven, mouthwatering acidity been lost in the fineness of the Rosephile. More than half of the wine is from the tough, yet highly valued 2012 vintage mixed with reserve wine. It is concentrated and complex with an undertone of floral elements that interact ceremoniously with a chalky minerality that sticks to the back palate.
",Other White Wines
"I love how this champagne is Pinot Meunier dominant, as I feel this bottle is a perfect expression of how tasty and greatly fruit forward this grape variety could be in a nice bottle of Champagne. Worth a try, especially if you're a single varietal nerd like myself.

"This is the only pure Meunier rose that we have that has been made by blending red wine with white. About 91% of the base is pressed gently to make the white wine, while 9% is sourced from over 60 year old vines and made as red. The result is a rose Champagne with decadent luxardo cherry flavor, balanced by a precise, fine bead and very good minerality. The finish is dry and long!

"Josep Mitjans, winemaker of Loxarel, is not one to rest on his laurels. One of his more recent creations is Apel, a methode ancestrale sparkling consisting of 100% old vine Xarel-lo, fermented with indigenous yeasts and without any liqueur de tirage or dosage (aka, in both cases, sugar). The resulting wine is nicely dry, perhaps with a softer bead and less savory Mediterranean notes when compared to their flagship Reserva Familiar. I love them both, and expect to go through many bottles of the Apel (as well as many more of Loxarel's other delicious sparklers!) Maybe about seven years ago, I tasted a few of the bubblies from Loxarel at a Spanish wine trade show. Ever since then I have been hooked. I have consumed so many bottles across their dizzying array of products, and built up so much product conviction along the way, that I would put these up against any sparkling wines in the store.

"If you are a fan of Old World bubbly, this should definitely be in your fridge. It comes from Bugey, which is a cool wine growing area in Eastern France with viticultural origins predating the Romans.  Yves Duport runs this small operation with his family, and makes fantastic wines.  The “Origin’L Reserve” has zesty minerality with flavors of stone fruit and baked apples, and a touch of toast from 12 months on the lees.  It’s very clean, crisp and refreshing.  For now, Bugey doesn’t quite command the prices other famous bubbly regions do, making it a killer value.

"This champagne is a real family enterprise, with the Picard family contributing Grand Cru Chardonnay to the blend and the Collard family its famous Pinot Meunier.

"Collard-Picard is a relatively new Champagne house, but with very old ties, which means they are getting a hold of some great fruit and, in turn, are making some great wines!

"A round and full Champagne, with loads of rich fruit. Amazing bubbles, clean and linear. Toasted hazelnuts, sea salt and grapefruit zest on the nose. In the mouth, brown butter, caramel, spice and clean citrus fruit. The finish is where the Chardonnay stands out. Unlike other Pinot Meunier-based Champagnes, this one has the unmistakable minerality of fruit from Mesnil to enhance the zippy finish. I highly recommend this Champagne for those of you who are curious about Meunier-based sparklers. It is also an ideal pairing for fowl and rustic smoked meats where other Champagnes tend to fall flat.
",Other White Wines
"The NV Collard-Picard Cuvee Selection Brut is a blend of 80% pinot meunier and 20% chardonnay. The pinot meunier is from the Collard side of the family, from Olivier’s vineyards in the western Marne Valley. Nobody else in Champagne has such mastery over the native-to-Champagne varietal as the Collard family does. Rene’s vintage champagnes were made only in the best of years and carried on the tradition of the 19th century style of champagne. Several writers refer to those wines as being in the “British” style (truffles, cognac, sherry and caramel), though we have many Americans who shop with us who claim it as their own.

"This release from Pommery is an excellent value. It has the signature creamy and soft style of Pommery and a very affordable price. Peach fruit, cream and a hint of citrus zest on the nose.

"My favorite use for the first Champagne made for rocks is this modified ""Final Word"" cocktail:1 ounce Chartreuse Green 750m1 ounce Luxardo Maraschino Liqueur1 ounce fresh squeezed lime juice2 ounces Moet & Chandon ""Ice Imperial"" ChampagnePrepare a cocktail shaker with plenty of fresh ice, and a large rocks glass with plenty more. Shake the Chartreuse, Luxardo and Lime in the shaker until well chilled. Pour the mixture through a cocktail strainer over the ice in the rocks glass. Top with the Champagne, stir gently and enjoy. As Champagne is less concentrated than gin, it takes a little bit more of it to bring the drink into balance. Since both the lime and the Champagne are acidic, this drink is very bright and refreshing… Perhaps dangerously so! Be careful with these- I thought I was making a more “moderate” drink, but it is easy to get carried away with these!

"The Esprit Blanc de Blancs is made from the very last vineyard in the farthest west part of Champagne—the Chantemanche in Saacy-sur-Marne. This site is one of the very few so far west that they are actually in the Paris district, Ile-de-France. The current release is based on 2009 with 5% barrel fermented reserves from 2008. It is a very creamy style of Blanc de Blancs, with an excellent Chablis like earth character and a bright finish to contrast the richness of the mid-palate.
",Other White Wines
"Another highlight of a recent Blanc De Blanc tasting...The Baron Fuente Esprit BdB doesn't come from where you typically find Chardonnay planted in Champagne (Cote de Blanc)...in fact this property actually lies so far west it's within the Paris district!

"This is a tremendous wine and one that I think fully conveys the thought and the effort that goes into our direct import Champagne program. For the price of a standard grade big house-blended cuvee, you're getting a single vineyard, single varietal expression of incredible beauty and depth. There's a nuttiness on the palate from the extended lees aging (keeping the spent yeast in the bottle) and a crispness that comes from the cool weather in this particular vineyard site. All in all, it's a fascinating bottle with unique spice and character for a price that still comes in less than the entry-level Veuve Clicquot!

"I tried this at K&L Champagne buyer Gary Westby’s suggestion and I’m glad I did.  It’s not every day a wine gives you a veritable “Wow” moment, but this one took me aback.  Bruno Michel has been a pioneer in organic, biodynamic vine growing since the 1980s, and apparently putting prodigious amounts of tender love and care into them makes a stunningly good bottle of bubbly.  Roughly half Meunier, half Chardonnay, the aroma profile is unique and complex: sweet flaky pastry, lemon zest and a hint of cocoa melded together by a rich lees quality.  The acidity doesn’t necessarily stick out, but rather gives the wine the perfect sense of balance, tying together all the rich and complex flavors of quince, toasted pie crust, cloves and baked apples perfectly.   They may not have the marketing power of the “Grand Marques”  but Bruno Michel’s champagnes would stand up to the very best of them in any tasting panel.

"This Champagne is one of the most perfectly balanced bottles I've tried in quite awhile, especially notable with it being such a complex blend of both Chardonnay and Pinot Meunier, as well as various vintages.

"The Bruno Michel wines always deliver, but the ""Blanche"" with 6 years on the lees will surely please. The bouquet shows toasty baked apple with hints of nutmeg spice and ginger.

The finish is so long, complex and persistent you will compare it to bottles costing three to four times as much.  Super quality and super bang for the buck here.

"UPDATE... This recent batch, based on the 2006 vintage, with an incredible 6 years of time on the lees (good luck finding another Champagne for this price with as much lees ageing and overall balance), is damn good. As always the nose is bright, pure and friendly, inviting. On the palate there fruit is bigger and spicier than I recall, but still balanced by fresh acidity due to Bruno Michel's cooler vineyard sites.I have a review from a previous disgorgement below for some context: This is arguably, pound for pound, dollar for dollar, the most versatile and satisfying Champagne in the store. So bright tasting, with good minerality and delicious, juicy fruit. A colleague put it well when she called this champagne ""friendly."" I completely agree. It is indeed friendly, without sacrificing originality or wine geek appeal. One to always have on hand around the house (especially if you're inviting me over!)

"I just tried this wine (again) today (8/5) at a staff tasting and it is magnificent! We have had releases of this over the past several years and this latest one has an ultra-low dosage of under 4 grams per liter. It is a blend of 70% Chardonnay and 30% Pinot Meunier. The Chardonnay comes from vines that are 45 years old and the Pinot Meunier is from vines that are over 70 years old! Despite the low dosage and amazing acidity, this wine is amazingly rich, balanced and elegant. We likened it here to lemon cheesecake! A wonderful effort from a great winemaker!

"As with all Bruno Michel's wines this is very interesting. He works Biodynamically and the wines are generally slightly on the esoteric side. The nose of this wine has an intriguing Pecorino cheese note, a touch of saline character that also shows through on the palate. It has bright green apple and citrus notes wrapped with some more toasty rich hazelnut character showing on the finish. Complex and intriguing, more of a food orientated wine than a simple sipper.

"One of the top wines tasted on my April trip was the 2002 Bruno Michel ""Cuvee Millésime"" Brut Champagne which is a new disgorgement. This current batch has four more years on the lees than the first bottles that we sold, and the dosage has been dropped to 5.6 grams per liter. This wine is so creamy and perfect texturally that it is easy to get carried away with. The honeyed pastry nose has a little hint of vanilla from the barrel vinification, but the chalky drive balances it perfectly. The pineapple like, subtle fruit of this great Champagne remind me so much of Meursault but the mineral finish could only be Champagne. Don’t miss this one.

"2002 may very well be the finest all around vintage in Champagne since the trio of great vintages in the late 1980’s – 1988,1989,1990. Combining lively acidity with dense, powerfully concentrated fruit, the 2002 vintage invites comparisons with the fabled 1990 vintage.The 2002 Bruno Michel ""Cuvee Millésime"" Brut Champagne is a great example of the best of what the vintage has to offer. Tightly wound and complex yet richly textured, this wine is the epitome of restrained opulence. Lightly floral notes of acacia and wet stone give way to sweet, baked apple and cinnamon spice. A hint of brioche graces the very dry finish.While this wine can be enjoyed on its own (if you are in a particularly pensive mood), it will be at its best when paired with food. Try it with roast chicken or sole meunière, or, for a real treat, a bowl of lightly salted, freshly popped popcorn.

"A luxery Champagne at an affordable price. Bruno Michel 2002 is full bodied with layers of wonderful bright flavors. While it has nice fruit, it ends with a nice dry crisp finish. The 2002 Cuvee Millesime drinks very good now but could also be aged for a few more years.

Every time I read my tasting notes for one of these wines, it says something like - Pouilly Fuisse with bubble or in the case of the rose, Gevrey Chambertin with bubbles.

"When tasting this enchanting Champagne at our last staff tasting, the conclusions were, ""definitely a 'geek' wine."" In wine-land, this is a high compliment.  It means that the wine possesses qualities that are uniquely and fascinatingly its own, and that you will be hard-pressed to find something similar.

Encountering wines like this - that enhance one's taste experience, are the reason why I love this business (and this Champagne).

"Le Brun is like one of these culty type producers. He's one of these guys that treats his vines like his children. Probably reads them a story each night before bed and it shows. His entry-level wines are good, but once you cross the threshold into his upper level, it's a whole different story.

"The 2008 vintage for Champagne manifests itself incredibly well with Veuve Cliquot’s millesime rosé. It has an energetic acidity that converges with the ripe red berry notes at a beautifully crafted point of inflection on the back palate. 5% of the wine was aged in giant oak foudres to lend a rich texture undertone with subtle spice notes, and its yeast character is a delicate supplement to the lively fruit.  I would love to revisit this Champagne in five, even 10 years!

The wine has incredible power and a nearly Burgundian savor to it which was very satisfying with the food. It also has the clarity and lift of the highest acid vintage since 1996. This is a wine for the ages... But it will be very difficult to keep my hands off of now!

Up front there are notes of strawberries and cream, raspberry sorbet and fresh baked biscuits, Rose in full bloom. From there, the wine moves into layers of candied rose petals, and fresh picked cherries. The length and persistence of the wine is amazing. Really well done.

"Wow. Mostly from the 2010 vintage (you can tell by inspecting what’s printed on the cork), this is a field blend of indigenous varietals Arbanne and Meslier, plus Pinot Blanc, and is drinking beautifully. Neroli on the nose, more aromatic and complex than just citrus, and riper fruit through the palate, thanks in part to later-ripening Pinot Blanc.  But that orange blossom really comes alive after aging, as Cepages d’Antan is bursting with honeysuckle, white floral, tart lemon, beeswax, and wild honey, plus weighty biscuit notes from a longer time on the lees. The acid is still bright, but what really sets it apart is a slight earthy funk, with interesting rusticity and depth in addition to elegance.  A must try for oenophiles, though even casual Champagne fans will enjoy.

"It may seem like a geeks only Champagne and it definitely fits that requirement with its blend of Arbanne, Meslier and Pinot Blanc but this is not made strictly for the sake of geeky.  Full bodied with more stone fruit flavors, creamy notes.  Long on finish, this a true Tete de Cuvee!
",Other White Wines
"I sometimes feel guilty for impacting the world supply of this tiny production Champagne with my greedy consumption... But never while I am drinking it. The Cepages D'Antan is made from one press load of the near-extinct Champagne varietals Arbanne, Meslier and Pinot Blanc, and yields only about 3,000 bottles per harvest. Nothing is more electric, satisfying and complete than this exotic beauty. This is the perfect gift for the Champagne lover who has ""had it all""... If I leave any behind for them!

"How can you put a price on tasting rare, almost extinct varietals from champagne like Petit Meslier, Arbanne and Pinot Blanc? Especially when they taste as amazing as the Ariston Aspasie Cepages d'Antan! When first popped the nose is quite subtle and delicate. After a little time in the glass, the Pinot Blanc begins to dominate with aromas of white nectarine, star fruit and orange blossoms. With even more time in the glass, the native varietals begin to express themselves with strong notes of chalky minerality and a hint of savory herb. Top this off with a strikingly long finish of limestone chalk and you have a champagne that is unlike anything you'll find on most wine store shelves.

"History in a bottle. I have never had a Champagne made with these grapes, it is truly a walk back in time, and a delicious one at that. I try to find every occasion possible to open this bottle.When the cork is popped this bottle of bubbles is tightly wound, full of chalk and notes of stone and orchard fruit. As is warms up and breaths, the Pinot Blanc starts to shine through, ripe orchard fruits lend weight and depth. A beautiful, almost waxy mouth feel, is balance by an almost saline  line of pure minerality running from start to finish. Completely unique, and absolutely stunning.

"The ""Cepages d'Antan"" from Ariston is a truly special Champagne. True, it is a one-of-a-kind in terms of its rare varietal makeup - 40% Meslier, 40% Arbanne and 20% Pinot Blanc - but there's way more to it than novelty. Aromas of delicate citrus, wet hay, and blossom lift above biscuity undertones. The palate is rich and creamy, with a full mousse, which builds toward a chrystaline finish that is Chablis-like in its chalky persistence. Its power is understated and unexpected; its elegance refined. Though especially awesome with caviar, it has the profile to complement both light and rich foods ranging from delicate to intense flavors. This Champagne will inspire and delight if saved for a special occasion, and will impress any connoisseur if given as a gift this holiday season.

"Wow! I can honestly say that I have never tried a Champagne like this before! I first had it at our Champagne Tent Event in Redwood City and again last week (11/3). A very exotic blend of Pinot Blanc, Meslier and Arbane. White fruits such as pear, lychee and white nectarine. Add toasted pine nuts, some chalk and you have it. One of the most interesting Champagnes in the company. You already love the Rose, now try something very different. Versatile enough to start a meal with or to have with a main course. The Ariston family has done it again!

"My personal favorite of the Baron Fuente offerings at a recent Champagne tasting. Sourced from the estates organically farmed vineyards. I found this to be the most mineral intensive of the bottlings. A crisper, more chalky wine almost like it was more Chardonnay dominant (though I believe it is equal parts Chard, Pinot Noir and Meunier). Aromas and flavors of crunchy orchard fruit, dry bread, cracked wheat, chalk and flint. A nice savory, nutty component too. Dry and mouthwatering. Great value for Champagne of this quality.
",Other White Wines
"This 100% organic Champagne is a knockout and would be a bargain at twice the price.  A super expressive nose of wedding cake and buttered toast explodes from this sparkler and with air begins to hint at dark fruit.  The mid-palate is rich, ripe and frothy showcasing more dark fruit and ends with mineral drive on the long, intense finish.
",Other White Wines
"All estate fruit and Biodynamic, this creamy beauty spends 4 years on the lees and the bottle we tried showed soft texture with almost dulce de leche qualities and a bright, orangey mid-palate. Bargain-priced and easy drinking, this should become a go-to for the organic set.
",Other White Wines
"Baron Fuente has long been one of our best values in Champagne--with their  entry-level bottling coming in at a mere $23.99 it is hard to beat. However, after tasting the Galipettes today, I happily realized that they have some serious offerings in their lineup. This bottling is all estate fruit and completely organic, something that few negociants offer, the nose is dripping with wild cherry, fragrant cassis and a touch of chalk. The wine flows out of the glass with a mineral and red-fruited palate, red fruits abound, cherry, currant, and just a hint of exotic spice lingering in the back. Clean and fresh on the finish, this really impressed upon tasting.
",Other White Wines
"Wonderful all-estate fruit with a 1/3 blend of each of Pinot Meunier, Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. Biodynamic. Rich with cherry fruit, cocoa and bread dough accents. Crisp at the back of the palate. An upcoming feature Champagne for February!

"Simply gorgeous. Elegant pear, citrus, honey and cream. Easy, nuanced, delicate Champagne. Well done, M.DeMarville!
",Other White Wines
"The wine is gorgeous, and very understated. Whereas the Veuve Clicquot ""yellow label"" Brut is all about upfront flavor and fruit, the Grande Dame series is entirely subtle and nuanced. The aromas are quite light, with hints of white flowers and fine, flaky pie crust, the fruit, though from the ripe year of 2006 is restrained, but pretty, and the structure has tons of integrity. I am very much impressed with the way this wine is drinking now, and believe it will only improve with age.
",Other White Wines
"A big surprise! Much more minerality than expected. Cream, golden apples, smoke and almonds on the nose. Big, toasty and mouth filling, though not as big as many other 2006 vintage champagnes. Fleshy mid-palate with golden fruit and dark cherries. Very clean finish. The Chardonnay dominates on the nose, while the Pinot Noir dominates on the palate. More geared toward brightness than the past few vintages.
",Other White Wines
"This is one of the most elegant, subtle, and delicate bottles in our Champagne section. Crafted entirely from Grand Cru vineyards, this great Champagne could not be further from the mass market style. It is a jewel for the jaded palate, and I can't get enough of its laid back, creamy, detailed style. I had this most recently with a warm Napa Cabbage salad, and it worked perfectly, cooling and refreshing my palate after every savory, bacon loaded bite. It is composed of 53% Pinot Noir and 47% Chardonnay and has class and length to spare!
",Other White Wines
"Replete with dried fig and date as much as salty, almond nuttiness, there is also something distinctly umami here that doesn’t neatly slot into any easy descriptor. The salty component is high in the mix here—you won’t find many wines that taste drier that aren’t powdered—before it finishes meaty and just a little tarry. Seems like this Amontillado took an extra degree before graduating. Neat take on the style!
",Other White Wines
"Amazing, layered, and just plain ol' delicious! This sherry is a show-stopper. It is almost entirely dry, except for a hint of sweetness at the finish. In my opinion, the bit of sugar helps to give the wine life, balance and a smooth seductiveness...this is almost too easy to drink, so be careful. The racy acids and soft delicate flesh of the grapes used to make the wine show at the starting gate across the palate. This gives it a more than gracious length and lingering finish of beautiful almond skin and roasted pecans (this flavor will go on for minutes and minutes after taking a sip!). It is always a great time when I get to enjoy this amazing sherry with family and friends...the way it should be drunk. Happy drinkin'!

"Cinnamon and I drank this last night with an English cheese course of Stilton, Cotswold and cheddar, reliving our first trip to London together. On that trip, we had made a pilgrimage to Neal's Yard Dairy in the old city and bought a similar cheese course to pair with the very first bottle of Gonzalez Byass Matusalem that we had ever tried. Since then, we have been lucky enough to drink it on many occasions, but last night was one of the best. This sherry has a dark mahogany color and the perfume of a wine of a great age. The rich figgy flavors are countered by cheddar like piquancy that made the pairing perfect. The finish is very focused and driven, with rancio notes as well as pure chalky minerality. This wine is plenty sweet, but I will never tire of it, it is dangerously refreshing!

"Marie Chauffray of Domaine Reserve d'O relishes the opportunity to create signature wines of great charm, finesse and brilliance. Her artisanal talents are very much on display in this unique, declassified white wine, made from co-harvested, co-fermented Chenin Blanc, Roussanne and Grenache Blanc. Unoaked, fresh-fruited and utterly distinctive, with floral and citrus aromas and a roundelay of rich yellow and stone fruits, embroidered with lovely acidity. A rich tapestry of  a wine, and a tribute to a woman who unerringly follows her own path through the vineyards and beyond.

"We try a lot of wine as a part of our work here at K&L (it's a tough job but somebody's gotta do it!).  When I taste a wine that is so completely unique and full of personality, such as this little gem, I have to stop and sing its praises.  Marie Chauffray and her husband Frederic are wine shop owners turned vintners.  Marie is part of a consortium of female winemakers called the vinifilles, a group of women who own and operate their estates touching every part of the process from the growing to the label design.  They are Ecocert Organic and Demeter Biodynamic certified and even print their wine labels on recycled paper.  This is natural winemaking at it's finest.  Smelling the wine reminded me of eating a melon salad with mint and some sort of floral honey.  It's fresh, enticing and interesting.  It's on the fuller side but carries enough acid to prevent it from feeling too heavy.  As we like to say, ""so much wine, so little time"", but I'm glad I found this one sooner rather than later.

"When was the last time you've had Chenin Blanc from the Languedoc? I'd venture to guess never. There's almost none grown in this region, but I'm surprised there isn't more after tasting this Chenin-based blend. It has an incredibly distinct aromatic profile with citrus, floral, and herbal notes. Big and round on the palate with a nice zap of acidity, and totally distinct from its counterparts in the Loire or South Africa. A seriously distinct and tasty wine.

"My love for and exploration of Greek wine continues!  This is an amazing wine from the island of Crete.  The southern most point in Europe, Crete is a wholly unique terrior lending the wines an abundance of character.  From a third generation winemaker, I found this wine to be intensely floral with honeysuckle leading the charge.  It's waxy and has notes of stone fruit and pineapple, with wet stone minerality.  It's round but bright on the palate, and sees 18 months on its lees.  This is just an incredible wine from what I suspect will be the next ""it"" wine producing region.
",Other White Wines
"There's so much to appreciate from a well made white wine that's not expensive. The Dafnios stands out from the crowd like a lovely Montrachet. Beautifully textured, lovely tropical notes, with nutmeg, allspice, and a dash of cloves. Crisp acidity, great minerality, and a gorgeous mouthfeel, make this a bottle to purchase by the case! Incredible!
",Other White Wines
"A bottle of Pata De Gallina and a plate of Cotswold, Cheddar and Stilton lead me into predation every time. I pour a big glass, put the bottle back in the cellar and close the door; otherwise I will be powerless against its charms and pour another. Then I go back to the cellar... It is the tang and zip of this bone dry wine that make it so moreish, while the scale, richness and complexity make it beguiling. What a wine!

"After tasting the Roeder Estate Anderson Valley Brut Sparkling Wine, it’s hard to believe that it is a domestic sparkling and that it only costs $21.99! What sets this domestic sparkling apart from the rest is how dry it tastes. I always have a problem with how high the dosage levels are in domestic sparkling wines but not with the Roederer Estate Brut. The nose is bright and lively with fresh pear, tangerine and clean bread yeast notes. And while the palate is friendly and accessible with riper pome fruit and clean melon flavors, this domestic brut finishes precise and focused.

"Champagne is always best out of magnum! Of all the grand marques, no one offers a cleaner, purer example of Champagne fruit and refreshment than Billecart-Salmon. The Billecart family pick earlier than most, and run the coldest, longest fermentations in all of Champagne to deliver their inimitable, graceful house style. If you are looking for the ultimate in balance aperitif Champagne, you have found it!
",Other White Wines
"This is great Champagne- and perhaps one of the best values for money in any category of wine. Louis Roederer has been pushing quality like few others in the region over the last decade, and no wine shows the heights that they have reached as well as the Brut Premier. With massive investment in organic viticulture, including a massive purchase of 1er vineyards from Leclerc-Briant, a return to plowing in the vineyard instead of chemical treatment and obsession with every detail in the winery they have created something here that has no rival among the big names, especially at this price. The 1/3 of the fruit that they buy comes from growers like Benoit Marguet- so you know they are getting top stuff. While most of my time is spent advocating for single origin Champagnes, this bottle is a great argument for blending and the balance that cellar master Jean-Baptiste Lecaillon created here is second to none. This wine has a great brioche nose and plenty of vivacious sparkle. It is a perfect aperitif!

"The Lopez de Heredia whites of Portugal? While we are not yet intimately familiar with this Portuguese producer, we did have the opportunity to taste this white, produced from 100% Arinto grapes, and were impressed by how well it has aged. With a similar bright citric acidity and old time gracefulness to the texture, this is something that we are very excited about.

"Emblematis, which can translate as ""symbolic"", to Trudon expresses the house's ""historical style"" while featuring 70% Meunier that thrives from the Festigny soils. 60% of the wine is from the difficult yet concentrated vintage of 2012 while the rest of the wine is a reserve blend. The wine is driven with mouthwatering acidity mixed with a finesse of floral undertones and is held on the back palate with chalky minerality. The wine surprisingly went through 90% malolactic fermentation, which adds to the elegance of the wine but doesn't distract from it's longevity. An award winning champagne at an award winning price!
",Other White Wines
"Our latest direct import from the Marne is true to the style of the region, with Meunier dominating the blend followed by Pinot Noir.  This Blanc de Noir showcases real exoticism and spice, with pear, apple and cherry flavors and a rich, decadent texture.  The finish just stays and stays.  Another sub-$30 Champagne miracle from our direct import program.
",Other White Wines
"During our recent Champagne tasting, we were discussing the Pinot Meunier grape - its unique personality, versatility, ability to make a delicious wine on its own and even its contribution of savory richness to the Krug house style. Well, we have a new Meunier based Champagne (70% PM, 30% PN) from Trudon, and it is delicious - a fantastic example of the power and tastiness of this grape variety.  Juicy, subtly spicy and refreshing, Trudon Emblematis reminds me of Michel Loriot Brut Reserve, whose bottles I have nearly depleted in my cellar over the past couple years. I will surely be replacing them with Trudon. Delicious, and affordable, Champagne!
",Other White Wines
"Our most exciting new value in Champagne is here, the Emblematis from Jerome Trudon. With more than three years of ageing on the lees, this all estate blend of 70% Meunier and 30% Pinot Noir should be more expensive... Luckily we buy direct and the dollar is strong! This wine has 50% reserves from older vintages and features subtle baguette toast and exotic yet elegant fruit on the nose and in the mouth. Since Jerome does not use malolactic, this wine has great focus and a finish that I would only expect from a wine costing 50% more!

"Edi Keber lives in Friuli, in Collio just scant meters from the Slovenian border and produces one wine made from Friulano, Ribolla Gialla and Malvasia Istriana This wine has the richness of California Chard-onnay and the finesse of White Burgundy, layers of fruit, spice, and mineral drive the incrediblepalate presence and you to a heightened frenzy. Capable of aging for a decade or more but ready now, it’s perfect for meatier fish like swordfish, halibut or even lobster. You’ll love the smooth, rich texture and the delicate aromatics.
",Other White Wines
"Keber is a legend in Collio. The wines are always delicious. The nose is a monsterous bouquet of musky angelica, fresh anis seed, pithy tangerine and a subtle savory white pepper. The intense bouquet doesn't interfere with the incredibly delineated palate showing tons of juicy acidity and a fabulous creamy citrus. It finishes long and dry with the savory herbs poking back out at the end. Totally in love here.
",Other White Wines
"The Keber family has resided in Italy's Collio region near the Slovenian border for generations. Today, Edi and his son organically farm the local white grape varietals Friulano, Malvasia Istriana and Ribolla Gialla and blend them together to make a single wine. Their 2015 Bianco is truly impressive. An aromatic array of gooseberry, citrus and herbs is nearly upstaged by a round, spicy and mouthwatering palate with delicious hints of anise and tarragon on the long finish. It's not only a tribute to their talented winemaking but also a shining example in a top vintage.

"A true Manzanilla with a bouquet full of oysters, clams and salted toffee.  A flavor intense palate of oceanic salt and seaweed, peanut butter, bitter almonds and squash. Impeccable quality, a crazy value. What a steal!!!

"Manzanilla Sherry delivers so much pleasure for so little money... With the La Cigarrera Manzanilla Sanlucar De Barrameda it might be too much! Cinnamon and I cracked this little half bottle last night for the aperitif and enjoyed some Marcona almonds with rosemary with it. Before we knew it, that half bottle was in the recycling bin! This bone dry, electric Manzanilla has a nose of marzipan and sea air that took my mind back to Andalusia. This light, delicate bottle was way too easy to drink!
",Other White Wines
"Gwah!  Great Manzanilla for nothing at all.  If you don't like sherry then we can't be friends, but if you at least try this bottle I'll forgive you forever.  An accurate example of this stupendous style of sherry.  Intense and nutty, very very rich with a racy balancing acidity.  This is what I LIKE!!!
",Other White Wines
"This manzanilla plays down the toasted almond dimension of sherry, and offers instead clean, vibrant, salty aromas coupled with golden apple and a little sprinkling of parsley, even. Take a sip, and you’ll find a smooth texture and a pleasantly plump middle palate, finishing with a citric pucker and a lingering evocation of wet stone. Well worth trying where you’d normally reach for muscadet, say.
",Other White Wines
"I don't drink a lot of rose wine or champagnes but this was a delightful surprise. Just enough cherry and strawberry notes to give this wine a freshness without being overly sweet. One touch to the lips and your mind thinks of the fantastic pairing possibilities from savory a amuse-bouche to sweet desserts.
",Other White Wines
"100% pinot noir with no malolactic fermentation. Strawberry and raspberry nose with toasty notes and jammy scents. On the palate, Morello cherries, a touch of cranberry,  ample structure, and a racy finish. Lovely as an aperttif or with white meats such as chicken or pork.
",Other White Wines
"These bubbles are derived from 100% Pinot Noir and emit wonderful fragrances of cassis, wild strawberries and a tinge of minerals.  Upon entry, this sparkler is crisp and light, while continuing to show a tenacious amount of strawberries, red fruit and toast.  Enjoy these bubbles with a grilled pork loin, a sunset and good company!

"This all Pinot Noir Champagne is one of our very best rosés at any price. It is made by maceration, with 100% of the skins in contact with 100% of the juice and entirely from organically grown, estate fruit in Noe Les Mallets near Troyes. While many rosé Champagnes made in this style are dark and heavy tasting, this wine is bright, full of subtle red fruit and vivacious refreshment. Cinnamon and I enjoyed this with Chinese scallion pancakes (Cong You Bing) and it was a fantastic pairing!
",Other White Wines
"Wow, not sure what is impertinent about this wine, it's spectacular and lovely.  A wonderfully red fruit nose and a richer elegance on the palate, dry with a long finish.  And for a rosé at this price it is a serious price performer.
",Other White Wines
"Another new Champagne to love! Tons of dark cherry fruit leaps from the glass in this barrel fermented beauty. Very expressive, with both a lushness in the mouth and that classic bright acid zing!
",Other White Wines
"The dominant character here is a subdued toasted nuttiness, not specifically almond or walnut, with undercurrents of dried fruit. The palate is another thing altogether. This is one a wine that succeeds more on texture than nuance of flavor. While it is a sweet wine, it doesn’t put itself across the way a sauterne or even a sweet sherry would. It is as though you’d put the proverbial “spoon full of sugar” in your mouth-though for the purposes of this analogy we’d better make sure you’re visualizing raw sugar-and then sucked a fat wedge of lime. The tremendous acidity doesn’t just balance out the sweetness, but actually overcompensates for it, making it seem to finish much drier than it started and lip-smacking, too. Singular stuff. Works pretty nice with a slice of pumpkin pie and I’d wager you would get good mileage out of it with well-seasoned meaty bites, say dumplings of some sort.
",Other White Wines
"The magnum of the Charles Heidsieck Brut Reserve is even better than the Champagne in .750 which is truly a statement.  The .750 is rich and opulent but the magnum lends yet another overlaying note of refined elegance to the package.  It is often repeated that Champagne is best made in magnums, and this bottle is definitely an argument to that truth.
",Other White Wines
"When I started working for K&L and was introduced to real Champagne I was told that it tastes better from a 1.5 Litre than any other size. Today I was able to reinforce that by tasting the Heidsieck magnum next to the 750 ml and the 375 ml. While I enjoyed all three bottlings the magnum was the clear winner. Smoke and rich fruit in the nose was balanced by clean acid. Notes of golden baked apple and hints of tart green apple make this one of the large house Champagne producers definitely worth getting into.
",Other White Wines
"It is no surprise that at 10 years old, many of the 2006 Champagnes are really starting to show well. The best I tasted at this year’s staff summit was the 2006 Pol Roger ""Extra Cuvée de Réserve"" Brut. This is one of the most masculine, vinous, broad and powerful Champagnes of the day. It is composed of about 60% Pinot Noir to 40% Chardonnay, but that Pinot is powerful Mountain of Reims Grand and 1er cru stuff… And it shows! I loved the big, hazelnut and black cherry savor in this rich, yet very dry Champagne. This will be a top recommendation for anyone married in 2006 or with a child born in this year, because while it drinks well now, it will be great for a long, long time.

"From the southern French region of the Languedoc comes this beautiful example of Cremant de Limoux, very characteristic of the variety, with perfume of white flower, citrus, lemon soda and drying mineral tones.

"A wonderful example of a brut rose, this bottling is slightly fuller than some others, with a subtle hint of spice on the back palate. Lovely!

"This is not a casual sipping rosé! On various occasions, I have enjoyed this and have it come across as rich and satisfying, or brooding and spicy, on one occasion I think I recall my tasting notes saying ""good 1er cru Nuit-St-Georges with bubbles."" However you describe it, you cannot argue against this being an intensely flavored, highly original Champagne with real personality.
",Other White Wines
"Every time I taste this Champagne, I want to sit and linger with it for the rest of the afternoon. It's a totally nerdy rose, unlike anything else we have. Barrel fermented, all Pinot Meunier and aged in bottle for a year, this particular bottling is all from 2006 fruit. Red cherry, spice, vanilla, leather, funky earth with medium plus acidity and a long finish. What a fabulous, fun rose Champagne!
",Other White Wines
"The Bruno Michel Les Roses will speak to red wine lovers.  The characteristics are so similar to a Pinot Noir such as ripe cherry, orange peel, earth and spice.  This has the stuffing to pair with many foods.  While this is not a Champagne for every palate, it is a special treat for some of us!
",Other White Wines
"This was the most controversial (and also one of the best selling) Champagnes at our recent pre-Valentine's day tasting. One taster described it as tasting like shoe leather, and many others described it as savory and the best of the day. It might be my favorite rose Champagne in our stock and pairs perfectly with cedar plank salmon and no more than one other person... Unless you have extra bottles! Deep, intense and very red wine like in flavor you need to be ready for it before opening it!

"One of the most unique Champagnes that I have tasted. And one of the best. The Bruno Michel Les Rose is made from 100% Pinot Meunier and is full bodied and dry, with a nice red color and lively bubbles. This Champagne will go great with salmon or fowl and is produced to accompany food.

"A standout rosé from a boutique producer who is delivering everything and more for the most experienced Champagne afficianado to the novice taster. At K&L's Champagne tent event this year, this rosé stood out far beyond the rest of the competition. On the nose fresh strawberry and toast, followed by a rich yet delicate mid-palate and a finish of perfection! The grasping fresh fruit quality is insane without being overwhelming. The finesse and elegance of this French beauty is even more mind boggling. Enjoy this before the word gets out!

"A high yield and high quality vintage with crisp and focused characteristics. The 2004 champagnes are just starting to find their stride and the '04 LP has found its. Filled with blossoming aromatics of lemon, lime and white floral notes, it is vintage like the old days- long, cool and wet. The acidity is leaner and longer on the palate while the mix of mature and fresh orchard fruit interact with a subtle toasted almond note keeping the wine polished and textured.

"I love when back-vintages of Champagne show up in our warehouse, all aged and more ready-to-drink than ever! This Grand Cru charmer from 2004, a classic vintage in every right, is in a beautiful spot right now.   It is displaying beautiful chalkiness, meyer lemon notes, pear and a very subtle, intriguing toast.  This is a delicate and subtle bottle of bubbles, worthy of a discerning palate.
",Other White Wines
"More '04, please! This cool vintage, described as ""classic"" among Champagne growers and negociants, will rarely disappoint, particularly for fans of acidity, ageability and wines that lead with finesse and balance as opposed to richness, toast and power.

",Other White Wines
"Another great bottle of Vintage Champagne from the wonderfully classic vintage that is 2004. Lively and lifted, this wine possesses a vibrancy that carries it from stem to stern. Pithy and fresh on the entry, lemon cake and sweet almond, a touch of Meyer lemon zest as well to add verve. The palate has a rich lees quality to add balance and depth, more shortbread than brioche. Minerality and lift carry the day though, fresh and clean, lovely vintage offering.
",Other White Wines
"I have been telling everyone who will listen that the 2004 vintage in Champagne is one not to miss. The region used to get ""classic"" vintages like this twice a decade, seasons that offered even weather, cool conditions and produced wines that are streamlined, bright and mineral. Not anymore... A vintage like 2004 has not come along since 1988, and there have been none since. This LP has all of the virtues of the vintage; spectacular length, elegance and lift, as well as the toasty richness that one expects from a long-aged vintage bottle from a great house. Don't miss this!

"We got a huge laugh of the frivolity of drinking this Champagne in ice filled goblets with cucumber after closing the store last night. It was the opposite of the  intellectually engaged, notebooks out studiousness of most of our tasting here at K&L. Best of all, the wine tasted good. I had recently been by the Niyija Market in Mountain View and bought some very nice Japanese cucumbers, so I packed up my cutting board and my Nakiri to prep them after closing. I put two thin slices at the bottom of each goblet, loaded the goblets with ice, poured in the Champagne, through another cucumber slice in and decorated the rim with one more. That was all there was to it!

"Adding a new grape to my repertoire, Catarratto is a white grape planted mostly in Sicily. It is often used as a blending grape in Etna Biancos, but here we see it in full force. While it has the snap, structure and salinity we all know and love from Sicilian whites, the grape brings in a broad texture of yellow pears and ripe peaches. A little scent of clove on the nose is a delightful mystery as the wine was aged in cement tanks.
",Other White Wines
"Just like in real estate wine is location, location, location… I wouldn’t have thought much of a Cattaratto coming from this part of Sicily but when I tasted Porta del Vento I was stunned, 2,000 feet of elevation can do a lot. The nose of this wine is superb, layers of ripe pear, spiced with just a bit of earth and garrigue that just pours from your glass. On the palate the wine has weight, density and a real supple richness that is brought to focus by a superb acidity and finishing minerality. The wine has structure, it’s got shoulders it’s powerful but no hint of any wood this wine has grown out of the ground structure, a real wine.  The finish is wonderfully exuberant, full of super refreshing, ripe Bartlett pear that goes on and on, sensational wine. Pair this wine with a meatier fish like shark, swordfish or even Halibut.
",Other White Wines
"This wonderful expression of the often maligned catarratto grape is going to change peoples minds about the whole varietal. The perfect balance between aromatic depth (pithy exotic citrus peel) and mineral intensity (flinty rocks being smashed together). In the mouth it's dense but not flabby at all, an acidic counterpoint allowing it to remain refreshing and open. More flinty rocks, soft yellow fruits and tiny touches of fresh herbs. This is a pretty serious little wine for the price.
",Other White Wines
"Admittedly I like to drink white wines that have a fair amount of acidity and thus I've come across only a handful of Catarattos over the years that I've liked as most have lacked a level of freshness and vibrancy I prefer. That's not to say that many were not high quality, well made wines but rather that I've encountered only a few like Porta del Vento. This wonderful find offers intriguing scents of pear, flint and stone fruit along with great acidity on the palate. One of my colleagues mentioned it lands somewhere between a Chablis and an aged Vouvray Sec and I'd have to agree. A real find from Sicily.

"This Champagne comes from the impossibly steep slopes of Ay grand cru in the heart of the Marne Valley. It is composed of 2/3 Pinot Noir and 1/3 Chardonnay from some of the chalkiest soil in all of Champagne. While this vintage proved challenging for many, some of the best plots in the grand crus did exceptionally well, producing wines of both power and finesse. This is one of those wines, and has plenty of richness for drinking on its own, but also the backbone of minerality to pair with the best salmon or tuna fillets.

"Madeira has been relegated to the shelves of cooks for years, but the Rare Wine Co. is changing that with it's phenomenal line of Historically significant single variety Madeiras.  This shows intense fresh cotton candy, freshly cracked almond and a deep earthy rancio fruit on the nose.  The palate EXPLODES with acidity negating any sweetness that might have been there.  Because of the ridiculous way they make Madeira, this basically has no shelf life, so open it today and drink over the next year!

The fruit in the nose of this wine is so pure, clean and vibrant it outgrows the appellation, the wine has so much minerality, clean focus yet still retains that Prosecco elegance and balance. Sensational finish!
",Other White Wines
"This is a wine of great balance and elegance and an excellent aperitif for all social occasions. A must have this holiday season, for yourself and if guests drop by.On the nose you will find generous fruit, releasing hints of apples, peaches and tropical fruit, plus wisteria blossoms, wonderful balance and elegance complement a pleasurably spiciness. The Palate is velvety, crisp, and fruity, admirable fullness and length, closely mirroring the nose.

"This non-vintage Champagne shows excellent equilibrium between minerality, toastiness, and citric fruit with no single characteristic outshining the rest. Certainly a fine bead and excellent texture from a magnum. Complete and very pleasurable.

"Creamy with a bright apple nose and solid minerality, this is classic Verzenay: qualities of hazelnut and cherry shine through, with a richness that almost defies its stainless and enamel aging. The great price makes this beauty go down even easier - a perfect party-pleasing Champagne.

"This is a fantastic non-vintage bottling from Michel Arnould. The blend consists of a heavy dose of Pinot Noir (75%) and the rest Chardonnay, which creates a wonderfully delicate and floral nose that leads into heaps of red fruit and red berries. The finish is clean and citric. A truly special bottle of bubbles.
",Other White Wines
"This is a blend of 75% Pinot Noir and 25% Chardonnay, entirely from estate vineyards in the Grand Cru of Verzenay. It is a great party Champagne, since it is full of flavor yet refreshing and moreish. The hazelnut Pinot character so unique to the village of Verzenay is pronounced in this wine, and many good tasters have mistaken it for barrel-fermented (it is actually all stainless and enamel fermented) when presented the wine blind. The texture is full and the bead is refined -- a Champagne that you will be proud to serve to your guests, or perhaps not too proud to save for yourself! If you have enjoyed the wines of Lallement, Bollinger and Krug in the past, I think you will very much enjoy Michel Arnould. They are bold, masculine Champagnes with plenty of toasty flavor.
",Other White Wines
"Wow, out of magnum this Champagne is even more of a powerhouse. Extended time on the lees has imbued this Champagne with layers of richness and complexity that are intensified out of the magnum format, leaving a sensational palate impression.  Rich, creamy aromas and flavors wrap around a solid structure of fruit, coating the mouth with toasty goodness. Showing impressive volume and cut, this is a truly regal Champagne with the structure and complexity to complement a variety of foods.

"I had the honor of enjoying this champagne with Alexandre LeBrun himself over sushi after a recent in-store tasting he provided for our customers.  It was incredible!  The unique profile created by the Pinot Meunier can’t really be overstated:  Persimmons, quince and a slight toastiness are rounded out to perfection by a modest dosage.  This is a special wine that would highlight a special occasion excellently!
",Other White Wines
"If you are a fan of Meunier based Champagne, trying this is a must. The Revelation is composed entirely of Meunier from vineyards of fifty years or older, only 1200 bottles of this incredible wine were made. The vines for this Champagne are in the very cool micro-climate of Monthelon, just south of Epernay, and thus have a far racier character than any of our other Meunier’s that come from the Western Valley of the Marne. With quince like fruit, subtle brioche and ample mineral drive, this serious wine has a finish that lasts like a blanc de blancs. It is dry at only four grams per liter of dosage, but not austere. A classic!

"If you're new to Georgian wines like I am, this is a fantastic introduction to one of the oldest wine making traditions in the world.  Doqi is a collaboration between German born Burkhard Schuchmann & third generation Georgian winemaker Georgi Dakishrili.  Doqi is one of three labels the duo produces and it combines traditional Georgian qvevri and Western style wine making techniques.  Although the Mtsvane in this wine is fermented and aged in stainless steel, the history and tradition of the region is felt when tasting the wine.  Produced in Georgia's most important viticulture region Kakheti, which produces three quarters of the country's wine grapes and has a unique soil called ""Cinnamonic"", consisting of sandy, iron rich calcareous clay said to bring a depth of flavor and a rustic, earthy note.  The wine does possess an earthy florality, almost like a Gerber daisy.  It's crisp and dry with notes of freshly sliced fennel, Seville orange, green apples and green almond.  If you're looking to try something new, pick this up and give it a go, it's interesting and delicious.

"This wine is amazing, if the nose alone doesn’t get you the balance will. These grapes come from and island off the south coast of Sicily where these vines are grown in terraces cascading down to the sea, all head trained vines, the work is back breaking to care for and harvest the fruit. The nose is hypnotic, a wild blend of middle eastern spices, with dried mango, ginger, honey, lime peel, grapefruit it’s got everything. On the palate the wine has density it just flows across your tongue, like waves of spice lapping up on shore. So complex, so well balanced it doesn’t come across as sticky, it’s just superbly balanced. A long finish, more and more flavors emerge, this is something to behold.
",Other White Wines
"Rich, flavorful, and extraordinarily unique! Tons of warming toast on the palate that combines perfectly with the lifted fruit aromas and tastes of bruised pear and baked apples. The finish is long and energetic, providing a smooth swell of slight nuttiness. A memorable go-to for the serious wine drinker looking for richness.
",Other White Wines
"Here's a very unique, complex and rich Champagne that any Champagne lover needs to try.  Powerful with rich hazelnut, exotic fruits and spice box notes, lovely citrus peel and a layer of beautiful sweet chalky minerality.  The long ageing in a solera style adds to the unusual complexity and intrigue of this Champagne.  All this at an unbelievable price for the quality.
",Other White Wines
"Bright green apple shines on the nose, followed by more exotic fruit through the richer palate. There is a subtle sherry quality to this complex Champagne, but despite that lush feel, the finish is snappy and quite dry, with pleasing chalkiness. Coutelas’ delicious ""Cuvée Louis Victor"" always sells out quickly, and given the price for such a well-made offering, I can see why.
",Other White Wines
"This Champagne, made using a sort of solera-style fractional blending, deserves a good amount of contemplation.  It is incredibly precise and delicate with light citrus, apple, exotic fruits, and a hint of herbs with chalky minerality.  But its method of production adds notes that are new to me in the realm of Champagne.  It has almost a fine indigenous-yeast sherry note to it that I love!  I now understand why this Champagne sells out so quickly every time we get it in stock.
",Other White Wines
"This bottling is a blend of 2007 through 2012 vintages with three years of ageing on the lees. It is a brassy gold color and has a generous nose of fresh forest aromas and brioche toast. In the mouth it has a round, rich, seamless texture and an amazing array of flavors… It is easily one of the most complex Champagnes that we have on the shelf. The truly amazing thing to me is the focus of the wine. It stays completely refreshing, vibrant and mineral on the long finish, which makes the 750ml format seem to small! This Champagne is produced out of one 8000 liter barrel and every year about 100 cases is bottled, and the barrel is refreshed with the best wine of the next harvest.
",Other White Wines
"This champagne is very good company. Endlessly complex, revealing different dimensions with each sip. Starting its savory story when the glass is full and cold, all the way until the final delicious drop, a bit warmer and with some of the bubbles subdued. An absolute STEAL for the price - and a must-try for all champagne lovers.
",Other White Wines
"A blend of Chard, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier, what makes this Champagne unique is that the wine comes from a single 6,000 liter foudre, which is fractionally blended so that in includes more vintages than your typical NV Champagne. Interestingly earthy on the nose, the palate is rich, with flavors of apples and, maybe this is just the power of suggestion given the fractional blending (which is sort of like a one barrel version of a solera) but it has some very gentle oxidative and Manzanilla like notes. A great value Champagne for those looking for great quality and originality.
",Other White Wines
"This multivintage blend which includes harvests from 2007 through 2012 is a must try for those who like their bubbly on the rich side but without giving up any complexity.  This is chock-full of red fruit and berry flavors and there is an additional layer of maturity provided by the inclusion of the older stocks.  This is produced using the solera system (as in sherry) and there is nothing else quite like it.
",Other White Wines
"This FANTASTIC release of the Cuvee Louis Victor from Damien and Angelique Coutelas is based on the 2012 harvest with vintages from 2007 on up blended in. It has a wonderful butterscotch nose and is rich but, not sweet on the palate. It has a creamy texture and brioche and golden apples notes. Simply delicious! It has a lingers and very lovely finish. This is the best champagne that I have tasted in recent weeks.
",Other White Wines
"A very interesting concept in Champagne and one that delivers quality and flavor-wise beyond the unique approach. This wine is basically a single vessel ""solera"" where each year 100 cases worth of wine are removed from the large oak barrel and then an equal amount of vin clair is added back. Current disgorgement is 2007-2012 base. The wine has tons of pure, juicy fruit, lovely floral high notes and great richness on the palate. The finish is defined by taught acidity and good chalky structure. A wine with real presence and persistence on the palate.

"Ribolla Gialla enjoys a long history as one of Friuli's oldest indigenous vines, this extremely unusual wine would be worth buying solely on account of its very low price, but once you have tried this unusual grape varietals, you be back for more. The palate is intense and full with a supple body, echoing the wine's varietals character, exotic and honeyed bliss, floral notes, hints of flint and citrus, delivering several complex layers that transform as they evolve in the glass, the finish is dry with lots of acidity and pleasantly fresh.

"As much as we enjoy this wine every vintage, the 2015 is even bolder. It's medium-bodied with a wonderful texture, crisp acidity and soft citrus notes that make it perfect not only as an aperitif but also with light soups, white and cured meats. Break out the prosciutto!

"Ribolla Gialla is an indigenous grape variety that usually shows a more energetic acidity, and because of that is often used in sparkling wines, but in this vintage it really sings. This is fragrant, with a citric crispness, and a wonderful shellfish wine.

"For fans of the Sadie wines (like myself), consider this blend of white varietals a similar pleasure at a very reasonable price. The textural richness from the South African chenin blanc is on full display here with flinty, rocky, and stony flavors permeating that core from the terroir of the heavy granite soils. There's still plenty of lift from the acidity on the finish, which is simply wonderful. White wine enthusiasts like myself need to be drinking more white blends from South Africa--period. This wine is exhibit A.

"The Charles de Gaulle might be the best deal in top notch grand marque Champagne at K&L. It is composed of 80% Pinot Noir and 20% Chardonnay and is one of the most leesy, layered powerhouses in the building. If you like wines like the Bollinger vintage and the Pol Roger Winston Churchill, you should definitely try this Champagne. I found it to be very complex, with hazelnut, fine toast and Kimmeridgian minerality all in great balance. The texture and bead are as good as it gets. This is the first batch of this wine that is non-vintage, the last vintage dated Charles de Gaulle was the 2006. I am guessing that this is based on 2007 with reserves, but I don’t know for sure.

"This white Rioja from Contino surprises. A blend of predominantly Viura (80%), along with a touch of Garnacha Blanca (15%) and Malvasia (5%).  A fresh, bright nose with aromas of yellow stone fruit, citrus zest, and lemon curd. A noted toasty bouquet as well, adding another layer of richness and complexity. Mouthwatering acidity on the palate, with distinct mineral qualities. Ripe fruit comes through; quite well-balanced. Reminiscent of a white Burgundy, but more fresh and bright in overall expression

"I took this home on a whim without realizing it was a demi-sec and opened it one night after bringing home a fried chicken sandwich topped with spicy wasabi coleslaw.  Now, some people may scoff at a demi-sec Champagne but if anyone can do it right, it's the house of Roederer.  After the first sip I immediately realized that I hadn't brought home a Brut, but was pleasantly surprised (and pretty happy) that of all nights, I decided to open this on a spicy fried chicken sandwich night!  Fried chicken and Champagne is already one of those mystical high-low pairings that works like magic, but factor in a little residual sugar and spice...whoa Nelly.  The wine is soft, still has some lift from a vein of acidity and elegant all at once.  The fruit is ripe and creamy and it all manages to avoid being cloyingly sweet, despite the fact it's dosed at 38gm/L.  If there ever was a balanced demi-sec, this would be it.

"This Grenache Blanc is a great example of a white wine which not only has beautiful aromatics, but great complexity and depth on the palate. The heady, floral aromas of this lovely wine give way to soft orchard fruits such as pear and white peach on the palate. It's kept lively by a finish of crisp citrus-loaded acidity. The whole flows very seamlessly together, keeping a coherent line of elegance from start to finish.
",Other White Wines
"Grenache Blanc is the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde of grape varieties.  It is at once big, rich, and full-bodied but also bright and crisp with high acid.  It's a grape that has the potential to make really exciting wines, but more often than not I am underwhelmed by Grenache Blanc.  It usually tastes to me like winemakers push it to be just one thing (big) or the other (acidic), and the result is sadly devoid of personality.  I'll be the first to admit that I expected a Grenache Blanc from Paso Robles to reaffirm my blasé impression of this grape, but luckily I was very wrong about that.  Utilizing wild yeast fermentation, all stainless steel, and a minimalist approach to winemaking, Mark Adams of Ledge has embraced the antithetical nature of this variety, and the result is an impressive range of  aromas and flavors including Meyer lemon, jasmine, fennel, saline, and white peach.  At last a juicy, lush, zesty, and delicious example that has restored my faith in Grenache Blanc.

"Champagne Charles Ellner is one of the largest vineyard holders in Epernay, and wine comes exclusively from these vines. It is composed of 50% Pinot Noir, 30%Chardonnay and 20% Meunier, is aged for almost five years on the lees and is treated to an addition of 1/3 reserve wines. This has great red cherry Pinot Noir fruit framed by baguette toast from the long ageing, as well as surprising snap and length. This is an ideal aperitif, and will go fantastically well with gougers, parmesan crisps and all manner of finger foods.

"While the 2007 growing season brought some stress, the 2006 season allowed the winemakers to put their feet up. An almost effortless growing season with plenty of sunshine and minimum rain. This vintage is more ripe and fruit forward than some of the other LP's in our line up. Filled with notes of yellow pears the wine relaxes on your palate before a slight lift of citrus pops open on the finish.

"The most meticulously prepared of all of the presentations at this years big staff summit was Champagne Laurent-Perrier, and after the tasting and talk I was left with a new appreciation for the history and commitment to quality at this great house in Tours-sur-Marne. I loved the 2006 Laurent-Perrier Brut Champagne for its laid back balance and excellent texture. It is composed of half each Chardonnay and Pinot Noir entirely from Grand Cru sites and aged for eight years on the lees. If you like your Champagne with a great balance between Meyer lemon zing and creamy richness, this has it all.

"Cruz Vieja makes some of the most intricate, complex wines of the region, with such attention to detail and care for every step of the process. This Amontillado is elegant and complexly layered with flavor.  It is extremely aromatic, revealing notes of hazelnuts, white flowers and bitter cocoa with flavors of salt, honey, roasted almonds and a long finish.  Food pairings are endless with this wine, anything from olives to artichokes, to cured meats, to even heavier meats like pork or lamb.

"The 2004 Blanc de Blancs combines all Grand Cru fruit from three villages and ages this spectacular Chardonnay in 30% old French oak barrels, and the result is stunning. Allegedly the winemaker’s favorite cuvée, this is deliciously chalky, evolving with each sip, and while it would easily please a sophisticated crowd, it might be a better fit for more esoteric palates looking for something powerful and artistic. This is both high concept and richly enjoyable, bright with sharp acid, and beautifully leesy with a brioche finish. I’d drink this in a bigger wine glass and be happy all night.
",Other White Wines
"A wine like this, a true work of art showing its full potential after so many years, is inspiring.  It’s made from Chardonnay from all three Grand Crus of the Côte des Blancs, partially aged in barriques for depth and complexity, then aged on the lees for 9 years.  It displays those rich Grand Cru fruit aromas (pear, stone fruit, figs) with a well integrated toasty-brioche character and honey.  The flavors complement each other perfectly on the palate, craftily balanced by a youthful acidity.  This is a beautiful wine that’s ready to be enjoyed and contemplated.

"My favorite vintage Champagne of our 2016 staff summit was the 2004 Billecart-Salmon Brut Blanc de Blancs Champagne. It epitomized the ideal of elegance in wine, and had a creamy ease and subtle restraint that would leave even the most jaded of palates asking for another glass. The incredible fruit sources in the Grand Cru’s of Chouilly, Mesnil and Avize and the natural balance of the classic 2004 vintage undoubtedly contributed top quality ingredients, but the cold fermentations and judicious use of top quality cooperage at Billecart delivered the wine… This is a bottle I hope to drink again soon.

"On Monday, September 12, I had the rare opportunity to taste the wines of the “the Clos.” This wine had a wonderful nose of lemon meringue, toasted nuts and freshly whipped cream. On the palate, it is extremely unique with lemony zest, mandarin orange, kiwi and a little nutmeg. The finish is super, super clean with lime fruit and chalky notes. Two hours later, it was all about toasted nuts and citrus! So, very, very Krug.

"If there is a single Portuguese region that consistently brings great value to the table, and is unfortunately as consistently overlooked, it would have to be the Dao. There are great wines at a variety of price points, though this under $20 white is one of my current favorites. It features Encruzado, the region's star grape and a variety that can bring to mind Chablis, Muscadet, Godello for the Iberian inclined imbibers out there. Citrus - particularly ripe pink grapefruit - on the nose, leads to a palate of pure fruit, with nice extract and phenolic qualities as well. Organically farmed, raised in neutral oaked, further cultivated by a sound system streaming in live opera from the Met for crying out softly...this is a wine well worth experiencing!

"All of LP's vintage champagnes are 50% Chardonnay. 50% Pinot Noir and always all Grand Cru fruit. 2007 had a lot of champagne houses pacing with an extremely warm spring and early bud break, but luckily enough, the season was frost free! Early harvest kept the grapes nice and acidic while having a creamy suppleness on the nose. A chalky base to the wine adds contrast to the softness on palate and touch of savory earth for dynamics brings this wine up another notch.

"This ten year old vintage offering from one of my favorite Grand Marques is drinking great!

"With 150 years of history producing many indigenous grapes of Sicily the Di Giovanna family excels in depicting the true local essence of Grillo.  Organically farmed to pay respect to the culture and hardy island spirit, the wine remains bright and fresh with lemon drop highlights and a clean mineral note.  Rich when it hits the palate, a full viscous mouth feel conjures lime zest on a chalky structure. This local style has been perfected over time and we are sure through many family dinners.

"Unimaginable! Unfathomable! Ridiculous! What has me so puzzled, you may ask? The fact that the wonderful folks over at Ariston Aspasie could surpass the quality and value of their ""Carte Blanche"" bottling. Incredibly, that is exactly what they did with the release of ""PRESTIGE"". Sourced entirely from the wonderful 2008 vintage, here we have a slightly richer and more dense wine than its slight-lower-priced cousin. Highlighted by both apple and zesty citrus notes, the main attraction here is the weight! This is serious, serious champagne that should age beautifully while also over-delivering here in the present.

"A study in the power and minerality that can only come from the old vines of Champagne.  The Cuvee Prestige from Ariston is a pure expression of what the flavor profile of vines that have been growing in the deep chalk soils for many years. Dry and precise, notes of wet stone and a saline purity electrifies the palate on entry. The body is weighty and focused, driven, taking your taste buds for a ride with lime zest and Granny Smith apple, as well as a hint of spice box lingering in the back. Amazing with food, it almost demands it. Cured meats, cheese, cedar plank salmon.

"The wines of Paul-Vincent Ariston were the first from Champagne to be imported directly by K&L some 15 years ago now, and the Ariston Aspasie Prestige Vielles Vignes is still one of the best values on our shelves. The current cuvee, though not vintage dated, is composed entirely of fruit from the exceptional 2008 vintage (certainly the best vintage in Champagne since 1996, and perhaps even surpassing that much-heralded year). A blend of all three principal varieties (Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Pinot Meunier) from 65 year old vines, the old vine character really shines through here, yielding a wine of surpassing concentration and depth. This is one to savor, or perhaps to cellar for a few years. You can congratulate yourself on your foresight in the years to come.

"Perhaps one of the best kept secrets in the store for white wine.  The textural refinement combined with refreshing, vibrant fruit and acidity make for a complete and delicious wine that stands out at nearly every tasting we've had.  And not just telling the folks next to me that I enjoyed it, but folks from all three stores rallying to this wine because they had the same enthusiastic ""we need to get the word out"" type reaction.

"Dollar for dollar, for my money, this is the best white wine we have. Old vine Viura, complemented with heirloom varieties such as Malvasia and Calagraño, fermented and aged in Stockinger foudres for 18+ months, mineral as all get out yet also rich in the mid-palate with the length of a (very good) $40 white Burgundy. This stuff is fantastic. Proprietor/vigneron Bryan MacDonald's star is on the rise, and I would suggest that now is the time to get acquainted with this spectacular white wine. Load up for drinking now and for your cellar if you've got the room; this wine will age.
",Other White Wines
"This white Rioja is strikingly unique. Mostly a blend of Viura (~90%) with the remaining 10% being composed of a field blend of Malvasia, Garnacha Blanca, and Calagraño. Initially, it struck me as being quite reminiscent of White Burgundy. Aromas of stone fruit and pear upfront, with a bouquet of white florals and minerality.  Yellow orchard fruit and white peach on the palate with lively acidity. Subtly rich and quite balanced. Drinking as if it was a $40 bottle, a truly great deal for under $20
",Other White Wines
"I'm not sure how to express this sentiment without seeming hyperbolic, but here goes. Simply put, this is among the best K&L direct import white wines I've ever tasted in my ten year career with the company. Not only does this viura wine (viura is the white varietal in Rioja) deliver textural richness, minerality, complexity, and fineness of flavor, it does it all for a price that I can't seem to wrap my head around. Pound for pound, I would put this wine up with some of the $40 St. Aubin chardonnay wines we see from Burgundy and some of the leesier Chablis wines from Grand Cru sites. It's a shocking wine, one that tastes at least double the price, if not triple. There is a simple grace to the Laventura, one that finishes with layers of soft stone fruit, mineral notes, and the absolute perfect balance of acidity. It's the kind of wine I would buy cases of cases of, while continuing to sell cases and cases to my best customers. Ultimately, I'm someone who get's more excited about a great deal than a great wine. In this case, you're getting both. Dollar for dollar, I'm not sure we've ever carried a better white wine for the price. My highest possible recommendation.
",Other White Wines
"New Wave Rioja producer, Laventura are making energetic, fresh and terroir-driven wines that are worth paying attention to.

"Lots of textural interest here for Sherry fans. This is a Palo Cortado that lives up to its name, combining the elegance of an Amontillado with some of the richness and the flavor signature of an Oloroso. Walnut, in a very dry, woodsy fashion, caramel, leather and raisin all make their appearance here. The finish is more austere, focused and dry than most true Olorosos would display; it never picks up the full sweetness and weight. Roast nuts and hard or blue cheeses play real nice with this.

"The value that Patrick Arnould delivers with this top-notch rosé is mind boggling. This is the only rosé Champagne that I have ever had that is exclusively Pinot Noir, but made by blending wines that are vinified white with wines that are vinified red. Patrick is very proud of his Burgundian clones in his best exposed vineyard plot that he uses to make the red wine that gives this Champagne its color and flavor. This rosé has dark cherry authority as well as complex savor from that high quality vineyard. It also has easy refreshment and a dry chalky finish from the rest of his Grand Cru estate vineyard that makes the white Pinot portion. A must try for every rosé fan!

"This is the best vintage of Veuve Clicquot I have yet tasted. Monsieur DeMarville is beginning to experiment with a small amount of barrel fermentation, and the merits of this are clearly seen in this 2008 wine. The vintage itself lends a rich, weightier feel to the wine, balanced out nicely against bright, citrus-focused acidity and a hint of nicely integrated autolytic character. One of the most pronounced features of the 2008 Clicquot is the variety and complexity of spice notes that weave from the nose through to the palate. In this wine Monsieur DeMarville has certainly reached greater heights, and I look forward to his future offerings.

"This vintage marks the first time that VC has used oak-aged wines for this blend. In this case, five percent. The clean nose leads to rich apple and creaminess. Freshness comes through on the palate with minerals and chalk. The mid-palate retains golden/yellow fruits and toasted almonds. Intriguingly long and bright finish. The final blend is 61% pinot noir, 34% chardonnay and 5% pinot meunier. Don't miss this one!

"I couldn’t be more excited about the 2008 vintage in Champagne, especially when Dominique Demarville, the Chef du Cave at Veuve Clicquot agrees with me! The vintage offers the perfect balance of ripeness and acidity, and is no more evident than in the newest Gold Label offerings. This bottle is full of pie crust and golden pears, hits of clotted cream add a luxurious texture. The mouth feel is soft and warmly textured, but what sets it above any other vintage bottling is the vibrant acidity that lifts the entire wine from stem to stern. Vibrancy and richness in tandem make this wine eminently enjoyable now, but it will also be one of the longest lived bottles of Gold Label in a long time.
",Other White Wines
"This is one of the best examples of the great 2008 vintage in Champagne that I have yet to taste. While many people only think of Clicquot for their yellow label (it is after all the number one selling Champagne in the USA!) I have always found the Gold Label to be not only their best wine, but one of the great Champagnes of the world. This might be the best young one that I have ever tasted, and has all of the features of a legend in the making. It is composed of 61% Pinot Noir, 34% Chardonnay and 5% Meunier sourced exclusively from Grand and 1er Cru vineyards. This is the first vintage with Dominique DeMarville at the helm, and he has integrated 5% of large would foudres into the otherwise stainless steel fermentation. This is a bottle that has it all- big, nutty, dark cherry power from powerful Pinot Noir and incredible chalky drive and a near endless finish from classy Chardonnay. It is impossible to have too much of this in the cellar- it is not only fabulous now, but will improve for as long as you can keep your hands off of it!

"The Rey Fernando de Castilla Palo Cortado is over 30 years of average age with both tremendous aromatics and flavors.  Aromas of cocoa, roasted chestnuts, tiramisu, and nutmeg beam from the glass.  The palate is bright at first, showing it’s years aged under flor with a beautifully tangy acidity, lemon rind and burnt orange peel.  The palate turns to flavors of almonds, mocha and espresso on the finish.  Potentially the finest example of Palo Cortado that exists. A must try bottle for Sherry lovers. Oh and properly stored, this bottle will keep well once opened for a couple of months.

"Super yummy white at a silly good price. This wine opened with a beautiful ripe nose of big orchard fruit and goes into a cool rich mid palate with a touch of salt and sandy minerality. Easily one of the most fun whites in this price range in the store right now in my opinion.

"Love, love, love this producer's wines! Somehow we have made it through a large portion of the summer without the 2016 bottling of this fantastic Vinho Verde blend, but if it's any consolation, our real summer here in the SF Bay Area doesn't kick into high gear until September anyhow. Softly textured yellow fruited, slightly frothy as opposed to aggressively fizzy, this Alvarinho and Trajadura blend is delicious and really hits the spot. Highly recommended.

"This toasty, beautiful P2 is a big step from the 1998. I am very impressed by the generosity and balance of this Dom, as well as the incredible freshness given the extended ageing. I tasted this with Vincent Chaperon this March, one of the winemakers, at the Abbey of Hautvillers where Dom Perignon himself worked. I am very excited that it is now here for you!

"A new bottling for me, Quinta do Regueiro's Alvarinho stands out as one of the best Portuguese white wines I have tasted so far this year. Based a short distance from Melgaço, Alvarinho from here can be every bit the equal of the best Spanish Albarinos from the other side of the Minho River. Showing bright, juicy tangerine flavors, perfectly balanced acidity and impressive length, there is a lot to like here....

"If there is one white wine, in any price range, in our inventory now that takes home top honors in my book, it is this wine! Yes, I know it's not cheap by most white wine standards, and yes, the word Timorasso is somewhat reminiscent of Arrested Development's pretend psychiatric drug, Teamocil. Ironically enough Teamocil is a contraction of the Spanish words 'te amo' 'cil', which translate roughly, into ""I love you easily"". This wine, is so easy to love, that this translation is not lost on me. The aromatics offer a beautiful fruit, and herb tone. Almost perfumed. On the palate comes such a rich, round, textured style of white wine that it's easy to compare it to Burgundy wines twice its price. As with Walter Massa's other wines, this has beautiful minerality, as well as mouth watering acidity. This is definitely a wine to be savored, not rushed. Drinking beautifully now but I'd be seriously curious of how this will express itself in five or ten years.

"Roberto Rossellini and Ingrid Bergman… I never thought I could start a review with that line. This  white wine is from the island of Salina, one of the Aeolian Islands off the north coast of Sicily. Stromboli, a famous name thanks to the 1950 movie that Roberto Rossellini directed and Ingrid Bergman starred in (their romantic offspring, actress Isabella Rossellini was spawned during the filming), is one of the other islands in the small chain of Aeolian Islands. When I first saw this wine I sighed. I knew that Malvasia on a label was the kiss of death, because everyone in America will assume the wine is sweet. Yet from the first sniff of this wine’s heavenly aromatics I knew I had to buy it. Labeling is an issue for us retailers. I can see customers’ eyes glaze over at poorly made labels or unpronounceable names. With this wine, once you taste it I won’t worry. The nose is incredible, full of a briny, salty, floral character, spicy and inviting, so intriguing I helplessly reached for a fork. The 2015 Caravaglio Malvasia Bianco Secca Salina, Sicily is actually DRY, yes; it is dry Malvasia and you are going to fall in love with it just as I did. The wine is fermented dry in stainless steel tanks and then bottled. On the palate the wine has a supple, richness, a weight that shows presence but not heaviness or fat, just a level of importance. Once there on your tongue it just takes over your palate, driving, intense, and linear and begging for a plate of Spaghetti con Vongole (clams). This wine is really unusual in the fact that it is sourced from 20 different small vineyards all over Salina that are planted with the Malvasia delle Lipari grape.

"This grape is becoming very popular in the San Francisco bay area, thanks to a little restaurant called ""A16"", that has introduced a lot of Southern Italian varietals to its patrons. A bright, fresh wine with pear, lime, lemon peel, toasted hazelnut with a mineral/salty notes on the palate, this is a very food friendly wine.

"Always a good choice. If  you have tried this, you know the truthfulness of this statement.

"While many people expect a sweet dessert style Malvasia when coming from Sicily, this wine steps away form the norm in great direction. The tropical fruit is accompanied by rounded weight and is complimented by salty minerality from start to finish.  The nose reminds me of a dry Riesling, full of juicy fruit and floral characteristics. Long lived and easy to love white.

"I just re-tasted this on Labor Day and it was showing extremely well. In fact, our entire staff loved it! This is a main course Brut Rose in the league of Bruno Michel and Fleury. A big style, with full and lush red fruits and savory spices and blood orange. Some smokiness and a complex finish. Will hold up to red meat and smoked game meats.

"This deeply colored rose Champagne is one of the most painstakingly selected and made in our stock. Almost all of the fruit comes from the Viller Deniere parcel, one of the most limestone rich sites in Gye-sur-Seine. The fruit is then sorted so only grapes with healthy skins are used for the Audace. All of this fruit is then macerated with all of the juice for about 18 hours, but the extra color from this special plot still yields a lot of color, but without too much tannin. This results in a rose with shockingly pure Pinot Noir fruit, with great richness and power!

"I wasn't aware of German varietal Elbling until I tried this bottle, and let me tell you, I was in for a treat. Clean, slight mineral notes, and well balanced acidity, this 1L bottle is probably the best bang for your buck around. Perfect choice for any summer wine party, and pairs brilliantly with oysters.
",Other White Wines
"A great surprise for me as I don't recall ever drinking ""Elbling"" - Reminiscent of a Gruner on the nose, but on the palate, it has this most attractive saline note. Quite dry but with a welcoming vinous texture. Acidity is high, but balanced. This is an easy, nice wine that is very useful in many settings, from summer get-togethers, to a seafood dinner extravaganza!
",Other White Wines
"THE ultimate summer sipper. The Elbling grape was once a staple of theGerman wine industry. Now the variety onlyaccounts for 0.6% of the nation’s plantings.And yet this bottle is potentially the mostcrushable wine of 2017—so far. It clocks in at10.5% alcohol—I mean, that’s practically likedrinking a beer. This is just one of the mostdeliciously refreshing, quaffable white winesin the store, bar none…and luckily it comes ina one-liter bottle!

"I'm known to be a fairly loquacious person. I like to talk. And write. Never in my life have I been asked or told to make a piece longer. It is that fact that  surprised me looking back upon my tasting notes from this past week, at which I had the honor of tasting this rare bottle of what is arguably the world's most famous Champagne brand. Here's the complete text of what I wrote down: ""AMMMAAAZZZIIINNNGGG!!! Did I write about the  how the seven additional years of lees contact gives it an intense richness. What about how the black and red fruit balances perfectly with the minerality of clay and limestone? Nope. None of that. This is one bottle of champagne that needs one word, and one word alone. AMAZING!

"This second release of the 1998 has been delicately aging on its lees for well over 12 years before being disgorged and it shows in how beautifully mature and layered the aromatics are. I was extremely impressed at how vinous and structured this 18 year old cuvee was tasting and the integrated bouquet was just the icing on the top.

"I tasted this simply gorgeous release from Dom Perignon on the 24th of August, 2015. This late-disgorged beauty (2012) is completely different than any DP I have ever tasted. It has fresh doughy notes on the nose that hint at a richness that we expect from this producer BUT, it also has a fantastic minerality and salinity. There is a nice, spicy character on the palate with tart cherry notes and just the slightest hint of toasted nuts. The finish is long with buttery notes and then zap(!), the acidity kicks in for a racy finish that lingers and lingers and lingers. Simply wonderful! Hand disgorged. A must buy for collectors as well as for those of you that are looking for a very special bottle for yourself or for a gift.

"I first tasted the 1998 Dom Perignon P2 Brut Champagne with Pacific King Salmon, Spring Squash and Porcini Mushrooms at Madera restaurant. This was in a completely different league than the initial release of 1998; gone was the big hit of yeast and instead the wine showed elegance that I rarely associate with this vintage. It had a gorgeous store of pin point streamers and a generous nose of black cherry Pinot. The finish went on and on.

"When I tried this the other night, I knew I was in for a good bottle of bubbly with Coutelas on the label, but my company and I were genuinely stunned by just how good it was.  This Premier Cru blanc de blanc pours a deep golden color, has rich fruit with honey, acacia blossom, candied apricots, and a beautiful leesy toastiness. The texture is velvety and creamy, with fine bubbles and a nearly eternal finish. The only problem was that we ran out too soon—should have gotten another bottle!

"Made from 100% Pinot Noir. The minerality in this low sulfite, no-dosage Brut Nature is vibrant alongside the dry, bright red fruit flavor of the Pinot Noir.  The clean, crisp finish seals this as one of the best Brut Natures in stock.

"If you like rancio, this’d be your manzanilla! A robust nose of nuts, salt, rubber, yeast and bruised apple leads to a similarly bold palate of salty, rocky, yeasty, oily, rubbery flavors.

Absolutely lovely pairing with an aged manchego, I reckon this would call out the best from parmesan and other dry, aged cheeses, too.

"Wow! What a beautifully complex Champagne from Laurent Perrier. The Grand Siecle Brut is one of my favorites, so I already knew this rose would be special.

"This is great Champagne- and perhaps one of the best values for money in any category of wine. Louis Roederer has been pushing quality like few others in the region over the last decade, and no wine shows the heights that they have reached as well as the Brut Premier. With massive investment in organic viticulture, including a massive purchase of 1er vineyards from Leclerc-Briant, a return to plowing in the vineyard instead of chemical treatment and obsession with every detail in the winery they have created something here that has no rival among the big names, especially at this price. The 1/3 of the fruit that they buy comes from growers like Benoit Marguet- so you know they are getting top stuff. While most of my time is spent advocating for single origin Champagnes, this bottle is a great argument for blending and the balance that cellar master Jean-Baptiste Lecaillon created here is second to none. This wine has a great brioche nose and plenty of vivacious sparkle. It is a perfect aperitif!

"While I've been obsessing over the 2008s, It's great to lift my head and remember the wonderful champagne from vintages to come. 2012, while an extremely tough spring and summer, lead to a miraculously perfect fall. The grapes that made it to the end, although a small amount, are high quality, rich and concentrated. The 2012 Carte D'Or, encompases the vintage's full charater with bold aromatics and finness on the palate. The wine is 50% Mesnil Chardonnay and Pinot Noir from their oldest vines in Verzenay. It is filled with notes of tart raspberry and fresh lemon and just a hint of nutty richness.

"This “Gold Card” blend from our favorite Verzeney producer Michel Arnould is made from half estate-grown Grand Cru Pinot Noir, half Grand Cru Chardonnay from the Côte de Blancs.  The vintage showcases rich, concentrated white-fleshed fruit notes with vibrant acidity and the balance only true craftsmanship and extended aging on the lees can produce.
",Other White Wines
"Arnould's Carte d'Or is fantastic stuff. While I realize I may be preaching to the choir if you are already on this product page, please allow me to tempt you/fill you in if this is a new name for you! The Montagne de Reims village of Verzenay, home base for Michel Arnould, is Pinot Noir country - grand cru Pinot Noir country at that. The wine from here is distinctive even in Arnould's NV bottlings, though in as strong a vintage as 2012 - a consensus pick for one of the best vintages of the last twenty among Champagne growers - the wine simply becomes a must have. Nutty aromas show fruit, though the nose to me is more savory than fruit forward. The palate is all about balance: complete, nicely dry, some golden fruits and still with years of development ahead of it. I could bore you about the virtues of ageing Champagne, far more effective however would be to purchase some of these and crack open a bottle or two every so often over the course of several years, or much, much longer!

"Wine professionals and those who are working really hard to improve their wine knowledge would love to find bottles like this.  For those with a little less serious and determined intentions, you will be pleasantly surprised at the quality and precision in a Raised by Wolves wine.  So why is it such a special bottle? Pinot Meunier (famously the 3rd grape used in Champagne and also red), pressed whole cluster so a little skin contact happens between the pressed juice and the red colored pigment under the grape’s skin turning the wine just the palest, copper-salmon color, and last we introduce the terroir of South Africa; amazing combination wine nerds!  The nose starts out with ripe melon, roses, and yellow pear.  The finer, secondary notes start to build on the second sniff with hints of herb (thyme and sage), a chalky, dusty minerality and some carmel tones can be found.  The first sip on the palate exposes a viscous body with a small amount of tannin to add structure to this delicate frame.  Rosewater, cantaloupe and watermelon work in concert with thyme and jasmine as the caramel from the nose moves to echoes of butterscotch on the palate.  Fun stuff and well made; I can’t wait to see it again in 2017.

"Looking for a wine to go with a cheese plate?  I got your cheese wine right here!  Made from an obscure varietal called Mauzac from an obscure little AOC called Gaillac in South West France, this fun bottle of bubbles is the perfect compliment to a brunch date, a cheese party or a great movie at home.  It's light and delicate with notes of freshly pressed apple juice, white flowers and crisp green pears.  It's something that would be easy to pass up on the shelf given the region and the varietal, but you absolutely should not pass this up!  It's fun and delicious with a price that makes it a no brainer when you want to give something new a whirl!

"Compared to our other delicious $15 Godello from Valdesil, the Vina Godeval shows more yellow and stone fruit, with a bit more volume. Godello is definitely the white everyone is after in Spain, and tasting how good it can be, from well made inexpensive versions such as this on up to more rare $50 bottlings, I can see why! This wine's fruity freshness makes it perfect as an aperitive.

"From one of our favorite Spanish producers in Raventos i Blanc comes this tete de cuvee, a selection personally selected by someone who is by all accounts an incredibly gifted taster, owner Manuel Raventos. This spend 72 months on  the lees and shows lovely toasty and doughy qualitites, though incredible structure and freshness, all the more impressive given the length of its ageing. Only 2000 bottles of this delicious and serious wine were produced.
",Other White Wines
"109 Mesos is the tete de cuvee at Can Mayol. The oldest vine Xarel-lo vines are blended with a 10% dash of Chardonnay, and as the name suggests aged on its lees for 109 months, under cork. In fact, it is never disgorged, as winemaker Josep Mitjans believes that for this cuvee the lees, which contributes to the wine's complexity, longevity and freshness, should be allowed to do so right up until the point of purchase. That said, you will need a toolbox on hand to grab a pair of pliers, bend the iron prongs and disgorge this beauty yourself. You will be amply rewarded with one of the most original bottles of bubbles in our inventory. Maybe about seven years ago, I tasted just a few of the bubblies from Loxarel at a Spanish wine trade show. Ever since then I have been hooked. I have consumed so many bottles across their dizzying array of products, and built up so much product conviction along the way, that I would put these up against any sparkling wines in the store.
",Other White Wines
"I must admit that these bubbles puzzled me at first, it was obviously Champagne, I read the label, it came in a Champagne bottle but there was something different. It took me about 10 minutes to figure it out, this wine just has a more vinous complexity to it, and the 7 years on the lees really changed the dynamic of the wine. Yes there were bubbles and it seemed like a regular Champagne on your tongue but the flavors were not so simple. I really liked this wine the more I tried it, the super dryness almost flinty on your palate then slowly the layers of brioche, spice and mineral emerge. The more I tasted it the more it seemed like Chablis with bubbles, so strident, focused and lemony tartness with bits of baking spice complexity, all it needed was the right dish to pair with it. Oysters immediately came to mind but I’m thinking lobster and butter is what this bubbly needs, the richness of the lobster and the vibrant focus of the Baron Fuente 7, wow, a perfect match.
",Other White Wines
"At first, I found this unique release to be chalky with spiced nuts (on the nose) and saline scents. Once the air hit it, yellow apple and guava came to the forefront and then, the chardonnay citrus definitely took over. Creamy, but, the lemon and spice flavors dominate in the end. To date, the most interesting release that we have had from this venerable producer and that includes the Meunier heavy releases that I love so much. Well worth the wait for us to acquire it!

"How exciting!  A new release from the baron of great values in Champagne, Baron Fuente!  Correction, a new OLD release from Baron Fuente.  The 7 began a journey that would eventually lead to our shelves (and hopefully your champagne glass) almost eight years ago, and the story it tells fun, intriguing and ultimately one I plan to revisit many times.  The barrel aging of 20% of the Chardonnay gives the blend a beautiful creamy, viscous texture to go along with aromas of dried fruits, pear, honeysuckle and almond, all finished by great acidity.  This is definitely a wine that makes keeping your guests' flutes full a real challenge.
",Other White Wines
"Finally! I've been hearing about this project from Gary for some time now and it's finally arrived and is in my glass. 7 years on the lees and a little portion of barrel fermented Chardonnay imparts a spectacular brioche character to this wine and great richness. The 7 grams/liter dosage is the perfect balance for the focused acidity. The all estate fruit is full of apples, pears, and bits of dark cherry shine through from the Pinot. All this at the amazing prices we expect from Baron Fuente and our direct import relationship. There is no better wine on the shelf for 50 bucks.
",Other White Wines
"This is beautiful, majestic, and transformative Champagne, the kind that combines all of the regions most characteristic elements into one perfect package. You get the freshness of that laser-like acidity, mineral, oyster shell notes from the chalky Champagne soils, a leesy brioche creaminess from the seven years of lees aging. Champagne is both famous and expensive because only wine from Champagne can taste this way. Anyone can make sparkling wine, but nowhere else do you get such a combination of these distinct elements: they are what make a great Champagne stand out from the pack. In this Baron Fuente ""7"" edition, you get everything I describe in clear, delineated flavor profiles, easy to pick out, yet seamless in their integration.
",Other White Wines
"I have been waiting eight long years for the premier of this tete de cuvée Champagne from Baron Fuente, and I am thrilled to finally be able to offer it! This wine has concentration and focus that is up their with the best Champagne that we offer. It is the first time that they have introduced a proportion of barrel fermented Champagne in one of their wines, and just like the vintage offerings from houses like Billecart and Roederer, it only shows in texture- there is no wood flavor at all! This is vibrant, mineral driven Champagne that has the pin point streamers and fine texture that only a long seven years of ageing on the lees will bring. This is one of the great deals in top notch Champagne that we offer!

"The Bruno Michel “Rebelle” offers much more richness than most Extra Brut Champagnes, and with the lovely acidity and minerality characteristics, this makes for a great sushi pairing!  The Rebelle will delight your palate with the crisp acidity and luscious apple type fruits.  If you like sushi, I highly recommend pairing the two!  It goes great with yellow tail, salmon, spicy tuna and many other types of seafood, but it is the wasabi and soy sauce that really makes the pairing special.  Don’t hesitate -- treat yourself to sushi and this Champagne tonight!

"This extra Brut will surprise and seduce your palate. Aromas of baked stone fruits of apples, pear, and pie crust.

"I typically don't drink a lot of extra brut because it always makes me want a giant plate of fresh oysters (which are hard to get in LA), but the Bruno Michelle Rebelle is so full of ripe, baked pomme fruit that it's delicious on its own, with sushi or a plate of oysters (if you have easy access to one). The Rebelle is an extra brut in the way extra brut was meant to be; enough ripe natural sugar the way mother nature intended so that additional sugar isn't needed!

"From my top 10 Champagnes of 2012: Cinnamon was staying up in the city with her friend Jenna on a Friday night, and I grabbed some sushi to go and headed home to dine with our cat, the Morsel. While she helped with the sushi, she did not have a single sip of the Champagne. I believe in the saying that one should be moderate in all things, so I got carried away and drank the whole bottle. Drinking Champagne by yourself is a great thing- if you never have done it there is no better treat, and no better place than the home for having an extra glass or two. From my personal tasting diary: “This wine was a lot richer than I remember and I suspect the base must be from the extroverted 2006 harvest. The balance was so perfect it hardly seemed “Extra” Brut like, rather just vibrant, nervy, electrically mineral sud-Eprenay stuff. It went best with the Akasaka Roll which has eel and avocado on the outside and tempura shrimp on the inside- and very well with everything else. I got carried away by its ample charm and finished the bottle. I woke refreshed and ready for a busy December Saturday- and it turned out to be one of my best days at work all year. I guess there is something to be said for drinking organic after all!” This bottle deserves its spot on the top 10- try it out and see if you can resist finishing the whole thing…

"No great vintage from Champagne drinks as well as the 1988's do right now, and I think it is safe to say that this vintage is even better than the flashier 1989 and 1990 harvests that got more press at the time. To drink one of the very best from this harvest is a huge treat, and Champagne, even wine in general does not get better than this 1988 Krug Brut Champagne. Cinnamon and I drank this fabulous bottle, which was a gift from a great customer and friend as the aperitif in the Santa Cruz Mountains. The deep brassy color and generous chanterelle, cream and nutty Pinot Noir cherry nose gave way to a graceful, vivacious impression on the palate- this Champagne has it all. The finish is still with me if I think back to it and is one of the most complete experiences I have had from a wine. Wow!

"This is not one of the thunderous, thick-textured roussannes that sometimes emerge from California. While it has breadth, the overall feeling is taut and springy and the finish is lively and fresh. Dusty, spiced lemon and vanilla flavors meld with a hint of peach, musk and wet rocks. A short stay in the cellar, on the order of a year or two, would probably allow this wine to “knit” and be better still.

"What a wower of a bottle. There are not many Champagnes made from individual walled vineyards, but they are justifiably famous in spite of their tiny production. Wines like Krug’s Clos du Mesnil and Clos Ambonnay are fantastically expensive, while Philipponnat Clos des Goisses is near impossible to get. This brassy powerhouse comes from two acres planted to 1/6 each Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Meunier, Arbanne, Petite Meslier and Pinot Blanc. The result is a vinous, gold-straw-colored show-stopper that crackles with citric acidity on its very long, strong finish. This is a must for every serious fan of Champagne to try--it is expensive, but the price can only go up…

"Vigneti Massa is one of my absolute favorite Italian vintners and I was more than excited to see not only his entry level wines in the store but his cru's as well.  He's responsible for single handedly saving this wonderful grape from extinction in Piemonte.  I hadn't had the pleasure of tasting the single vineyard site Timorasso's until today and they are phenomenal!  The Montecitorio is fresh, clean, textured and aromatic all at once.  There's a flinty mineral note, honey, honeysuckle and saline jumping out of the glass.  The wine has oomph!  It's got a weighty texture but the acidity is almost electric.  If you can manage to keep your hands off of it, it could cellar for quite some time and would only get better with age.  Fans of Chenin Blanc, unoaked Chardonnay or Alsatian Riesling should definitely give this grape a try!

"This blend of three different grape varieties, grown in the classic district of Terlano (South-Tyrol), is as versatile a wine as you'll find from anywhere, and a seriously good value besides. A blend used quite successfully for over 100 years, this cuvee of Pinot Bianco, Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc, fermented at controlled temperature in stainless steel vats offers fruity aromatics with light yeasty notes and a taste that is always harmonious though quite strong on the palate and very persistent.
",Pinot Blanc
"This is from a hillside in the town of Terlano in the Alto Adige where the soil is sandy, gravely and calcareous. A great place to plant grapes?  This is what makes this so unique and the wines of this region unique as well.

"I’ll never forget my first visit to Vorberg, in German it basically means in front of the mountain, it is a vineyard that is seemingly applied to the steep face of the mountain. I put my hands in the soil to smell what it was like, intensely salty, how intense? I couldn’t get the smell off my hands for two days! This is the home of Vorberg one of the Alto Adige’s greatest white wines, they last an incredibly long time, I’ve had them back into the 1950’s. The nose is mineral driven then layers of ripe pear, fruit blossom and hints of bergamot. On the palate the wine has incredible intensity and weight, yet the richness of the wine balances the high acidity to the point it seems smooth. Long and intense finish, try it with Lobster or Halibut.
",Pinot Blanc
"I love a good age-worthy white wine and this Terlan Pinot Bianco is just that. The depth and texture of the wine reminds me of a premier cru Bourgogne blanc, making it a wonderful wine to enjoy now, the high elevation of the vineyard site adds acidity making it cellar-friendly. If enjoying now you will find a light aromatics that lead into a beautiful floral and full bodied wine. It is elegant and not overreaching. Stunning from start to finish.

"2015 has turned out to be a first rate vintage for Italian white wines so those from top tier producers like Villa Russiz are especially impressive. Their Pinot Bianco combines wonderful aromas of white florals and subtle orchard fruit with a palate of soft apple flavors enveloped by overall richness and density. Although it's medium-to-full-bodied the acidity keeps the wine bright and fresh on the finish.

"The Meyer family has been making wine since 1620 in Bergholtz in southern Alsace on approximately 22 acres of land bought by the family after the French Revolution. Today the family continues farming their land with the next 350 years in mind for future generations; cultivated biodynamic and organic certified since 1991.  The 2016 Pinot Blanc is bright in the glass with a dense aroma of yellow plumb and honeydew accented with gooseberry citrus notes and some wet granite like minerality.  On the palate the wine is viscous and round with the melon building around secondary notes of white pepper, honeycomb and wild flowers.
",Pinot Blanc
"As much as I love a good Italian Pinot Grigio, lately the Pinot Biancos have been getting my attention. The St. Michael Eppan is full of sophisticated aromatics as well as  elegances and balance that is carried from nose to palate. The warmth from the 2015 vintage shows through the weight, texture and yellow orchard fruit character on the mid palate. The regional acidity of the Alto Adige softly carries the wine into a long, graceful finish.
",Pinot Blanc
"I am a devotee of the Pinot Blanc grape in almost all its manifestations, but nowhere does it reach such a perfect balance as in the Alto Adige region of Italy. This is a great example of the lighter, more mineral-driven style of Pinot Blanc, that  still retains a certain creamy texture inherent in the varietal. Austere and stony on the nose, the wine displays a round, melon fruit on the palate, with just the right amount of zippy acidity to keep it light and focused. Though lesser known than its cousin Pinot Grigio, the Pinot Bianco grape is well worth exploring, particularly from the region of Alto Adige, where it often performs beautifully.
",Pinot Blanc
"If you tend to think of Pinot Blanc as blousy, soft, and boring, this bottle may well change your mind. This is an intensely aromatic wine, with Riesling-like petrol notes, and very stony, focused floral hints. On the palate the wine shows some soft melon fruit, but is completely dry, with a a very strong mineral drive, and just a little bit of texture from the year spent on its lees. Overall a much more exciting and poised version of the varietal!
",Pinot Blanc
"Italy produces an ocean of Pinot Grigio and I’ll have to say most of it is not very exciting, this wine however is STUNNING! The 2016 vintage is one of Italy’s best. The nose is wow, full of a blend of complex stone fruit and waves of Alpine flowers. On the palate this wine has everything, richness, incredible balance and a long, long finish, it truly out does the entire category.
",Pinot Gris
"A delicious little everyday white.  Food friendly and easy drinking this Pinot Gris would pair well with everything from Holiday dinners to spicy Thai food.  It's balanced between rich, ripe stone and orchard fruit and crisp, refreshing citrus.  A slam dunk for any night of the week.
",Pinot Gris
"This has some of the dried fruit flavors you get in Alsatian Pinot Gris but is less austere and has more textural richness.  There is melon, crushed citrus and hints of peach and apricot in the juicy middle.  The finish is fresh and palate cleansing.  Perfect for Summer BBQs
",Pinot Gris
"Early summer in a glass! Cool Peach and melon notes with a subtle spice notes and a crisp citrusy finish.  This is a delightful everyday white that can be paired with both simple and exotic foods or simply as an aperitif with friends.
",Pinot Gris
"I really like everything that I have tasted from Pike Road. The Pinot Gris tastes like it cost more money. It is clean and crisp but has enough fruit to make it very easy to drink. This wine is  a very pleasurable drink/ It will go well alone or with fish or chicken.
",Pinot Gris
"I confess I do have a soft spot for Pinot Gris, usually from Alsace, so it was a welcoming surprise when I tried this one from Oregon. In comparison with the Alsatian ones, it definite has more lushness and ripeness, but not heaviness at all. I had it  twice with an Indian chicken curry and later with a Thai chicken satay. It was a divine pairing both times.
",Pinot Gris
"One of my favorite little finds for everyday drinking out of Oregon! The Pike Road Pinot Gris is a new wine from Elk Cove winery, made using their neighbor's grapes. This wine is light, tangy, and full of citrus and verbena notes. Tending to the more savory side of Pinot Gris, this wine is excellent with lighter dishes, salads, and hard-to-pair veggie plates.
",Pinot Gris
"My problem with natural wine tends to be that I end up drinking more bad ones than actual good ones. Fortunately, everything I've had from Donkey and Goat has always been really good, if not fantastic. The Ramato Pinot Gris is beyond exceptional. If you're trying to find a great orange wine, I strongly recommend this one. The finish is dry, and apricot-esque. Definitely worth a whirl.
",Pinot Gris
"This was such an interesting try. Pinot Gris from Germany.. awesome! A beautiful nose of  pear, granny smith apples and honey, delicately express themselves when you first approach the wine. Having seen no oak, the wine is bright and minerally with a rich full body. Pineapple and kiwi round out this outstanding wine.
",Pinot Gris
"Wow! I wrote my tasting notes before seeing the price.  Buy a case! I thought this wine drank like a solid $16.99 NZ Pinot, but I guess because of the collaboration between K&L and some of our Kiwi winemaker friends we are getting a smoking deal (!?!). So here we go: fresh (not baked) black cherry meets ripe strawberry and ground white pepper to kick off an energetic nose.  A second swirl and sniff are required to dig deeper and you find secondary notes of earthy bramble, rose water, toast and now black pepper.  On the palate the wine has real presence; mouth filling without being flabby or flat.  The lifted style does offer savory character and the bouquet reflects the flavor profile in a very satisfying, spice accented finish.
",Pinot Noir
"'Why can't we all just get along?' Well, it's nice to see this hopeful  thought works somewhere in the world. Take for instance, wine, where for several seasons now our resident Kiwi guru Ryan Woodhouse has collaborated with the fine folks at Te Whare Ra in Marlborough to create superbly crafted, small production bottlings from select fruit. Their achievement is your gain, as this modestly-priced Pinot Noir possesses varietally pure aromatic elements, evocative of wild berries, black plums and cherries, with a savory, mid-weight mouthfeel and excellent delineation on the smooth finish. Coming in at only 13.5% ABV, it  would make an excellent, well-balanced red for Thanksgiving dinner and throughout the holidays.
",Pinot Noir
"Basically declassified TWR (Te Whare Ra) showing bright black cherry and dark plum fruit, anise, pepper and other spices and a full, layered mouth-feel.  This is an amazing deal in a Pinot of depth, complexity and weight.
",Pinot Noir
"It is light in color and very aromatic, almost perfumed; a very pretty wine. Cola, cherry, plums on the palate. Medium body. I would serve it with a very light chill with spicy foods or even richer fish.
",Pinot Noir
"Man, I love this wine. I had this again the other evening with pank-crusted salmon and a spinach salad, and it was light, pretty and delicious. Soft raspberry, strawberry and citrus with the tiniest hint of sweetness. The acidity really worked with my salmon's fattiness. Of course, the wine's pink sparkly glimmer on the dinner table in my wine glasses added to the ambiance. Stock up for birthday celebrations, brunch, baby showers, or just because it's a Tuesday night!
",Pinot Noir
"This is absolutely one of the best tasting Cremant Rose that I've had. It is balanced and crisp, with nice notes of fruitiness and acidity. Always buy two bottles...because your first one will keep you wanting more!
",Pinot Noir
"Tucked in the hills, just two miles from the Sonoma Coast, is the winery Flowers; always a very elegant Pinot Noir.   With one of the most beautiful settings of any winery, this very special terroir produces some amazing wines, the nose blooming with wild raspberry , pomegranate, lavender, and rose petal.  The new Flowers Sonoma Coast Pinot is remarkably balanced, cultivating soothing feelings of jubilation grafted with elegance and sophistication.  Emerging from a selection of family - owned sites, and including  aromas of wild strawberry, cranberry, delicate baking spices and forest floor lift elegantly from the glass.  Very lively on the palate with a snap of acidity, red cherry, hibiscus and sea salt with graceful tannins round out the glass.  Grilled lamb chops would be a fantastic pairing.
",Pinot Noir
"Flowers' wines have long been a go-to for me. For decades they have been a shinning light of Sonoma Coast grape growing and have been instrumental in establishing one of the world's foremost regions for Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. In the last few years I think the wines have continued to go from strength to strength finding more refinement and elegance than ever before. The wine making is deliberate and precise but never overpowers the delicacy of fruit or sense of place. It's expressive and accessible right out of the gate but also has layers and detail that unfolds with time and hold your attention. A bright, floral, lifted profile leads into a juicy core of ripe berry fruits, raspberry coulis, with some lovely savory, baking spice nuances. The wine's medium-bodied character and balance make it a very versatile food wine but one that is also perfectly delicious all alone.
",Pinot Noir
"The cool, coastal influence shows beautifully on this well balanced Pinot. The ""up front"" fruit on the nose show tons of depth, pointing to this wine's great complexity. Velvety on the palate with a touch of bramble fruit make for an exciting Pinot that can pair up to a lot of different foods.
",Pinot Noir
"In recent years Flowers has really stepped up its game - they've always produced marvelously lush and approachable wines, but lately their wine-making style has pivoted to a more delicate style.  Notes of ripe red cherries, red berries, shaved fennel and cola with a bit of clove and baking spices to round out the finish.  The wine sees a 9-day cold soak and contains declassified fruit from their upper tier bottlings such as Camp Meeting Ridge and a few others.  Huge value for a top-notch Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir.  Drink now.
",Pinot Noir
"Nice and balanced, with beautiful aromatics of cherries, strawberries and cola. On the palate it is never heavy, and its velvety tannins make the whole experience quite phenomenal. A deliciously elegant Pinot showing off California greatest.
",Pinot Noir
"In many ways P&H is the quintessential Sonoma Coast Pinot delivering on that promise without ignoring that it is in fact Pinot Noir. This nose is open and full of dark cherry and wild red fruit, it's open and expressive but not dominated completely by the fruit. Hints of savory herbs and earthy spice float around behind the focused fruit. On the palate everything is in line, but what gets me most excited is the structure. Instead of the overly extracted texture we're used to in Sonoma these days, we're getting vivid acid and a crunchy silky tannin that gives this one some real depth. Balanced without any overt oak or unkempt quality whatsoever. I'd love to drink a few cases of this over the next 5-10 years. I remember this being more expensive...
",Pinot Noir
"This wine continues to be a benchmark for Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir. This regional bottling comes from a shortlist of some of the best vineyards in the area including: Dutton Ranch, Martinelli and Gap's Crown. The wine is perfectly polished, bursting with bright expressive fruit, a supple, silky texture, exotic oak spice and a vibrant lift of coastal acidity and energy. Nothing is forced or over-done, the wine making shows a calm confidence in the quality and purity of fruit, expertly crafted into a wine that's easy to love and sure to impress.
",Pinot Noir
"For fans of Aubert who want to spend a fraction of the money! Seamless, round and ripe fruit glide right along the palate. Cherries, cola, and a touch of stone make this Pinot very Burgundian at heart, but with a California flare. Grab a bunch and put it away; the core of flavor will be amazing in 5-8 years.
",Pinot Noir
"When I think of a classic, varietally correct example of a Sonoma Pinot Noir, my immediate go to is Patz Hall. I love the intense aromatics of cherry and strawberry coupled by the elegant yet pleasing palate. High-toned aromatics of wild strawberry and cherry-cola are coupled with subtle spice and sweet earth. What makes this Sonoma appellated Pinot stand out is the beautiful, refined texture and persistently long finish.
",Pinot Noir
"Every previous vintage of Patz & Hall I've had has always delivered on a level of consistency like no other, and the 2015 Sonoma Coast Pinot is no exception. This bottle delivers a bright level of acidity, and mellow subtleties of strawberry, raspberry and slight bell pepper. Did this wine go through a little bit a whole cluster fermentation? I'm not sure, but if it did, great! The 2015 Sonoma Coast Pinot is fantastic regardless.
",Pinot Noir
"The new vintage of Pike Road is a compellingly subtle, rather Burgundian Pinot Noir that showcases a level of nuance and restraint too rare in this price point. Balanced red currant and cherry, aromatic tea leaves, light hints of baking spice, and comfortably integrated acidity elevate this offering above so many others for a similar price. Perhaps the best Pinot in the shop under $20.
",Pinot Noir
"Another wonderful Pinot Noir  from Pike Road which is made by Elk Cove. There are nice ripe cherry aromas that are very inviting. In the mouth the dark fruit theme continues ,with a juicy round but not real heavy Pinot Noir. This wine was made to drink now and will go well alone or with lighter foods.
",Pinot Noir
"Crafted from cool climate, hand harvested, coastal Pinot Noir planted in calcareous soil, this wine is an immense value. The winemakers at Fossil Point are dedicated to environmental sustainability, and are part of the Central Coast AVA's Sustainability In Practice program, or SIP. Each sip of this wine is better than the next, with notes of bright bing and black cherry and subtle spice, almost impossibly prolonged with a briny, unique minerality. For those who typically like their Pinot on the lighter side, this is for you, as it is beautifully complex, but compellingly unencumbered.
",Pinot Noir
"Once again this value bottling rises well above its humble price point and provides a delicious and affordable choice for Pinot Noir lovers.  This starts out with gentle earthy notes, bright cherry fruit, spice  and a generous texture from the neutral oak.  This is sweet and lively with very fine tannins on the finish and a lot of personality.
",Pinot Noir
"Another great over the shoulder Pinot.  This is a cannot miss value Pinot.  Clean, precise Pinot Noir fruit with a hint of spice and a whisp of something floral.  Medium light bodied with that great fruit resting on modest tannins and lively acidity.  Nothing in the store, from any country comes close to how good this wine is for the money.
",Pinot Noir
"After forty-five or so years in wine retail, the one sales event that still gets me excited is finding really excellent, near-term wines at some ridiculously ""cheap"" price and convincing you to buy and try them. It is an effortless endeavor to sell the Pichon Lalandes, Opus Ones, or DRCs in today's market; when it comes to selling wines to our customers, as with this lovely Pinot Noir Gem from Oakridge Estate, it seems that it takes four times my energy to convince people to at least try them. Produced from estate vineyard blocks that did not go into the final single-vineyard productions, this excellent creation by winemaker, David Bicknell, is medium-deep ruby in color, offers distinctively floral {jasmine and roses) to black cherry, plum-like, raspberry aromas with undertones of cedar, musk, and spice {all-spice}. These characteristics carry over wonderfully to a broad, fleshy, viscous, bright palate impression with excellent balance, elegance and integration, which in turn leads to a long, soft, silky finish. Don't look at the price; it might scare you off from buying it. In any case, Rusty has ordered me to bring home at least several cases of this amazing Gem for our intermittent consumption over the next three to five years. A GREAT LOW COST VALUE! ***** 14.4% ABV ***** .....A K&L WINE MERCHANTS' DIRECT IMPORT.....

"This is the best value California Pinot you'll find at K&L. The winemakers at Banshee deliver, yet again, a fantastic Pinot from the Sonoma Coast. Notes of dark fruit, baking spices, silky tannins and a juicy wine to boot! You'll be drinking this phenomenal Pinot beyond holiday dinners.
",Pinot Noir
"Beautiful and reserves, for California Pinot.  Red fruits, floral hints, touch of spice, easy soft tannins. It is hard not to like this wine.
",Pinot Noir
"Another great vintage of Banshee Pinot Noir. The 2015 vintage was marked by lower harvest yields due to drought; the quality of fruit was still superb. Most of the fruit is sourced from the Sonoma Coast appellation, with a multitude of single-vineyard sites being featured in the final blend. In doing so, this provides a high-quality California Pinot Noir for under $25. Initial notes of intense raspberry and fresh cranberry. Underlying Saigon cinnamon and rose petals following. Palate leads with bold cranberry, dark cherry, hibiscus, and subtle hints of vanilla and baking spice. Dark berry and plum as well.
",Pinot Noir
"We have a string of great vintages taking place this decade, starting with 2012 harvest and up to 2016 that I honestly believe has been unmatched in the history of California winemaking. The closest decade that gave us close to the strength of these five vintages was the mid-1990s (1994 to 1997) with some real exceptional wines being produced. Again, starting with 2012 and thus far ending with 2016, the wines that are coming from the one vintage that I have anxiously been waiting for is 2015, which I consider is the best of those five years and, in particular, the Pinot Noirs from the cooler coastal appellations (Russian River Valley, Sonoma Coast, Anderson Valley, and Santa Lucia Mountains). The Banshee Pinots have always been outstanding productions and at very reasonable prices, but this 2015 is breathtaking and an absolute steal at the price we are offering it for. Deeply colored, although it is only 13.6% alcohol, the nose gushes forth opulent aromas of dried rose petals, strawberry, black cherry, and plum-like characteristics with undertones of truffles, structured by forest floor to stone-like slate minerality. All of this carries over to a broad, viscous, concentrated, fleshy mouthfeel that is amazingly deep and complex with finely etched tannins, leading to a silky, round, and elegant finish that refuses to go away. Although this Gem drinks incredibly well now, especially with decanting and airing, Rusty and I plan to put several cases of this great Pinot down for another eight to fifteen years or longer; it will only get better, believe it or not. A GREAT VALUE!!! ***** 13.6% ABV *****
",Pinot Noir
"This year’s Banshee Sonoma County Pinot Noir is somewhat of a departure from the norm-- not in quality, as this is still at the epitome of quality for Pinot Noir of this price point--but in style. In 2015 Mother Nature gave everyone in the wine business a challenge, but Banshee passed the test, making an ethereal, feminine styled Pinot Noir that bucks the trend of super concentrated and sometimes overly intense young wines from this vintage. They managed the tannins and fruit concentration to near perfection in this difficult year and produced a wine of delicacy and freshness. Supple and lacy on the palate, this wine has a wealth of floral undertones and well-placed blue fruits, all the while running a ribbon of cardamom and fennel spice through the appealing blueberry-driven finish. Banshee 2015 Pinot is less about bombast and primary fruit as has been the case in the past and is a more fully formed, and realized, Pinot at the highest level of quality on the market for under $25.
",Pinot Noir
"The team at Banshee has exceeded all expectations yet again for their Sonoma County Pinot Noir! How they are able to add more high quality sites each vintage, yet keep the price under $25, is a feat itself, but means nothing if the wine isn't good. This 2015 is beautiful, with less forward ripe fruit than past vintages, instead showing a prettier, floral and spicy side of coastal Pinot Noir.
",Pinot Noir
"While the guys at Banshee are light-hearted and like to have a lot of fun, they also know how to make a seriously great wine! We've been following the Banshee story from the very beginning and while all of the Sonoma County Pinots have been great, I think this is my favorite vintage to date! This Pinot hits all the notes for me; it's expressively aromatic with beautiful high-tone floral and red fruit notes, there's plenty of ripe, sweet fruit on the mid-palate, there's spice and copious amounts of it, but what strikes me the most about this wine is the purity and honesty of this wine. This Pinot Noir is one of the most well-rounded and balanced Pinots under $25 that I've ever had!
",Pinot Noir
"Banshee truly delivers top quality Pinot Noirs that I love drinking and I love handing to customers. This 2015 Pinot is beautifully elegant with feminine and floral notes that just jump out of the glass. Rose petal, plum and red cherries are paired with black pepper, baking spice and well-integrated oak. Delicious and drinkable now!
",Pinot Noir
"Banshee consistently makes impressively concentrated Pinots at disproportionately low price points. For under $25, the entry-level 2015 is a seriously focused Pinot with the power, complexity, and simultaneous finesse that defines excellent California Pinot. Showing great complexity at the entry level, it delivers a vivid core of tart cherries and black raspberry, pie crust, subtle herbs, dried flowers, warm spice, and subtle pepperiness. Acidity is integrated and bracing while silky tannins keep the finish persistent. Deeply enjoyable, especially for the price!
",Pinot Noir
"Banshee wines are always of exemplary quality, but this particular vintage of the Sonoma County Pinot Noir is special. The palate is intense and bold, with bright floral notes of rose and hibiscus. Deep smoky aromas of white pepper and paprika and tart cherry-plum create an immersive, sensory experience to relish!
",Pinot Noir
"Wow! This is really one of the best Pinot Noirs I've tasted at this price point. The bouquet has notes of plum, dark strawberry, clove, chocolate and earth. On the palate there is beautiful balance, with good acidity, soft tannins and very good length. If you're a fan of Pinot, don't miss this great value. Mike ( Guido) Parres
",Pinot Noir
"Consistently one of my favorite Californian Pinot Noirs at this price! Bishop's Peak is made by Talley Winery, and the fruit comes from a vineyard neighboring the Talley estate. The quality of the wine-making is excellent, and like all the Talley wines, showcases a style whose middle name is balance. The Bishop's Peak Pinot is full of bright, red fruits such as cranberry and raspberry, with an elegant hint of clove spice, and a soft, fine tannin. On the palate the wine is medium to lighter bodied, but with ripe berry fruit following through to the finish.
",Pinot Noir
"This little beauty is a side project of Talley vineyards, so you get that Talley quality at a great price! Bright, almost sour, nose of red fruits and baking spices. On the palate, dark strawberry and raspberry fruit with an overlay of spice and cinnamon. A nice, lingering finish that is bright with acidity. Pretty and pretty affordable!
",Pinot Noir
"Could be the best domestic Pinot for around $25 in the store.  This wine has purity, complexity, balance and drive.  It is simply great Pinot Noir.
",Pinot Noir
"From the good folks at Talley Vineyards in Arroyo Grande, the fruit for this wine comes from a vineyard adjacent to the estate. Always one of the better Pinot Noir values under $20, this 2015 vintage is truly outstanding! Lightly floral on the nose with intriguing spice notes. Bright and lively and very fresh on first impression, turning sweeter and gaining weight in the mouth, and finishing very fine. Loads of ripe, red and black fruits with notes of Bing cherry. This is one hell of a sexy Pinot Noir, and a terrific effort from Talley.
",Pinot Noir
"The nose of this wine is so complex, clove, Darjeeling tea, sandalwood and blackberry I had to go back and look at the price of this wine, really? $17.99? Holy Cow, you don’t get this in that price point. The palate has a supple richness to it that makes it so easy to drink, there on the palate the spice and blackberry come back but they aren’t candied sweet, they are fresh and faceted. The finish is superb, the richness is balanced by a lifting in the finish that cleans and focuses your palate. Really an outstanding wine at the price point.
",Pinot Noir
"An easy going pinot for any time of day; this San Luis Obispo pinot is fairly light in color and has a clean, fruity aroma. Much more depth on the palate, however, where a juicier mouth feel and mineral aftertaste present themselves. A sub-$20 California pinot you can be confident about.
",Pinot Noir
"An amazing, minerally rosé from a favorite producer, Franck Millet’s lean Rosé of Pinot Noir is crisp and sophisticated, with watermelon notes and an easygoing quality that pairs with everything from BBQ to spicy takeout. 2016 was a colder vintage, and you can feel that in this vivid release. While Sancerre is always a refreshing choice in the summer, this Direct Import has the longevity to drink well into the holiday season and beyond.

"Made from 100% Pinot Noir, this is delicious and crisp with ripe peaches, watermelon, stony minerality and Rainier cherry at its core.
",Pinot Noir
"As with the Rhone Valley’s Chateau de Montfaucon’s owner, UC Davis graduate Rodolphe de Pins, productions that we have been also importing for over twenty years, Franck Millet brought his production samples of Sancerres to Clyde on one of his buying trips to Bordeaux way back when to see if he could convince our fearless leader into directly importing his wines to K&L. And, as with Montfaucon, Clyde was so taken with the incredible quality of Millet’s wines, he had no choice but to do so. Initially it was strictly the Sauvignons from Millet that we brought in, but as our Rosé sales exploded five-plus years ago, Clyde made the wise decision to also begin including his Rosé. And, we are all glad he did. This 2016 has a striking pink hue about it, and offers a lovely perfume of current and strawberry, with just a hint of Chilean Jasmine floral notes. In the mouth, this gorgeous Gem is crisp and mouthwatering, yet rich, creamy, and dry, which leads to a bright, refreshing finish. This also continues the run of exceptional Rosés from them. The Bean and I see a bucket of steamed clams sitting in front of us to go with this excellent Gem, and has ordered me to bring home cases of this exceptional Rosé – plus, buckets of clams. Don’t miss this Gem! AN AMAZING ROSÉ VALUE!!! …..A K&L WINE MERCHANTS’ DIRECT IMPORT…..  ***** 12.5% ABV *****

"Really, really impressed by this recent collaboration with Au Bon Climat. The grapes for this wine are sourced from the famed Bien Nacido vineyard in the Santa Maria Valley. After some time decanting (preferably at least 30 minutes), this wine shines with the best of what California Pinot Noir has to offer. Aromas of tart bing cherries and red currants are accented by a bouquet of mulling spices, wet leaves, and balsam fir. On the palate, tart cranberries, bright red cherries, pomegranate, and fresh herbs dance on the palate with a wonderfully pleasant elevated acidity and crunchy texture. This is showing exceptional right now, but an additional 2-5 years could put this wine in a really special place. A great food pairing option with cedar plank salmon
",Pinot Noir
"As bold and expressive as Jim Clendenen’s haircut (or lack thereof), this single vineyard bottling of the Bien Nacido plots in Santa Maria Valley leapt of the glass to tell an intricate story. Immediate expressions of ripe berry pie which started with clearly defines summer blueberry and warm blackberries soon developed streaks of bright raspberries and a sense of terroir with dusty loam accents.  The legendary experience of the winemaker is apparent in the elegant mouth feel of your first sip which builds with good acidity as the blackberries takes center stage.  A fresh, mixed berry taste replaces the darker notes that showed on the nose delivering a brighter, round glass that finishes long.  White and black pepper hide in the corners but step into the light the longer you ruminate on this wine.
",Pinot Noir
"This is what I want from my Pinot Noirs!  The first note I wrote down while tasting this was ""yum"" - not exactly a tasting note but I was impressed.  This is so aromatic and enticing.  It's complex and lovely.  It's....just really good.  Along with the fruit and warm baking spice, I get what can be described as a ""clean earth"" note.  Like fresh potting soil.  It's like if you were planting peonies and pink roses in your garden with fresh, wet earth.  It's subtle, but I love me some clean earth and flowers in my wine.  I already love Au Bon Climat and the fact that I can get a ridiculous Pinot from a highly celebrated estate for under $20, makes this even better.  I might need one for decanting and drinking now, and one to lay down for a bit.
",Pinot Noir
"Au Bon Climat has always been one of my favorite California wineries, so I was excited when we started working on our own private label expressions. While I've enjoyed the previous two Pinot Noirs we bottled under the K&L label, the 2016 edition of the single vineyard ""Bien Nacido"" is by far the best of the bunch. We just need to give it 20 -30 minutes in the decanter before trying. Bien Nacido is one of our state's coveted sites for cool climate fruit, meaning the Pinot Noirs have more structure and acidity as a result. I can tell you from two empty bottles of experience that the difference a bit of air makes with this wine is night and day. After 20 minutes or so, you get everything you expect from a Burgundian-inspired Pinot Noir: crunchy red fruits, raspberry and hints of earth with lots of spice. I could easily be fooled into thinking this was a bottle of 1er Cru Burgundy (perhaps Pommard or Volnay) if poured blind. The best part is that Au Bon Climat's Bien Nacido release has historically been listed for $40 and over-delivers at that price.  At half that price...how can you pass this up?
",Pinot Noir
"This Pinot Noir could be easily mistaken for Burgundy when blind tasted. First thing that came to my mind when I tasted it was Pommard. Those violet notes, broad texture and linear bright acidity that forms very firm structure enveloped with dark red cherry and touch of red plum are so charming and appealing! Very impressive wine! To be honest it's been awhile since I've tasted Pinot Noir from California that would resemble Burgundy so much. I definitely need some of it for my cellar.
",Pinot Noir
"This is a powerhouse of a Pinot, and a fantastic value. Made from fruit sourced from some of Edna Valley's most extreme, cool climate vineyard sights, Wonderwall has a wonderful, lively acidity that plays against Its earthy, lush,darker fruit aromas and flavors. 35 year old Andrew Jones, winemaker and also proprietor to Alloy Wine Works and Fiction wines, has a keen sense of humor and history, and his labels are eye catching as the wines are delicious. Perfect for a vibrant gathering with friends!
",Pinot Noir
"This new vintage of Wonderwall has beautiful style and complexity, with scrumptious cherry, earth, baking spices and balanced acidity on the finish. This shows lovely restraint while still offering plenty of flavor. Another stellar wine from Andrew Jones!
",Pinot Noir
"Winemaker Andrew Jones may have only started making wines for his own label a decade ago, but his prior knowledge and experience working in and around almost every Central Coast vineyard has clearly given Andrew a leg up on the competition. The Wonderwall catalog focuses on Chardonnay and Pinot Noir from the most extreme vineyards that Andrew works with, creating wines of balance yet approachability. Super soft and charming up front, the Wonderwall slowly reveals its complexity in the layers of baking spice and sweet earth that come to the forefront with just a slight amount of air. This is the ideal holiday wine for all those fastidious guests who always expect the best.
",Pinot Noir
"This is the epitome of red Sancerre Pinot Noirs — great acidity, silky dark red fruit with a generous touch of earth and minerals.  It is part of a stellar line of wines that we’ve been importing for over 20 years from Franck and Betty Millet.  They seem to get better every year, and that seems particularly true for this 2015 vintage.

"If you like delicate, lighter-style red Burgundy that's aromatically oriented, this is a wine you must try. Despite the warmer vintage, this Burgundy has retained its elegance and light-bodied poise. This is a more classic expression of the region, combining crunchy cranberry and sweet baking spice with soft, fine tannin. This will easily be a favorite of mine once the warmer weather hits, and is perfect now with lighter dishes or all on its own.

"The wines of Savigny-lès-Beaune are some of the most affordable in all of Burgundy, as well as open-knit, charming, and accessible. They are the perfect choice for anyone just beginning to explore the region. This wonderful villages bottling from Domaine Jean-Michel Giboulot is an excellent example. As vintages go, 2015 is among the best, and the quality really shines through here. Notes of clove and cinnamon spice on the nose, along with a hint of violets. On the palate, a mix of red and black fruits, cherry and raspberry. There is ample ripeness here with good concentration, lively acidity and fine tannins. A superb effort, and a terrific value. Drink now, or over the next one to three years.
",Pinot Noir
"2015 Domaine Jean-Michel Giboulot Savigny-lès-Beaune is full of ripe bing cherry aromas. The palate is richly textured and layered with spice, dark cherry and plum, firm tannins and bright acidity. It shows ripeness of the vintage, yet stays restrained and well structured
",Pinot Noir
"The standard Savigny les Beaune from Giboulot is the most traditional of the 2015 bunch, with grittier tannins and more meaty flavors of earth and licorice. The ripeness of the vintage is still there, but it's much more restrained which allows the secondary flavors to shine through. Great for a simple dinner or roasted chicken.
",Pinot Noir
"Looking for the perfect reed Burgundy for under $30? You can stop the search because the 2015 Giboulot Savigny-les-Beaune is the new you've been looking for. Fantastic cherry fruit mingles with subtle spice and oak notes with dusty tannins and bright acidity. Giboulot is a name to look for when drinking your way thru Savigny-les-Beaune.

"The Giboulot wines are really showcasing the warmth and ripeness of the 2015 vintage in Burgundy. This Savigny-les--Beaune opens immediately with ripe wild cherry, sweet raspberry, and notes of darker berry with just a little earth. The body moves along with balancing acid, rich lovely red fruit and a grippy finish.
",Pinot Noir
"This is one of the darker, juicier Savigny Les Beaunes I have had the pleasure of tasting. Lots of black currants, plums and blueberry flavors with a hint of mocha fill the mouth and linger on the finish. Quite delicious!
",Pinot Noir
"The second vintage now from the producers of Banshee, for those who love the Pinot being grown in the Willamette valley. The Averaen showcases ripe fruit with hints of candy and cherry cola; these rich notes are balanced by acid and tannin. The richness that Banshee is known for is integrated into the structure that Pinot from this area is famous for. This is an instantly friendly and easy to love wine from people of whom we have long been fans. Overall this is a balanced and lovely Pinot Noir just in time for the holidays.
",Pinot Noir
"Once again Banshee and folks have knocked out of the ball park. The philosophy of growing grapes with sustainable practices and a hands-off wine making approach shows on this wine. The wine is lush and elegant and takes on the volcanic characteristic of its soil. Rustic, but rich on the palate, this Pinot Noir gives you all the talking points of spectacular Willamette pedigree. Ripe juicy cherries, a meaty earthiness and silky tannin can all be found, but the complexity of spice, cocoa, and quality of fruit are what impresses most.
",Pinot Noir
"Back in stock and even more delicious than before! This is a rockin' deal in Yarra Pinot Noir. The second label of our Direct Import partner Helen's Hill - this estate grown wine delivers more at $15 than many Pinots at twice that price.  Juicy, dark red fruits, warm earth, truffle, a lick of exotic spice. It has such a silky texture on the palate from the exceptional growing conditions of the 2015 vintage. This wine is super quaffable on its own but also has great natural acidity that makes it very versatile and food friendly.  This wine sold out very fast on our previous Helen's Hill offering...luckily the winery held us back some cases so we can now offer it again.
",Pinot Noir
"I've seen great pinots from the southern hemisphere for under twenty bucks over the last year, but not estate-grown pinot noirs. The fruit at Helen's Hill is meticulously cared for by Allan Halder, a guy who is as passionate about viticulture as anyone I've ever met. The Ingram pinot is not only full of pure pinot flavor, it's fresh and lively on the palate in a way that I wish more Bourgogne rouge value options were. If you're looking for that great bottle of village level Burgundy but don't feel like spending $20+ for an unknown, this is as close to a sure thing as I've ever seen at K&L. I'm thrilled to be working directly with Helen's Hill and I think were on the verge of something very big with this initial release.
",Pinot Noir
"Cherries, wild strawberries, subtle spice with a lovely dusting of earth on the nose. Round ripe fruits greet you immediately on the palate, all ripe red berries.  A dusting of oak and spice on a clean and easy finish.  Way more expressive than any CA Pinot at the same price point.
",Pinot Noir
"With the richer and riper flavors on Burgundy from the 2015 vintage this bottle is a wonderful reminder that there is still plenty of brightness and acidity to be had in the wine. The Francois Parent Haut Cotes De Nuits immediately greets you with fresh red berry and cherry notes. The flavor here is softly easy to enjoy, with enough complexity to make it interesting and not overwhelming. A very seriously easy to enjoy offering for those just coming to Burgundy.
",Pinot Noir
"This has plenty of freshness right out of the bottle along with bright red cherry aromas and flavors that soften toward the mid palate. Easy to drink and even easier to enjoy, this is a great fit for Carneros Pinot Noir fans. A winning addition to any dinner party, this will pair well with simple gougères or a succulent rotisserie chicken.
",Pinot Noir
"This is an outstanding value, even within the plethora of 2015 bargains that we've seen recently. While the Cote de Nuits region can be somewhat of a mixed bag, this bottle is absolutely stunning. The character is closer to that of a Gevrey-Chambertin, with just a touch of Chambolle-Musigny elegance. The wine has beautiful aromatics with a layered spice and earth component that plays off the deep black cherry fruit. Absolutely lovely now, but I'd bet on this developing incredibly well over the next few years if you're willing to put a few in your cellar!
",Pinot Noir
"One of the stars of our direct import program, the A2 ""White Label"" from Akitu offers exceptional value. A cornucopia of bright red fruits - cherry, cranberry, rhubarb, pomegranate - combine gracefully with floral and spice elements to form a nearly perfect wine. Some stem inclusion adds a savory element that complements the whole. Layer upon layer of flavor here to delight the senses. A real treat for the Pinot enthusiast, and a great example of the best that Central Otago has to offer.
",Pinot Noir
"A lovely, tremendously accessible bottle of New Zealand Pinot Noir. An inviting nose of cherries, plum, and red berries. A beautiful bouquet of dried herbs, baking spice, and lavender. On the palate, dark cherry aromas transition into red cherries flavors, along with juicy acidity and soft, supple tannins.  This wine’s soft nature and lively acid work tremendously well as a food accompaniment, particularly with poultry. If we are looking to pair with ethnic fare, this wine pairs wonderfully with Asian pork pot stickers or Siu Mai. Drinking well now; can cellar for an additional 3 -7 years
",Pinot Noir
"The White Label is one gorgeous bottle of Pinot Noir. Very accessible, and very aromatic- pretty, pretty, pretty. Red cherry, sweet strawberry, rose, spice and raspberry, with medium plus acidity and medium plus tannin. I just want to sit and savor every sip. Throw a party and make this your house Pinot Noir- you will not be disappointed!
",Pinot Noir
"The balanced, clean 2015 A2 from Akitu is a skillful blend from across their Wanaka estate. This is the kind of Pinot Noir that has the lift and refreshment for many different kinds of food, but is easy and delicious enough to have on its own. I love the dark fruit and the new leather flavors in this perfect example of Central Otago Pinot!
",Pinot Noir
"While Jacques Bavard has made a name for himself fashioning some amazing white wine bargains the 2014 Jacques Bavard Auxey Duresses Rouge proves he can masterfully craft red wines as well as whites. A beautiful nose of fresh red fruits, spice and subtle earth aromas mix with a supple palate featuring red cherry, cranberry and pomegranate fruit. Bright and zesty this is an ideal red for drinking tonight with roast chicken or lighter faire.
",Pinot Noir
"Showing pretty cola and spice notes on the nose, this wine is well-structured, with lively acidity and fine-grained tannin. A wine demonstrating great sense of terroir, this Auxey-Duresses shows plenty of earth and dark fruit characteristics. Though a bit young, it will undoubtedly resolve into a beautiful wine with some aging.
",Pinot Noir
"This vintage shows a bright cherry character, with fine-grained tannins, lovely perfume and spice along with a very red-fruited long finish. It is fresh and lively! Perfect wine for summer sipping and will pair well with a variety of food.
",Pinot Noir
"The DuMol Pinot Noir is the whole package. While previously the wines were about oak and extraction, today, it's all about balance, ageability and structure, without losing its signature fruit component. There is an elegant juxtaposition in this wine: the ripe approachability with the lifted, refine palate; the deep-seated black cherry and raspberry with the bright cranberry and pomegranate; the beautiful fragrant florality with the savory spice and sweet scorched earth aromatics. This is an exceptionally beautiful Pinot Noir that is sure to please at every holiday festivity.
",Pinot Noir
"There's a reason Dumol is considered one of the best producers of Russian River Pinot, and this bottling is a perfect example. First, it is strikingly ""of its place,"" showing richness and density without becoming too full or heavy, maintaining an effortlessly light touch - a defining trait of the best RRV Pinot. Second, the deep red and blue berries are ripe and vivid, but never too center-stage, allowing the layers of complexity underneath to rise to the surface. Some chamomile tea leaf, warm baking spice, and a hint of coriander round out the palate while the full malolactic fermentation renders a mouthwatering note of buttery pie crust. The acidity is streamlined and tannins are fine, making for a beautifully delineated, elegant Pinot Noir.
",Pinot Noir
"Maybe about seven years ago, I tasted a few of the bubblies from Loxarel at a trade show. Ever since then I have been hooked. I have consumed so many bottles across their dizzying array of products, and built up so much product conviction along the way, that I would put these up against any sparkling wines in the store. The 999 is quite a dry expression of high elevation Pinot Noir and Xarel-lo Vermell (red skinned mutation of the indigenous Xarel-lo and  a key component to most cava and sparkling Penedes wine). The wine is recently disgorged, stylish, and very easy to drink!
",Pinot Noir
"This wine gains its gorgeous ruby color by blending 60% Xarel-lo Vermell and 40% Pinot Noir. While it shows more fruity richness than the Refugi, this is still a Brut Nature and is utterly, refreshingly dry. Restrained strawberry, dried cranberry, tart citrus and orange peel all wash across the palate with a bracing acidity and tickling bubbles.
",Pinot Noir
"This is one of the tastiest, coolest, and most interesting rose bubbly we carry but unfortunately the label does not scream that. Still if you are willing to look past the label you can get into a wine by my favorite cava producers in our store. This is worlds away from a soft strawberry, watermelon and sweet finish. This wine is all tart earthy raspberry with plenty of acid and minerality. Dry finish with that seems to linger forever this is a ridiculously good bottle of bubbly in just a ridiculous package.
",Pinot Noir
"This is the Cava Rosé for the seekers, those who are tired of the fruity pink blandness of the sparkling rosé world. Loxarel brings us the 999 Brut Nature Rosat, made from high elevation, Biodynamically farmed Estate Pinot Noir and Xarel-lo Vermell, aged 12-14 months on the lees. Nutty, chalky aromas abound, with just the slightest hint of frozen raspberry, and the palate is absolutely bone dry, mineral driven and tangy, with wafts of white mushroom and slightly oxidized red apple.
",Pinot Noir
"Delicious rosé bubbly for under $15! Red apples and macerated berry aromas are the first notes I get, with a fun mineral bouquet that lingers. On the palate, a multitude of red fruit flavors like pomegranate and cranberry play with red apple once again. Crisp and tart on the finish, with beautiful elevated acidity. Like the winking owls on the label, it would be wise to pick up a couple bottles
",Pinot Noir
"I really enjoyed this bottling in the 2014 vintage and while I had good expectations about the wine, I was really pleasantly surprised when I tasted the new vintage. Beautiful fruit of red cherry and raspberry are indicative of the ripeness of the 2015 vintage. Although the fruit is showing nicely there is still plenty of acid and some lovely spice notes to balance everything out. Toward the finish there is a very fun somewhat hard minerality that helps to anchor the wine. All in all the balance was spectacular and everything in this wine worked together.
",Pinot Noir
"The wines at Faiveley have been improving dramatically over the past decade, though perhaps it takes a vintage as successful as 2015 to clearly illustrate how far these wines have come. Aromas and flavors of freshly pressed raspberries are friendly but not simple or one dimensional, just really tasty and satisfying. A fine Pinot Noir to drink now or cellar for several years.
",Pinot Noir
"Bar-none my favorite Kalinda offering to date. This is true Sonoma Coast pinot noir through and through. There's that agile, driving acid, a razor sharp focus, and an absolutely purity of fruit. This pinot noir holds its own against top shelf Sonoma Coast pinots and blows most of them out of the water--an unheard of feat for a wine at this price. Pinot noir fans take note: you need to try a bottle of this to believe it.
",Pinot Noir
"In an age where customers want to know every detail about what they're drinking, it's our job with the Kalinda label to find wines so delicious and well-priced that customers forget all about the specs and dive right into the bottle based on flavor alone. This 2015 Sonoma Coast pinot noir offers the essence of a true California expression with black cherry, spice, and balanced acidity thanks to the coastal breeze. We can't reveal our sources, but I can reveal to you that this wine is utterly delicious.
",Pinot Noir
"The Melville Estate is dedicated to the cultivation and sustainability of their cool climate vineyards, which are planted in several blocks on sandy soils. All sixteen clones of Pinot Noir planted at the estate are included in this wine, which creates exceptional complexity. There is 40 percent whole cluster in the fermentation, and as a result, the wine exhibits some Old World charm, with a slightly gamey and smoky undertone. What I really appreciated most about this wine was the way it opened up, like a fine Burgundy, over the course of the evening. With aromas of dried rose petal and cinnamon, and intriguing flavors of blood orange, cinnamon and ripe Bing cherry, this wine is a gem.
",Pinot Noir
"From one of the best parcels in Beaune,  Jean-Michel Giboulot has crafted one fantastic wine. Supple and fresh with crunchy cranberry, red cherry fruits, earthy notes, smooth tannins, and a finish that won't quit,  this is both refined and substantial -- such complexity! This is completely accessible now and has excellent aging potential, too. In fact,  I grabbed a few to put away for a few years -- and a few to consume this weekend.
",Pinot Noir
"This is a substantial yet balanced wine with hearty aromas of sweet dark fruit and just a slight whiff of oak.  The middle is layered with rich fruit, spice and a hint of game where the chewy texture is lifted by fresh acidity.
",Pinot Noir
"2015 Domaine Jean-Michel Giboulot Beaune 1er Cru ""Aux Clos du Roi"" is probably the fullest in body of all Giboulot wines. It’s supple and very approachable with soft tannins, black raspberry and black Tartarian cherry. But despite being rich it doesn’t lack fresh crunchy acidity and good backbone of spice.
",Pinot Noir
"This wine has gobs of black cherry notes on the nose and more of that fruit on the palate, but with more restraint than some of the juicier 2015s from Giboulot. The finish has loads of spice and just a hint of earth to counterbalance some of that fruit. This should age nicely.
",Pinot Noir
"This bottle takes a walk on the richer side of Rose. Dense and decadent, a core of Bing Cherry, cassis and blood orange, Rose to the fullest. The 18% of Pinot added as red wine adds a firm spine that runs from tip to tail, frambois and baking spice lend a dark richness.  Texturally incredibly please, supple and weighty with a finish that end with a hint of baking spice.
",Pinot Noir
"No Champagne is more famous within France than Ruinart, but it is only now that connoisseurs in the USA are starting to discover these great wines from Champagne. This rich, well balanced rose will delight fans of great pink Champagne with a great contrast between pure Pinot fruit and pure Champagne chalk. It is a blend of 55% Pinot Noir and 45% Chardonnay, with 18% of the Pinot vinified red and blended in for color and flavor. It has a little more color than most rose Champagne and a soft, full bodied texture. It is rich and satisfying, despite the deceptively high proportion of Chardonnay.
",Pinot Noir
"This is one of our richer styled Brut Rose champagnes. It has a lush nose of dark cherries, red fruit and rose petals. Full and rich on the palate with dark, red fruits and smokey notes. Rich and spicy, it will please nearly everyone.
",Pinot Noir
"This is no ordinary rose.  Yes, it is beautifully colored, has a great mouse, and is just too easy to drink but there is something else going on here as well.  In one word, complexity.  This is like drinking beautiful sparkling Burgundy.  Wonderful aromatics, multidimensional fruit, a round, generous mid-palate and great length, this is more than special occasion Champagne, this is indulgent, you deserve it, treat yourself (family and friends optional) Champagne!

"Thomas Fogarty Vineyards has been making quality wine for over thirty five years in the Santa Cruz Mountains. They are devoted to practicing organic and biodynamic farming in order to preserve the land for generations to come. All of their wines are expressive, but the 2013 Pinot Noir stood out to me. Fresh raspberries, a touch of elegant wood is accompanied by bright acid and a long dry finish. Beautiful floral tones and a touch of earthiness round out this stellar wine.
",Pinot Noir
"This Pinot Noir from Thomas Fogarty screams Santa Cruz Mountain terroir. It is a blend of 8 different locations that are all estate and include cool mountain and maritime climates. Lean and fresh, this wine shows flavors of red cherries, plum, rose and some dried herb. With an alcohol level of just 13.1%, this super drinkable Pinot is a rare find among other big, ripe California Pinots.
",Pinot Noir
"This is an elegant Pinot with old world intrigue. Sourced from vineyards that range from 400-2,600 feet in elevation and planted on shale soil, the wine has an expansive, smooth and clean palate, with a gamy and spicy undertone. Fermented with naturally occurring yeasts, the wine reflects the Santa Cruz mountain terroir, with rocky minerality and Bing and black cherry aromas and flavors.
",Pinot Noir
"Do not let the fact that this is the “entry level” Fogarty Pinot Noir fool you. This is outrageous wine, entirely under-valued and full of Pinot greatness. From numerous estate and non-estate sites Tom Jr. and Nathan Kandler have quilted together a wildly expressive wine that speaks of the Santa Cruz Mountains. From numerous sub-regions of the appellation this includes fruit that was grown from 400-2,600 feet elevation and that mountainside structure pulls this wine along seamlessly. Light, tangy and full of crunchy, red fruited snap it is worth the price of admission just to experience the playful tension between ripe pomegranates, plum and white cherry fruit and the zesty acid that Pinot Noir is known for from the area. But then comes the loaded finish that has chaparral, white floral and sage components that will leave you wanting glass after glass. In the world of crazy priced Pinot Noir these days this wine strikes out as something incredibly special.
",Pinot Noir
"Many of our best values in Pinot Noir come from NZ these days, a product of our direct import program, a favorable exchange rate, and the frankly unbelievable quality of the wines being produced there these days. A superb example is the 2016 Ribbonwood Marlborough Pinot Noir from Framingham. Generous red and black fruits with a savory/smoky edge and a hint of oak. Delicious.
",Pinot Noir
"This is an excellent value in Pinot Noir. Marlborough is a world-class area for Pinot, but surprisingly, you can still find stunning values here as well. This wine is bright, medium bodied, full of lovely, clean, red berry fruit with just a hint of clove spice. The tannins are very fine and the acidity, while quite crisp, is well-integrated to the whole.
",Pinot Noir
"Named after New Zealand's tallest native deciduous tree, Ribbonwood vineyard in Marlborough was first planted in 1998, and produces Pinot Noir that is unusually expressive and aromatic. Both smoky and lush, but with herbaceous and decidedly rosy aromas and flavors, this Pinot is certain to evoke imagery of a more peaceful, far off place that also practices 100% environmentally sustainable farming. Here's to the years to come.
",Pinot Noir
"Another fantastic Pinot Noir I thoroughly enjoyed from the Marlborough region. The nose has hints of tobacco and ripe fruit notes while the palate is savory, bright and short, with a delicious finish. A must-try for Pinot Noir lovers out there!
",Pinot Noir
"This wine lives up to its Reserve designation.  It has everything that you could want or expect from Willamette aromatics and fruit tones.  Where it differentiates itself is texture.  It has super polished tannins, giving the wine extra presence without being distracting.  It fills your palate with deliciousness and then effortlessly glides onto a lengthy finish.  Definitely worth a try.
",Pinot Noir
"Straightforward Willamette Valley Pinot with lovely notes of cherry, smoke, mushroom and spice. Plenty of bright acid to support. It is refreshing, flavorsome and very worthy of your consumption.
",Pinot Noir
"This is Willamette Valley, long and balanced with delicate sweet raspberry tart cherry intermixing with floral notes and a long finish. Argyle is one of those wineries that I can always count on to make quality Pinot Noir and this just continues that tradition.
",Pinot Noir
"The beauty of Willamette shines through in this Pinot with aromas of smoke and violets. The palate provides a mix of crunchy red fruits and dark fruits with lovely tobacco spice, slate-like minerality and spice.
",Pinot Noir
"A classic Willamette Pinot Noir from a supremely drinkable vintage at a great price, the 2014 Argyle Reserve shows crunchy raspberry and deeper plum fruit, with lifted acid and subtle smokiness on the silky finish. Expressive and terroir-driven, this is both serious and accessible.
",Pinot Noir
"Delicate, unobstructed fruit leaning slightly towards the red varieties, hints of tobacco, and great balance make this wine delicious.
",Pinot Noir
"The Reserve Pinot Noir is a blend from three volcanic vineyard sites and the volcanic soil is ever-present in this bright, lifted, high acid Pinot Noir. Racy red cherry, rhubarb and strawberry on the nose make way for a lively tart palate of hibiscus, sweet earth and ripe raspberry.  Argyle is always a perennial staff favorite and for good reason! 
",Pinot Noir
"I tasted this and didn't know the price until just before writing this. It's definitely WAY cheaper than I thought it would be. I was expecting a $35-$40 price tag for this reserve Pinot.The first thing that strikes you is that it looks like Pinot Noir and not Cabernet like so many Pinot's today. It's a rich ruby red, but still markedly translucent. The aromatics are powerful: loads of cherry and cranberry tangle with the earthier side of the spectrum. Like a forest full of dew, wild herbs, and fresh, savory mushrooms. The palate is friendly and inviting, but with a nice acid cut. The soft fruit is delicious and the velvety texture pleasing. The lengthy finish is clean and bright. All in all an excellent value for high quality Pinot Noir!
",Pinot Noir
"Delicious wine from a superb vintage, this 2014 Argyle Pinot Noir is firing on all cylinders. Beautiful floral and mild herbal aromas show as the wine hits your glass. Bing cherry, raspberry and oak spices on the medium palate, with moderate tanin, plus a solid mineral vein and earthen quality from the intriguing volcanic soils balancing out this fantastic Pinot. Argyle continues their long run of top notch Pinot Noir with this offering!
",Pinot Noir
"Argyle's known for their fabulous sparkling wines from Willamette Valley but they also make delicious Pinot Noir. The fruit for this wine comes from three of Argyle's estate vineyards and showcases the warm 2014 vintage with vibrant fruit flavors and great balance. The nose is expressive with fresh red cherries, plum, smoky oak and earthiness. Super smooth on the palette with good acid balance, this Pinot is a great one to try! 
",Pinot Noir
"This wine is absolutely stunning just to look at in the glass! It's a gorgeous crimson and violet color that hypnotizes you instantly while you pour it. That's a good thing, however, because the 2014 Argyle Reserve needs about 15 minutes to open up before it really starts to show you what it's got. It's a good idea to just stare at your glass for a bit. When the air opens it up, the wine is textbook Willamette through and through: raspberry notes with hints of forest floor that are fortified by the bright acidity and somewhat firm tannins. It's the whole package for those curious as to what Oregon offers. Don't let the screw cap fool you either - this is a wine that can easily lay down in the cellar for a few years. Oregon pinot fans should be thrilled either way. This is a serious pinot noir that can be decanted for dinner tonight or stored away for a celebration down the line.
",Pinot Noir
"Dark purple fruit, balance, generosity, easy drinking goodness - what else does one need?...bada bing!
",Pinot Noir
"This Calera Central Coast Pinot Noir is consistently one of the, if not the, best ""entry level"" Pinots in the game! Sourced from incredible vineyards across the coast (Bien Naciedo, Laetitia, Solomon Hills among others), this Pinot shows fresh picked cranberry and Bing cherry, pretty herbal notes, and mild toast on the finish. Both of the central coast offerings in 2014 are incredibly strong and not to be missed!
",Pinot Noir
"For their 2014 vintage, Calera received Pinot Noir from some of best vineyards sites along the central coast and you can definitely tell. On the nose, this wine is full of aromatic red berries, rose petals and spices along with an earthy mid-palette bringing this wine to another level of  complexity. The juicy and savory elements balance each other very nicely and I can't wait to pair this with a salmon or pork dish!
",Pinot Noir
"One of the greatest Pinot producers delivering a great value for under $30. While light in color, there is definitely a full-bodied mouthfeel to this wine. Floral and spice notes on the nose give this wine an interesting complexity before the first sip. There are hints of red cherries and cranberries with a nice clean finish. Definitely worth adding to your Pinot lineup.
",Pinot Noir
"This is just plain fun. A crowd pleasing Brut Rose that would be perfect for all occasions. Light strawberries, fresh raspberries, and watermelon are all harmoniously wrapped together, while the fresh acid and tight bubbles do all the work.

"Poised upon the glistening foothills of the Pyrenees, far from the grandiose heart of Champagne, the immaculate, low-yielding, organic vineyards of Jean Louis Denois continue to produce superlative wines for a third the price of their uppity northern cousins. Bright, fleshy and expressive, this Brut rosé is the embodiment of charm and  merriment, with red fruits and berries that open lavishly upon the palate and finish clean and crisp and dry. A wonderful sparkler at a great price, guaranteed to deliver and entice!
",Pinot Noir
"This neat little sparkling wine is what I like to think of as ""baby Champagne"". It is a great crowd-pleaser with bright raspberry and strawberry fruit. Nice, easy bead with a nice finish of light minerals and chalk.
",Pinot Noir
"High quality and a low price make this one of the funnest bottles of bubbles available!  Made from 100% Pinot Noir, it has great structure and rich flavors of strawberries, raspberries and cherries. It has a rich, creamy mousse and a dry, crisp acidic finish.  Credit to Denois for making good everyday bubbles a possibility!
",Pinot Noir
"Another favorite is the Pinot Noir Brut Rosé. I always connect with this wine, with its light red cherry notes, spices and hint of cinnamon.  The mousse is creamy and the finish long.  This is great for any occasion.
",Pinot Noir
"Stunning at this price! Thanks once again to our direct import, this little brut rose is a steal. Crisp, bright cherry, strawberry, and well balanced acidity. Perfect party pick!

"Jean Louis Denois makes exceptional sparkling wines. His Pinot Noir Rose is no exception. It has a nice pink color and  energetic bubbles. There are bright juicy flavors and this sparkling wine is dry. Very festive.
",Pinot Noir
"Delightful bubbly, brimming with strawberry and raspberries, still quite dry, but with a full flavor.
",Pinot Noir
"Jean-Louis Denois' latest release of this 100% pinot noir sparkling wine is his best ever. Delicate and dry, with just a hint of red berry nuance and pinot spice, it finishes dry, crisp and clean. It is my go to sparkling rosé.

"This is always the first wine from Denois to disappear.  Good mouse and great pinot flavor can you ask for more? Yes, and reasonably priced!
",Pinot Noir
"Composed of 100% Pinot Noir, Denois' sparkling rose is made in the traditional method with the same care and attention given his other bruts. Also a direct import, this new rose is a real treat, with juicy strawberry and fresh watermelon aromas and flavors adding a whole new layer of fun to its creamy mousse and delicate honeyed toast foundation. A kiss of framboise adds impact to finish. A delicious and refreshing sparkler, this will complement many foods and bring an inspiring burst of color and flavor to any occasion!
",Pinot Noir
"This is exactly the kind of Pinot Noir that I love having piled around the house. This example from La Honda is simultaneously savory and energetic with a persistence and juiciness that begs another sip. It has plenty of stuffing and a certain seriousness to the profile, but this bottle doesn't depend on cellaring to shed superficial baby fat. I find that to be a rare virtue, not a knock. The complexity here is really highlighted by the wine's purity. Such is the virtue of the Santa Cruz Mountains, which experienced particularly low yields of exceptionally high quality Pinot Noir in 2015. This bottle is equally fun for the SCM geek, or as a ""gateway"" wine for the uninitiated to get into the region's Pinots for a steal of an entry fee.
",Pinot Noir
"Highly perfumed crushed red berries. Brambly fruit, orange peel, Christmas cake spice. Lifted aromas of Redwood grove and fresh rain. Pure, long, elegant on the palate, weighing in at 13.7% alc. A lovely combination of fresh fruit and savory forest floor notes. It finishes clean, supple and bright with moreish acidity.
",Pinot Noir
"I was intrigued at first by the latest vintage of Domaine de la Côte not because of it's reviews from the American press, but rather due to its massive 97 point score from the British-based Decanter magazine. The Brits tend to celebrate classic, true-to-form wines rather than big, brash, in-your-face pomposity and I was curious as to why they were lavishing a California Pinot Noir with such praise. Then I realized that Domaine de la Côte was Raj Parr's estate, the former wine director for the Mina Group and renowned sommelier who spearheaded his own old world project in the Santa Rita Hills. The domaine is collection of vineyards that makes up more than 60 acres on a south-facing slope at about 700 feet, roughly seven miles from the Pacific Ocean. The Santa Barbara area has long been a Mecca for California winemakers looking for cooler climates to grow Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. Tasting the 2014 Santa Rita Hills expression (a blend of all the estate vineyards), you could tell you were getting serious Pinot Noir just by looking at the color in the glass. Lighter in hue (classic Côte de Beaune rouge), lower in alcohol at 12.5%, and aromatic on the nose, I could have been easily fooled had someone passed this off as French. The wine has tremendous acidity, concentration of crunchy red fruits, and real old world character. Sometimes it's hard to remember that Pinot Noir like this is still being made in California! Those of you looking for a mid-range Thanksgiving dinner option might want to snatch this up while we have it at this price. American made with a nod to the Côte d'Or.
",Pinot Noir
"This is a stellar sub twenty dollar Pinot Noir from the Willamette Valley. Concentrated cherries and raspberries are lightly dusted with winter baking spices. The palate is broad and silky, while the balanced acid gives the wine lift. A long elegant finish completes the wine.
",Pinot Noir
"This is one of Domaine Serene's entry-level wines that comes from their estate vineyards in Willamette Valley's Dundee Hills, Eola-Amity Hills and Yamhill Carlton. The cuvée is very approachable and intended for near-term consumption. Ripe red fruits, dried herbs and dark chocolate are expressed on the nose while the palate unfolds more layers of spice and coffee. Fresh and silky on the palate, this wine will please many Pinot Noir lovers!
",Pinot Noir
"The moment I tasted this red Burgundy from Domaine Parent, I knew this would be a perfect bottle for Thanksgiving. The palate finishes smoothly with a cranberry taste that really makes me want to have turkey and everything else you would enjoy for Thanksgiving.
",Pinot Noir
"The 2015 reds from Domaine Parent are utterly charming wines made with restraint and balance, with just the right concentration of fruit. A Bourgogne rouge is often a sign of a winemaker’s chops, and the simple 2015 Domaine Parent Bourgogne Pinot Noir is full of dark, juicy fruit with gentle tannins and a clean, elegant finish.
",Pinot Noir
"Though still on the light side (it is Pinot Noir, after all), I find the Carpe Diem to have just a bit more texture than most Pinot Noirs of it's caliber. These added dimensions are beautifully obvious on the nose, where aromas of cool strawberry pie pull you in immediately. Likewise on the palate, the extra texture is super smooth, but doesn't disappear without making some it's delicate nuances known. Perfect for Pinot fans who need something with a touch more weight for a meal or Merlot/Cabernet fans who want something a bit lighter.

"The Carpe Diem Pinot Noir is classic Anderson Valley Pinot Noir. There is a beautiful wave of ripe, red strawberry and cherry that pops on the fuller-than-expected palate. And while there's a touch more weight than usual, the Carpe Diem has a bright, playful mouthfeel that is matched by lively baking spices and rose petals on the palate. This is a fun, inexpensive Pinot that will delight at every holiday occasion this season!
",Pinot Noir
"The 2014 Vintage of Carpe Diem is very well balanced, and a perfect expression of Anderson Valley Pinot. Tasting this bottle reminded me of what I loved so much about Anderson Valley in first place. With notes of cranberry, cherry and a touch of cinnamon, this bottle should go perfectly with any dinner scenario for the light bodied red drinker.
",Pinot Noir
"If I wanted to trick someone in a blind tasting, I would pour this and watch them guess Pinot Noir from Burgundy. This wine is very delicate with a pleasant amount of strawberry fruit that is rounded out with hints of clove and spice. This is a crisp, nearly tart wine that is perfect for the upcoming holiday dinners.
",Pinot Noir
"Pinot Noir from the McCreanor vineyard famous for its deep, gravely subsoil; Te Rehua is a fruit forward wine that experienced 12 days of punch down and then matured gracefully in only 30% new French oak.  Black cherries and an undercurrent of rocky mineral are braced with firm, mature tannins that helps the wine find its balanced expression in a long unctuous finish.
",Pinot Noir
"The nose has intense but cool red fruits that are barely framed by a fine but faint cocoa dust and subtle oak spice note.  With a little time a diffused savory herbal note appears behind the fruit.  It is a fairly big Pinot with richness and great mid-palate texture.  The fruit commands your attention, it puts the oak and tannin in their place, on the periphery.  It is not a ""fruity"" wine but the fruit has intensity.  A dry lingering finish where the oak spice and savory elements build on the finish.  This is a very impressive Pinot.
",Pinot Noir
"I'm so excited that we have another vintage of Kalinda Anderson Valley Pinot Noir back in stock! Even better than the last vintage, this wine comes to us from a North Coast legend. Loaded with fruit, the ripe cherries mesh with fresh cranberry and even a darker blackberry note. Cola shines through on the nose and palate. The tannins are very soft and polished and play beautifully with the pop and freshness of the wine. This screams Anderson Valley - the big diurnal shifts in temperature contribute to both ripeness and fresh acidity.
",Pinot Noir
"I can't tell you how nice it is every once and a while to taste a classic cool climate California pinot noir with a nice little zip of acidity. With bramble fruit rather than soft cherry. With savory herbs rather than sweet baking spices. The latest installment in the Kalinda series is a quintessential Anderson Valley pinot noir that should serve as a reminder to domestic drinkers than California pinot extends far beyond Sonoma, Santa Cruz, and the Central Coast. Those who want something in between Oregon and Burgundy need not look outside the state. We've got it all here in the Golden republic and this wine has it all going on as well. Black fruits with real tartness, earth and subtle forest floor. This is a  terroir-driven cuvee for a great price thanks to our Kalinda label.
",Pinot Noir
"Strawberry, spice, fresh cherry, red rose with medium-plus acidity. Food-friendly and would be a very pretty addition to your Thanksgiving table!
",Pinot Noir
"The Charles rosé has the honest toast that comes from extended lees contact and very high quality, subtle dark cherry fruit from the still red wine added to the blend. The best thing about the wine is that this rich toasty character is balanced perfectly with top class chalky drive on the back end. Pairing it with ginger garlic chicken, the Champagne had the vinous power to match the assertive flavors of the dish, and the cut to refresh the palate after each rich bite. I love rosé Champagne that can provide both richness, dark fruit flavor and top class refreshment--this Rosé Reserve from Charles Heidsieck delivers it all!
",Pinot Noir
"The first thing that is striking about this champagne is the light, almost orange colour that you see in the glass. Very, very attractive! On the nose, gobs of strawberry and blood orange scents. On the palate, strawberry, raspberry and cream. Lingering finish with good acidity.
",Pinot Noir
"Evening Lands Winery is a partnership between famed wine maker Sashi Moorman and famed sommelier Rajat Parr. The Seven Springs Vineyard is dry-farmed, is Live certified and was converted to biodynamic viticulture in 2007. The 2014 Seven Springs Pinot Noir comes from vines planted in 1984. These 31-year-old vines are harvested by hand, the grapes hand sorted, and roughly 65% of the fruit was destemmed. There is a wonderful purity to this wine. I would not call it light, but delicate, as Pinot should be. Flavors of strawberry, minerals, tobacco, spice fill the glass. This is a delicious food wine that can and should be enjoyed now.
",Pinot Noir
"Drinking supremely fresh and inviting is the ""Les Deux Terres"" or ""the two lands"" which is a perky and delicious blend of 75% Cru Beaujolais and 25% Bourgogne rouge. With notes of black cherry and clove spice, the entry displays bright ripe red fruits, but has enough structure and layers to please even the most skeptical Gamay drinker.  A super pick for your next picnic!
",Pinot Noir
"Produced mostly from vineyards from the cooler North Coast and Central Coast appellations {Sonoma Coast, Anderson Valley, Monterey, and Santa Barbara} from a vintage that most of you know I feel as being a sensational vintage for Pinot Noir, this second label production from Banshee Vineyards is perhaps the best they have created since we have started from the very beginning carrying this wine several years ago. Native yeast fermented and aged ten months in both stainless steel {45%} and French oak {55% of which 10% was new}, and very reflective of this superior, low crop yield vintage, this lovely Pinot shows an excellent rich appearance and deep robe of medium to medium-deep ruby color, with a distinctive perfume of a violet floral to black cherry to plummy quality, with mild undertones of a forest floor to wet river stone quality. Following through well into its soft, silky, round palate impressions, this gorgeous, near-term drinker has a defined, weighty, yet juicy mid-range, excellent integration and a long, nicely definitive finish. Again, this is a near-term production, with Rusty wanting me to bring home several cases of this Gem for our enjoyment over the next couple of years. A NICELY DRINKING VALUE! ***** 13.9% ABV *****
",Pinot Noir
"“Complexity”, “texture”, and “structure” are stated goals of famed winemaker Larry McKenna for his Escarpment wines and “Kupe” is where he reached perfection on all three.  Immediately out of the glass the wine draws you in with bold, dark cherry fruit notes that have an added depth of toasted quince zest which leave your eyebrows raised as you go back in for more.  Blackberries and limestone greet you for round two and compel you for a confirming first sip.  Balanced and mouth filling, the complexity of the nose is completed on the palate as the wine adds spicy echoes into the finish.
",Pinot Noir
"There's delicious, juicy, easy drinking Pinot Noir and then there's serious Pinot Noir like the 2014 Mindego Ridge. What does ""serious"" mean? It means balance and beauty with layers of flavor that slowly develop and unveil themselves after time in the glass. The dark and brooding fruit of the Santa Cruz Mountains is the star, of course, but under that there are hints of herbs and spice that begin on the nose and continue unwind as your swirl and sip your way through the glass. It's everything I love about Santa Cruz Mountain wines: mystery and intrigue with fresh acidity. The Mindego Ridge wines are from a tiny family-owned estate property, making this all the more fun to drink. It's rare that I find new Pinots from Santa Cruz these days that wow me, but this is another great find.
",Pinot Noir
"I love how both of the 2014 offerings from Mindego Ridge offer up a perfect synthesis of varietal and place. The Pinot Noir immediately communicates is terroir of coastal mountains, coniferous forests and pacific ocean breezes. The wine has such a delicate yet distinctive perfume: crunchy black and red berries, mulling spices, pine needles, fruitcake.  One the palate the wine is concentrated but focused, it has feeling of small, tight, clusters of fruit and a perfect balance of ripeness and acidity. Whilst the fruit expression is pure Pinot Noir, I also love that this wine embraces just a dash of the varietals savory side; there's bramble, forest floor and slatey minerals. Such a complete, complex and compelling wine that continues evolving with every sip.
",Pinot Noir
"Very nice floral aromatics and sure... It is completely dry on the delicate palate. Reminiscent of a Sancerre rosé. The cool label sure makes it stand out in a crowded rosé line up these days.
",Pinot Noir
"I always love when we do a Champagne tasting and today's was especially fun, tasting through some of our best values in the category.  This bottle was a definite winner for me and one of my favorites in the lineup!  The nose is so lovely and I just kept bringing the glass up to smell it again and again.  It's floral and fresh.  There's a note of cherry blossoms, saline, crisp green apples and crunchy red pears.  The palate is so clean and has a really nice creaminess.  What a beautiful Champagne for an amazing price! I'll definitely be taking this home to dive into this bottle a little further.
",Pinot Noir
"While all of Brochet’s wines impress, my favorite is probably the complex Premier Cru Brut, composed of 75% Pinot Noir, 20% Chardonnay and 5% Pinot Meunier with over 50% reserve wines. The cépage reflects the varietal makeup of the family’s 32-acre vineyard in Écueil, and the larger percentage of Pinot Noir makes this release especially aromatic. Beeswax on the nose with apple and stone fruit through the palate and a super-creamy mouthfeel, the elegant Brut opens up to reveal earthier umami flavors. It’s sumptuous but finishes refreshingly dry and subtly herbal. Aged over two years on the lees and only recently disgorged, it’s cellared for as long as the house’s two oenologists deem optimal. The quality for the money here is remarkable.
",Pinot Noir
"This is an absolutely outstanding new addition to our direct import portfolio, one that practically leaps out of the glass and excites just about every part of the palate. It's brimming with citrus, but it's also slightly nutty and creamy, just enough to balance out the acidity of all lemony goodness. It's like a perfectly balanced Sidecar or Bees Knees cocktail, just in Champagne form. My new favorite Champagne in the store and a bottle I'll definitely be putting in many, many hands.
",Pinot Noir
"This is composed of 80% Pinot Noir, 15% Chardonnay and 5% Meunier and dosed at 9 grams per liter. The blend is half reserves, with 35% from the previous two harvests and 15% from the solera that Louis started in 2010. The red cherry power of top Pinot Noir jumps from the glass and is framed by classy sourdough toast. I love the texture of this lighter style Pinot based Champagne, and the very high proportion and quality of reserve wines give it great texture, a fine bead and elusive complexity. This is hard to beat at the price!
",Pinot Noir
"One of the great new finds from our Champagne Buyer Gary Westby and we in Hollywood couldn't be happier.  The Brut is so generous it just opens with pretty fruit flavors, balancing acidity, toasty notes and  gorgeous accessibility.  Such a pleasure to drink with food and just on its own.  And for $30?!?  This will not last long!!

"One of the newest projects by Domaine Drouhin Oregon, is the Roserock wines. These wines come from a newer vineyard acquisition for Domaine Drouhin, but the vineyard itself is one of the oldest in the area. Planted back in the 1970's, this site now has fully mature vines and the quality of the fruit is fantastic. Combined with the passion and poise of the wine-making from Domaine Drouhin, the resultant wine is very dynamic. I'm a huge fan of this new label by Drouhin, and would highly recommend the wine to anyone looking for the best Oregon has to offer.

"The 2016 ""Crimson"" marks the first time we've carried the Ata Rangi mark here at K&L and I couldn't be more impressed with it as a side companion to the grand cuvee. In no way is this wine superfluous or simply a lesser version of its legendary mainstay. The Crimson is a darker, fleshier, and more supple Pinot Noir on every level, more like a Pommard or Volnay to the classic Ata Rangi's Richebourg. It's a juicy Pinot Noir that's almost daring you to put lay it down in your cellar, as if to say: ""You really think you can resist?"" It's that good already!
",Pinot Noir
"The Bondi Home Ranch  is  mid-weight and has a lot of  subtle flavors that are refreshing and vibrant. Nice dark berry that shows some weight,  cedar wood, tea and light cinnamon and cardamom. If you lay this baby down for a short nap, when it wakes up you should have a beauty on your hands.
",Pinot Noir
"During our recent Sonoma trip, we stopped at Martinelli to check out their current releases and the Bondi Home Ranch Pinot was a true standout. Full of baking spices and herbal tea, this Pinot is a bit more savory but still has beautiful fruit components like boysenberry jam and is super silky in texture. Delicious!
",Pinot Noir
"I poured this Martinelli Pinot Noir at a public tasting last weekend and everyone went crazy for it. The thing I love about this pinot noir is how adaptable it is to everyone's palate and preferred style. People who like a little upfront fruit will like it. People who like a touch of toastiness will like it. People who like a little bit of secondary aromatics will like it. People who like structure will like. This pinot noir fits all of the above. Loaded with beautiful exotic wood and savory spice notes, the dark brooding fruit on the palate gives way to even more savory notes and crushed floral elements on the finish. I'm always looking for a wine to go with every occasion and every crowd and I just found my wine!

"Bernard Gros of Domaine Gros Frere et Soeur, son of Jean Gros, carries the torch and tradition of crafting high quality Burgundies into the new millenium. The Borgogne Hautes Cotes De Nuits is a lighter, more transparent expression of the region with an elegant acidity, but reflects the ripeness of the vintage with notes of violet, raspberry, and spiced bing cherry. This is an excellent dinner companion, and will stand up to richer dishes in the colder months to come, but will also make a great apéritif!
",Pinot Noir
"The Domaine de Chezeaux wines are one of the best values in Burgundy. Considering that they also produce the Ponsot wines, you can hardly go wrong with any of their selections. I was most impressed with their 2015 Griotte Chambertin. The wine, of course, is built to age with a ponderous structure, but the fruit and spice elements are also in perfect balance. Even at this young stage, the wine is elegant, with refined wild cherry, clove, and a savory element that I can only attribute to the soil of the vineyard. All in all, a wine well worth investing in.
",Pinot Noir
"I love this wine, especially for the price! This has everything you could ever want in a top-flight 1er cru Burgundy. The nose is alive with notes of bright red berry, spice and that tell-tale cola note all fine Gevrey-Chambertins have. Layer after layer of complex fruit notes mingle with spice and earth notes to create a breathtaking Gevrey-Chambertin. There's a powerful core of fruit, tannin and acidity here and even though this is showing well now, I have to believe we are still just scratching the surface of what this wine will eventually reveal. A great showing for one of the first 2016s to reach our shelves.

"Sitting on terraced land above the banks of the Huangarua River, the Cleland Vineyard is the rocky, well drained birthplace of the “Kiwa” Pinot Noir.  The 2014 bottling is strikingly balanced starting with ripe black cherries, streaks of raspberry and an earthy, composted leaf terroir folded into the background. A long savory finish gives you pause as you anticipate the next sip.
",Pinot Noir
"Another beautiful vintage of Mongeard-Mugneret's Fixin! In the last few years, I've become enamored of this producer, particularly their wines from the lesser-known villages, such as Fixin. Not only does the wine display great depth of fruit, a polished character, and fine-boned tannin, but its elegance and balance is truly remarkable. There are layers of fruit, spice, earth, and savory elements here, all poised to deliver a truly remarkable wine.

"In my humble opinion, the most underrated sparkling on the market is the Roederer Estate Anderson Valley Brut Rosé Sparkling Wine ($24.00). There’s a touch more Chardonnay in the rosé than in the brut, and the Chardonnay clearly shows itself in the soft, creamy texture and elegance of this cuvee. The Pinot Noir helps round out the rosé  with a delicate berry fruitiness that is balanced with a zippy blood orange finish.  And while this elegant and delicious rosé  is the perfect sparkling wine to bring to any holiday occasion, be prepared to bring two because it will go fast!
",Pinot Noir
"From the first sparkly sip, you can tell that the 100% estate-grown Roederer Estate Brut Rosé is special. Full of texture, creaminess, and super effervescence, with orange and bright cherry fruit, this is a fresh rosé with a dry, almost pithy finish.
",Pinot Noir
"This is a very pretty wine with good length to the finish and nice lift to the aromatics.  Quite earthy but wonderfully transparent and beautifully fresh.
",Pinot Noir
"This is a classic expression of Cote de Nuits Villages Burgundy in 2014 - firmly structured with a lot of power right now and depth. It has bright ripe red cherry with forest floor aromas and long savory finish. This is perfect Burgundy to put away in your cellar.
",Pinot Noir
"Escarpment pours every ounce of passion they have into making wines at every level: hand plunging in open topped ferment followed by a gentle pressing ensures striking wines that compel you to dive deeper into the glass. A final kiss of French oak (25% new) for only 11 months finishes the wine to a master’s perfection. Dark rich fruit from the long hang time in 2014 is augmented by an earthy collage of mineral tones driven by the alluvial soils that speak clearly in this bottling.  Ripe tannins define the structure in the long finish as you anticipate your next sip.

"I'm extremely excited to announce the inaugural release of our favorite value Oregon Pinot Noir in the best possible package for easy and efficient summer sipping! Yes people, it's in a can! But don't let that fool you, it's the same juice that goes into the 2013 750ml bottle. Union Wine Co. orders labeled empty cans in quantity. This allows more flexibility with future cannings and makes sure they don't end up with unused vintage-specific cans. This is very similar to the beloved 2012 vintage that flew out of here before we could take a breath between sips! It has gorgeous aromatics of bright red and purple fruit--strawberry and pomegranate--with great texture and supple acid on the palate, pepper spice and a mineral finish. Serve with a slight chill and be the star wherever this summer takes you, whether it be camping, boating, picnicking, beaching or the Hollywood Bowl this year!

"This bottling from Au Bon Climat derives its name from winemaker Jim Clendenen’s son, Knox. The fruit for this wine is sourced from the finest lots of the estate Le Bon Climat and Bien Nacido Vineyard. Jim spent many years learning winemaking in Burgundy, and it’s therefore no surprise that this wine has a very distinct Burgundian soul. Aromas of dark cherry, ripe delicious apple, and white pepper are complemented with an earthy undertone of potting soil and bushes. On the palate, notes of raspberry and red cherry come to the table, followed by cocoa powder and soft vanilla. This wine’s texture is well balanced, with silky tannins being complimented by elevated acidity. It opens up quite nicely after decanting. A fantastic food pairing wine; would be perfect with Chinese Five-Spice rubbed duck breast
",Pinot Noir
"Au Bon Climat consistently makes exceptional wines that embody their terroir with precision and elegance. The fruit picked for this bottling is from the best blocks from their most famous vineyards, Le Bon Climat and Bien Nacido. The wine is refined and sophisticated, loaded with soft velvety tannin that seamlessly flows through across the palate. Bright cherries, dark chocolate, and a touch of vanilla are all found but, the clarity and texture really shine.
",Pinot Noir
"The 2013 “Knox” bottling from Au Bon Climat is ethereal, energetic and flat out wonderful. It is rare that I compare Domestic Pinot Noir to Burgundy, so often are those comparisons thrown out into the conversation and so infrequently do they hold any merit, but yet this wine compels me to do so as I believe it appeals to the Burgundy crowd equally as much as the Domestic drinkers. The main reason: the wine’s feel. From nose to finish this wine is reminiscent of those great Burgundies that transcend place and just become great wines. Heavily perfumed, but subtle at the same time the wine’s nose is packed with rhubarb, pomegranate husk, gunflint, crushed pebbles and a youthful barrel toast. Sunny and fresh on the palate this has an undercurrent of iron rich bloodiness and earthy savor keeping the serious mélange of cherry flesh, shaved fennel, whole raspberries, amaro spice and floral material from becoming too ripe, or edgy. This is just a superb food wine now with the power to go with something rich like porchetta or be the lithe background note to a simple fresh salad. The best thing about this bottle may be watching its evolution, my guess is this wine is going to pick up body and heft as it ages and will be a treat to drink over the next 12-18 years.
",Pinot Noir
"The vintner of Au Bon Climat, Jim Clendenen, takes the creation of his small-batch Pinot Noir very seriously. Having lived and worked in Burgundy for many years, he took that knowledge with him to the Santa Maria Valley, and began creating exceptionally high-quality Pinot with minimal interference in Mother Nature's processes, placing an emphasis on place and varietal. The Knox Alexander is particularly special as it is not only the top barrel select Pinot Noir of Au Bon Climat, coming from the Estate vineyards, but it's named after Clendenen's own son, Knox Alexander. The wine is light bodied and paler in hue than many California Pinot Noirs, but the palate is extraordinarily condensed in flavor, and the varietal's natural spice components shine through. Knox Alexander has an elegant acidity, with unique aromas and flavors of five spice, cardamom and black and white pepper.
",Pinot Noir
"There's a reason why ABC Pinot Noir is frequently peppered into blind Burgundy tastings: because it's about as Burgundian (a term I often wince at...) as non-Burgundy gets.  Racy and linear, these are some of the highest quality domestic Pinot Noirs (and Chardonnays) on the market today, period.  Racy red fruit, dusty earth, wild herbs and a spicy undertone to round it out.  Drink it now or put it down for 10+ years.  Up to you.

"Elk Cove's Willamette Valley bottling of Pinot Noir is entirely estate fruit, and shows dark, intense flavors from the mature vines on their property. With smooth, silky tannins and polished fruit, this vintage has plenty to love, and offers both immediate appeal and good depth of flavors. Plum and cola notes dominate throughout the palate, and the length is excellent.
",Pinot Noir
"This is a great sparkling wine, showcasing the quality New Zealand is contributing to the sparkling scene. With Champagne-like chalky texture and good acidity, this wine demonstrates riper fruit, though a low dosage, with full, intense flavors. I am very impressed and look forward to sampling more New Zealand sparklers!

"The first thing to note about this crowd pleasing Brut is its beautiful biscuity aroma and focused acidity. Bright fruit pairs beautifully with the acid to offer tremendous clarity and refreshment. Fully certified as bio-dynamic in 2011, Quartz Reef is sure to be a hit at your next gathering.

"When winemaker Rudi Bauer was looking at the site for his own winery in the Bendigo sub-region after working at Rippon in Central Otago they had to consider the question, ""what if the Pinot Noir might not ripen?"" So, the thought of Sparkling wine was born. Clotilde Chauvet with family ties to Champagne followed Rudi as winemaker at Rippon and was one of the original shaeholders in Quartz Reef. Workshops with Jacques Peters from Veuve Cliquot followed with visits to Champagne helped Quartz Reef to become a specialist in Sparkling wine from New Zealand. Made from a blend of 58% Pinot Noir and 42% Chardonnay the wine is still hand riddled and disgorged and aged for a minimun of two years on the lees. Pear, apple, lime and brioche abound in the aromatics with a fine bead and texture that add up to a wine of real finesse and tremendous length.

"A very very good choice for bubbles this holiday season! Quartz Reef are (in my humble opinion) hands down the best sparkling producer in New Zealand. This stunning Brut is made from 58% Pinot Noir and 42% Chardonnay from Central Otago. The fruit is all grown Organically / Biodynamically and carefully hand picked. The wine spends a minimum of two years on the lees, after which every bottle is expertly hand riddled and disgorged. This wine is bright, fresh and pure. It shows crunchy, fresh orchard fruit with some citrus notes and a wonderfully floral, subtly toasty nose. On the palate the pedigree of the fruit is complemented by a wonderful rich and creamy texture. Excellent persistence and balance on the finish with mineral tones from the weathered granite and quartz rich soils from which the estate gets its name. Truly world class wine that performs far above its price point.

"I had the pleasure of tasting this elegant sparkling wine with the winemaker from New Zealand, who stopped by our store recently. Having just stepped off the plane not 24 hours prior, he was still enthusiastic about presenting us this wine! Pinot Noir dominates the blend with Chardonnay, with a sweet apple and pear, a lovely leesy toastiness, hints of mineral and zippy acid in the finish. This wine is biodynamic, hand picked, and done in the traditional method- and it is HAND riddled to boot! Not many sparkling wines left in the world today can claim that! The care taken with this wine is clear- and the price makes it a steal!

"Carefully blended from 76% Pinot Noir and 24% Chardonnay from the estate vineyard in Bendigo, this sparking wine first captivates the eye with its pale yellow highlights, and then flamboyantly seduces the palate with tightly-polished bubbles entranced by lively citrus fruits, crisp brioche and luscious cream. An alluring, wonderfully-harmonious champenoise sparkler for an amazing price!

"Wow!  Here we have a classy, traditional method sparkling from cool-climate Central Otago that can give some competitors in Champagne a run for the money. With a complx nose of minerals and creamy lees, lemon and leesey flavors and creamy texture on the palate, and clean, refreshing acid on the finish, there is a lot to love in this bubbly.  For the price, it is simply outstanding. If you are looking for an elegant sparkler to serve at a wedding reception or other large party, I highly recommend giving this a try.

"I thought the 2013 Pinot was a wonderful, near-term great drinker, but this 2014 absolutely steals the show. Rich in appearance and color, this highly refined, well-structured Pinot shows incredible aromas of strawberry, dried-rose-like petals in a  Burgundian sense to forest floor qualities on the nose, that carry over exceptionally well to a long, complex, rich, viscous, deeply flavored palate impression. A broad mid-range, this is an outstanding Pinot Gem at a ridiculously low price that is obviously meant for near-term consumption, although I thoroughly believe that it will age nicely and improve well beyond that [five to ten years+++]. Rusty wants at least two cases of this Gem in our wine room. GREAT VALUE; DON’T MISS THIS WONDERFUL PINOT! ***** 14.2% ABV *****

"A delicious California Pinot that is not overly sweet and provides a great balance of raspberry and strawberry notes with hints of white pepper. This light to medium-bodied wine has the fruity notes of Pinots from this region but is packed with a punch on the finish. At this price point, this could be your go-to everyday drinking wine or to bring to your next party! Don't miss out on this great value.

"Gainey's Pinot is a great representation of the Sta. Rita Hills AVA with its cherry cola, warm spice, tea leaf and tart cranberry notes. This is 100% Gainey estate fruit, harvested just 10 miles away from the Pacific Ocean so you get that cool, marine influence in the wine. It is medium in body and a great wine for people who want a Pinot that's not too heavy or light and will please a wide range of palates. Enjoy this wine now alongside roasted duck, chicken or grilled salmon.
",Pinot Noir
"The Gainey pinot noir is immaculately soft on the palate even though it's a wine with enough acidity and tannic structure to age for a few years in the cellar. It's lush and dark fruited up front, but soon that gives way into a earthier note that finishes with a bit of violet and dried herbs. The estate at Gainey has been in the family since 1962 when current winemaker Dan Gainey's grandfather first purchased 1800 acres in the Santa Ynez Valley for farming. They've been making wine on the property since 1984, but expanded their reach into new parcels under Dan's stewardship, all while continuing the family tradition of serious Central Coast pinot noir. The 2014 Santa Rita Hills is just another great example of that heritage of quality winemaking.

"Au Bon Climat produces some of California's finest and varietally pure Pinot Noir, and the 2016 Santa Barbara is an excellent example of their prowess. With aromas of ripe raspberry, tart bing cherry, plum and white pepper, the palate is light, but explodes with minerality. There is a characteristically condensed flavor in all Au Bon Climat Pinot, but the 2016 Santa Barbara is particularly focused and earthy, with a beautifully balanced and integrated acidity. Elegant and complex, this wine has a lovely spice component which becomes ever present while sipping.

"Rather than repeat the superlatives about this wine that the critics have already put in ink I'll simply tell you that I secured every single case of this wine I could put my hands on. I tasted it about 12 months ago and have been tracking its progress from NZ ever since. It's a stunning wine on every level and confirms that: (A) Marlborough can make world-class Pinot Noir. And: (B) Dog Point are one of the benchmark producers in the entire southern hemisphere. This is meticulously crafted Pinot Noir from some of most perfectly situated vineyards in the country, farmed under certified organic methods. It combines the vibrancy and succulence of fruit that is New Zealand's trademark and intertwines it with some of the exotic, alluring, savory, earthy qualities that makes Pinot Noir so evocative and enthralling...guess I couldn't avoid the superlatives entirely!
",Pinot Noir
"The incredible scores this Pinot Noir has received are well deserved in a wine such as this. This Pinot is incredibly soft and supple and is sure to be a favorite of any Pinot lover. It is velvety in mouthfeel with deep fruit and a slight woodsy character. It has a well-balanced nature and a long lasting mouthfeel. I truly feel this wine would please most palates with its approachable yet sophisticated style.
",Pinot Noir
"I would have guessed Cote de Beaune had I tasted this blind: lots of baking spice, hints of dried herbs and black tea, with dusty tannins and dark black cherry on the finish. The more and more we get access to great pinot noir from New Zealand, the more I think the aromatics and flavors continue to blur the border between Marlborough and Burgundy. In the case of this Dog Point, it's everything I generally head to France for, just more lifted, vibrant, and ready to drink in its youth. All the complexity with none of the wait - but it will still evolve nicely!

"I love the fact that Joseph Swan, after all these years, still produces such textbook ""Swan style"" pinot noir. I have had vintages going back to the mid-80's and these newer releases or no less interesting or unique. The Trenton is darker and deeper than is usual for Swan and this offering has a deep, red fruit nose with cinnamon and spicebox. On the palate black cherry, cola and more cinnamon. Great fruit and balance! Love it.

"This is an oeuil de perdrix, light coppery pink colored rose. Flavors are precise, with red currant, fennel and subtle herbs, an underlying calcareous minerality and a wonderfully elegant bead. Super classy stuff for under $25. Maybe about seven years ago, I tasted a few of the bubblies from Loxarel at a Spanish wine trade show. Ever since then I have been hooked. I have consumed so many bottles across their dizzying array of products, and built up so much product conviction along the way, that I would put these up against any sparkling wines in the store.

"This Sonoma County Pinot Noir is medium-bodied and bursts with pure varietal flavors and aromas of rose petal, black cherry and raspberry, delicately balanced with sweet vanilla notes and soft tannins and rocks !!!
",Pinot Noir
"This probably the best value Pinot Noir that we have, hands down. This is a bright, spicy effort that lends itself very, very well to nearly any meal. Bright red strawberry and raspberry fruit with a hint of minerality and a very nice finish that lingers for a bit. A great pairing for fish, chicken, pork or barbecue.
",Pinot Noir
"This wine is juicy with nice fruity red fruit flavors and aromas. I think that this a great party wine because it is soft and round in the mouth and very easy to drink and enjoy. It will go well with pork or chicken.
",Pinot Noir
"The Olema Pinot Noir is made using fruit from Sonoma County— the Russian River and Sonoma Coast.  It’s medium bodied, has clean flavors of ripe black cherry and strawberry with a hint of cola, and subtle baking spices from 35% new French oak.  A great wine to have a couple cases of  on standby for company!
",Pinot Noir
"The 2014 Olema Pinot Noir is a party in a bottle. This is an endlessly drinkable Pinot Noir made in an approachable style. Ripe red fruits, including cherry and strawberry, dance across the palate. There is a slight hint of cola and baking spices, followed by a long, sweetly tannic finish. This bottle makes friends easily and is a steal in the under $20 pinot noir category.

"The ensuing wine review will be totally objective and non-prejudicial. After spending two-plus years {ending in 2002} clearing a just over four acre parcel of South facing hillside at my place in the Anderson Valley, I had trucked in a hundred and fifty tons of crushed limestone and fifty tons of compost, to which Christine [my better half} and I had ripped into the site with a three way, three foot deep dredge. We then seeded the hillside with clover for ground cover and let it sit for a year. At that point, we planted it to three different clones of Pinot Noir; half to Pommard, and a quarter each to 115 and 667. In 2006 {its first harvest}, we sold the property including the vineyard to Zac Robinson of Husch Vineyards. Husch has subsequently kept the productions coming off of this site separate from everything else that they were vinifying. This 2014 is perhaps the best that has come from this site to date and what has been produced thus far has been wonderful. This 2014 Gem is medium-deep ruby in color, has an opulent, floral nose of violets and dried rose petals, with undertones of strawberries and black cherries fruit combined with clove-like to a rustic Burgundian forest floor notes. On the palate, it is lush, balanced, well-integrated, really fine and elegant, and uniquely complex, all of which leads to a long, silky finish. Rusty already has had me bring home two cases of this Gem, and we toying with the idea of maybe another case. Even though it is delicious right now with airing, we plan to age it for another ten-plus years. A GREAT WINE VALUE!!! ***** 13.9% ABV *****
",Pinot Noir
"This exciting Pinot release from Husch comes from Nash Mill Vineyard which was planted by K&L's very own Jim Barr! This wine is bright, fresh and elegant showing aromas of candied cherries, rose petal and some savory notes as well. The finish is long, dry and complimented with fine tannin. This wine is a must try!
",Pinot Noir
"The 2014 Husch ""Nash Mill Vineyard"" Pinot Noir from Anderson Valley is extremely small production, (only two barrels made) high quality, and an excellent value. The palate is very dry and earthy, with a concentrated tannin, and a uniquely rustic quality. Aromas and flavors of forest floor, clove, all spice and plum are embraced by a balanced acidity, and this wine has fantastic aging potential. We are fortunate enough to have an exclusive on this wine, and for those who are interested in viticulture, it also happens to be sourced from grapes planted by long time Redwood city K and L employee Jim Barr.

"The 2014 Joseph Phelps Freestone Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir was showing great during our recent buying trip to Napa Valley, when the K&L team had the privilege to talk with Will Phelps, grandson of Napa Valley icon Joseph Phelps and current executive manager of the Joseph Phelps estate. Phelps explained how they picked from two different plots with different levels of sun exposure to create a complete and complex Pinot profile. Fresh, crunchy, ripe red fruit like raspberries, strawberries and plums with savory elements of spicy earth, forest floor and a touch of salinity make for a beautiful, well-crafted and powerful Sonoma Coast Pinot.
",Pinot Noir
"One of the most fascinating Pinot Noirs of the year for me. It took Sam and I several years to finally get these wines here! But it was seriously worth the wait. Stargazer is a tiny passion project of winemaker Samantha Connew. With a storied history of making wine across Australia, Oregon, Italy, Spain - Sam brings a wealth of knowledge to the table and her vinous prowess is known to all that have met her. She is also the Chair of Judges at the Royal Sydney Wine Show...on of the most prestigious wine awards in the country. This minuscule production Pinot Noir of just 240 cases is wonderfully aromatic and pure. It's light, transparent color in the glass belies it's concentration of flavor but hints at the wines ethereal elegance on the palate. The nose is filled with rose petals, crunchy red berries, saffron, dusty, dry spice and singed agar wood. The palate is light, fresh, taught and full of drive and precision...but it's not super lean or tart, the mid-palate has a nice softness but with minimal extraction. On the finish again acidity and cool fruit take precedence over tannin but there is nothing aggressive about the acidity, the wine is so fresh and vibrant but soft and silky at the same time. Beautifully crafted Pinot Noir.
",Pinot Noir
"With all the hard work done by New Zealand buyer Ryan Woodhouse, we are spoiled for choice in selecting delicious, well priced NZ Pinot Noir. That being said, anyone looking for exceptional quality and unbeatable pricing ought to be drinking the 2011 La Strada Pinot Noir from Fromm. There is so much on offer here. Ripe red and black fruits. Subtle spice. Real depth and complexity. A reserved, Burgundian style even for an entry level bottling. Do yourself a favor and get this into a decanter for an hour before dinner, then enjoy with grilled salmon or roast chicken. You'll be surprised just how much $20 buys you.
",Pinot Noir
"Another fabulous value for Kiwi Pinot. This is deep powerful Pinot that will scratch the itch for most Cali Pinot drinkers, but not scare away those in love with more expressive terroir-driven style. Earthy, savory dark cherry, great structure with red and black fruit continuing on the palate. Pure and structured, this will easily improve over the next 2-3 years, but shows beautifully right now. For only $20, cases, dude, cases.
",Pinot Noir
"This wine gets better every time I taste it. Beautifully elegant, red rose & red cherry, sandalwood, cassis, currant, mineral and hints of earthiness. Lively acidity and soft, easy tannin. A total no-brainer to stock up on as we start a warm spring!
",Pinot Noir
"Fromm has been crushing it with their Pinot Noir the last couple vintages! Fresh red fruit and rose petal aromatics, vibrant and spicy mid palate, pure fruit without being rich or cloying, and fine tannins on the finish. Every sip continued to impress with overall vibrancy and balance. Outstanding stuff!
",Pinot Noir
"This bright and compelling Pinot from NZ is pretty hard to beat. Truly fantastic Pinots are nearly impossible to find under $20, but this one delivers.  It's not a New World ""thick"" Pinot, rather it shows its varietal characteristics confidently and soundly while offering complex notes of spices, florals and earthy notes floating over a lovely array of red and blue fruits, and with fine tannins and a great acid balance.  Bravo!
",Pinot Noir
"This is a Pinot lovers Pinot...That might sound strange...but in this world of big, black, 15.5% ALC Pinot Noir...this Fromm bottling is a breath of fresh dirt! Much more concerned with dusty red fruits, forest floor, earth and savory tones than high octane, heavily extracted fruit and new oak. The nose sets the scene for the wines precision and focus. Tightly packed red berries, dry leaves and Chanterelles. The wine gains weight with some time in the glass taking time to unfold like all great Pinot should. Dusty dark red berries emerge, leaf litter, bark and river stone. A very Burgundian profile with some tell tale spiced orange peel and clove notes that give away it's Marlborough origins to the experienced observer. I truly believe this wine still has more to give and think it will flesh out further with a few more months / years in the cellar. However even now this wine is bright, fresh, pure Pinot Noir that is a really pleasing style for those looking for a more traditional, elegant expression of this fickle grape. Absolutely exceptional value thanks to our direct import.
",Pinot Noir
"The 2010 “La Strada” Pinot Noir which scored 94-95 points from James Suckling, was a runaway success earlier this year with nearly 3,000 bottles sold. The 2011 though not yet rated, is a more than worthy follow up from this certified organic winery that is one of the top producers in Marlborough if not all New Zealand. The wine has a bouquet that is bright and lifted with raspberry, cherry, white pepper, clove, dried tangerine peel, and a subtle use of integrated oak. On the palate, ripe plum notes are added to the great purity of fruit which is supported by good acidity and a fine grained tannin structure that leads to a long persistent finish. While very drinkable now, you can put some away and be quite happy that you did for a modest price.
",Pinot Noir
"I don't have a lot of experience drinking Pinot Noir from Argentina, but my goodness this wine really sets the bar high.  I was delighted as I sorted through the endless layers of fruit and spice.  It had ample acidity, fine balanced tannin, a beautiful bouquet of ripe alpine strawberries, slightly dried rose petals and hints of fresh violet.  This wine is ready to drink now!  I enjoyed it with a couple friends and a soft pungent cheese.
",Pinot Noir
"Light to medium bodied, this Patagonian Pinot Noir is an exceedingly graceful package. Fresh, crunchy red berries with subtle blueberry, purple flowers, black pepper, and vein of savory salinity. This continues to open in the glass, revealing subtle baking spices and deeper, earthy complexities. From top to bottom this is incredibly earnest Pinot, striking that rare balance between simply pretty and deceptively complex.
",Pinot Noir
"This is Pinot Noir! Light Pinot Noir, 12.6 ABV. This perfectly captures that paradoxical element that, for me great Pinot's have, a delicate light tactile impression with bold intense flavors that linger and linger.  Dusty Morello cherries, woodsy(not oaky) eathy spice, whispers of savory spice and all of that on a clean precise with with mouth watering acidity and finish that goes on and on.  Oh, and it is made without sulpher if that is important to you....
",Pinot Noir
"As I tried this wine Joe told me that the name meant that it was without sulfites. That is cool but I was worried that if that was the big selling point for them the wine may not really speak for itself. Thankfully I was completely wrong, instead I was delighted to try a Pinot that hits a beautiful spot for me. On a lighter an more delicate side of Pinot, which is where I love this grape to be, this wine was not at all weak or watery. Rather it shows red berry, floral, a little spice note opting for balance over brawn. This is precisely the kind of wine that I love, long, elegant, and perfectly in my particular price range.
",Pinot Noir
"This is, hands down, not only one of the most beautiful, delicate, and effortlessly delicious Pinot Noirs I have tasted in a while, it is simply one of the best deals in PN I think we'll see all year. Produced in tiny quantities in Argentinian Patagonia, this bottling is basically a selection from the winery's (also very good) $50 bottling. For some inexplicable reason, this smaller and more particular production is $15 less than the other bottling. For under $35, you get a Pinot Noir with so much finesse: pretty red fruits, delicate rose petal qualities, low ABV, and a quiet complexity that does not detract from how delicious and immediately approachable it is. Once again I think this is amongst our best Pinot Noir offerings year to date; it's super limited and bound to not last long so I would  act fast on this one.
",Pinot Noir
"This absolutely 100% tasty Brut Rose is 100% pinot noir. It is dosed at a low 7 grams per liter dosage with 2-3 years on the lees. It has ripe strawberry fruit with hints of tart cranberries and red fruits. Lush, yet dry and extremely delicious!
",Pinot Noir
"This all Pinot Noir Champagne is made with a three day long maceration, rather than more common method of adding red wine for color and flavor. It is vinified in only stainless steel vats and moved by gravity to avoid oxygen and preserve freshness, and dosed at a fairly low 7g/l. This Champagne has a wild nose with plenty of black cherry Pinot authority and savor. In the mouth it is spicy, extroverted and fresh.

"This was one of the best wines I tasted on our trip to Burgundy this past Spring and it was my first foray into the Parent sisters' portfolio, one that I've come to swear by since. Anne and Catherine have pooled their inheritance together and forged ahead under the family's domaine name, making wines with real character and grace. The 2015 ""Les Argillieres"" showcases the dark and fleshy fruit of Pommard, but with restraint and balance. It's never too tannic, earthy, or intense, peaking in the just the right places and exhilarating the taste buds with fresh acidity in addition to all that ripe 2015 fruit. This is a wine built for the distance, however, so no matter how good it tastes now, just know that it's going to taste even better down the line.
",Pinot Noir
"This opens with a very pretty and floral nose of violet and dark berry cherry.  There is good richness to the dark and sweet middle and the finish is substantial and long.  This is easy to drink and delicious.
",Pinot Noir
"2015 Domaine Jean-Michel Giboulot Hautes-Côtes de Beaune has more dark fruit in it: black cassis and dark Hudson cherry fruit dominates the aromas and flavors. There are also notes of black tea on the palate, mouthfeel is dense and juicy. Everything seems to be in great balance: tannins, acidity and just a hint of oak come together seamlessly.
",Pinot Noir
"This wine has a haunting nose of cassis and violets, with a brooding core of dark berry fruit with richness that comes purely from the ripeness of the 2015 vintage. Just a hint of oak rounds out the finish. YUM!
",Pinot Noir
"A delightful bottle for those looking for a little more richness in their Burgundy while still being a wine from this area. The Hautes-Cotes de Beaune features a clean nose with perfectly ripe raspberry and hints of cherry. There is a lovely amount of fruit in the wine and very soft tannins that coat the palate on the finish. The acid here really is to balance the wine, not to drive it. A soft, easy to like Pinot for those dipping their toes into Burgundy.
",Pinot Noir
"What gets me about this wine is the terrific balance it shows between the ripe, fruit driven 2015 vintage and a “hands off”, classic winemaking approach. Of course this “hands off” approach works best when Mother Nature works in your favor, as it did in 2015.  This wine does see 1/3 new oak, which helps to add that lush, round mouth feel that is followed by a lovely freshness.
",Pinot Noir
"Of the wines from this producer that we currently have in stock., this immediately shows the most high-toned fruit and savory qualities on the palate. With the potential of 2-3 years on the cellar it offers plenty of enjoyment now. Try with a mustard and tarragon crusted pork roast and haricots verts.
",Pinot Noir
"The “Peter Max” Pinot Noir is fermented over an unusually long four weeks using minimum extraction methods.  The result is a wine with power, concentration and elegance.  It’s full of savory fruit flavors like cherry, raspberry and strawberry with strong herbs and tea leaves.  It’s sexy and luscious while retaining great acid structure from the cooler climate of Walker Bay.  A wonderful wine for the money.
",Pinot Noir
"This is a lovely Pinot of distinction from Burn Cottage in New Zealand. Ted Lemon, winemaker, is also the founder of Littorai wines in Sonoma County, renowned for their delicious Burgundy varietals. Ted brings that passion and expertise to the heart of this wine, which is fruit driven, light, lifted and clean on the palate, with oodles of exotic spices.
",Pinot Noir
"Such an impressive wine (especially at our EXTRA special pricing). This is brimming with mulling spices: clove, citrus peel, cinnamon, nutmeg. Lush dark fruits, sandalwood and some raspberry puree join the mix with a swirl or two and carry through on to the palate. In the mouth the wine is generous with ample fruit and texture. Fine tannins give nice shape to the medium plus body. This is a beautiful release from Burn Cottage / Ted Lemon (Littorai). This wine expertly captures the exotic and extrovert expression of Central Otago Pinot Noir but manages to keep it elegantly restrained in a wine with perfect natural balance and a very moderate 13.5% abv.

"Maybe the Kremstal region of Austria isn't at the front of your mind when shopping for a bottle of Pinot Noir...yet this wine might change that! A beautifully composed wine with a brooding earthy nose, deep dusty berry fruits, cocoa nib, dried herbs. The palate is lush with wild hints of loganberry, dark cherry and spice. The nose keeps evolving showing  forest floor, bramble, freshly forage mushrooms. It's like a flavor wheel for Pinot Noir showing of the varieties complexity and savory nuances. The whole this is wrapped up with some nice toasty oak tones to add a little polish to the wine. What a value!  What a compelling wine from a producer trying to put Austrian Pinot Noir on the map...and with this wine he very well might succeed.
",Pinot Noir
"Another deep, dense, brooding Calvert bottling. This wine never really show it's true predigre on release but it's already looking pretty good. Like many great wines of the world as the minutes, hours, days, years tick on by the wine evolves, shape-shifts and continues to amaze. Whilst not having the immediate appeal the Cornish Point always seems to have...if you're in this for the long haul it's often a case of the Tortoise and the Hare.

"Many California Pinot drinkers wouldn't bat an eye to spend $50 on a high quality Sonoma or Santa Rita Pinot Noir. Burgundy drinkers are just barely getting started at this price point, yet Felton Road is making absolutely world class wines and it feels like NO ONE IS NOTICING! Blind there would be no doubt to the trained aficionado that this is the fanciest Pinot. It's easy to recognize the world class wine making behind this special bottle. Powerful mineral complexity plays off a deep dark cherry and subtle savory quality. Incredibly pure and sound with a seamless structure that indicates years of further development ahead.
",Pinot Noir
"Very elegant with intense and pretty floral aromatics. Violets, along with cola, black cherries, along with wild berries and delicate spices. A wine that is never overwhelming, with a soft palate and incredibly velvety tannins. Excellent indeed
",Pinot Noir
"Incredible value in an adorable half bottle, Brochet’s Extra Brut is a crisper option, singing with lemon and bright white floral notes (the winemakers specify acacia). Nimble acid is balanced by a richer, elegant mouthfeel and a tiny bead typically only seen in Champagne twice this price. Citrusy up front, with a distinct red berry hit from the 75% Pinot Noir, this steely wine is surprisingly toasty through the palate, and feels rounder than its five grams/L dosage implies. A sure bet for seafood, the food-friendly Extra Brut has plenty of lift and razor focus, and makes even weeknight takeout feel luxurious.
",Pinot Noir
"One of our staff’s favorite Pinots every year, the 2013 Joseph Swan “Saralee’s Vineyard” is sublime. Incredibly floral with wild iris and wisteria tones, backed by warm spice and energetic and lip-smacking red fruits, this is one complex Pinot Noir. What really separates it from so many others we sampled is its almost complete weightlessness. This is somehow packed with flavor yet never bogs down in pitchy weight or unnecessary ripeness. My final note on this wine is not suitable for print—it included a lot of exclamatory excitement and maybe a few joyous curse words!
",Pinot Noir
"A classic Pinot Noir beauty. This wine is not big and  lusty with a  deep red color. It is lighter colored and delicate with seductive and expressive aromas that are absolutely lovely. In the mouth it is elegant with complex  red fruit flavors that are layered and dry. Try it alone or with lighter foods.
",Pinot Noir
"This is stylish, cooler climate Pinot Noir. The fruit flavors are fresh, with tension and a somewhat stern backbone likely contributed by the inclusion of some stems in this cuvee. Relatively few under $25 Pinot Noirs make much of an impression on me; this bottling of Giant Steps is one of the exceptions that proves the rule. Great stuff!
",Pinot Noir
"More showy than the Vosne-Romanée and more weighty than the Chambolle-Musigny, this wine has generous black fruit, subtle spice and enough tannin and acid to make this a solid choice for short-term cellaring.
",Pinot Noir
"Sharing a similar purity and vibrancy with Gelin's delicious Fixin village wine, the Clos Napoleon is more structured with fine chalky tannins and has more tension to the tart acidity and crunchy red fruits. Hard ground spices and bay leaf add complexity. Great intensity while remaining light footed. The is a minerality here that is quite profound. I can see why this site has been long admired in Burgundy. Gelin's current vines are 50 yrs of age and really convey a powerful sense of place.
",Pinot Noir
"This site was considered one of the top flight premier crus in Burgundy 150 years ago, and with Domaine Pierre Gelin's excellent work in the vineyard, it is rocketing back to prominence. While it might seem expensive for Fixin, it is a great deal for the wine inside. In another 5 years, we'll be talking about the good old days when the Napoleon was affordable--mark my words! This is broad shouldered, powerful, tannic Burgundy that is fit for an emperor, but best for the cellar. Although the 2012 vintage has given it the fat to make it approachable now with food and a long airing in the decanter, this fantastically long and complex 1er cru will be much better in a few years.
",Pinot Noir
"A blend of 50% Pinot Noir, 30% Chardonnay and 20% Pinot Meunier. A large (15%) blend of still Pinot Noir in the mix. The nose has cherries, red boysenberries and fresh cream. Soft and lush on the palate with orange marmalade undertones. A great choice for people who like a slightly richer, more opulent style of brut rosé.
",Pinot Noir
"Powerful Pommard, with strong aromas of black cherry and black raspberry. This wine has nice concentration, density and grip with spicy notes of cinnamon and clove, yet stays crisp and crunchy in the mouth. A solid release!
",Pinot Noir
"Most of you who know me well, are aware that I have not seriously collected Burgundy for my wine cellar since the 1999 vintage was released. And not because I am getting to the age where those wines might outlive me or that I am sitting on 200-plus cases in my cellar. I just wasn’t convinced that such vintages as 2005 and 2009 in Burgundy, in general, were as exceptional as the press presented to us. I did buy a few wines from each vintage, but not in the quantity that I did with the 1999s. That is about to change! The 2015 is one of those to-die-for vintages and even the declassified productions are  truly outstanding. This production from Giboulot is a great example of what I am asserting. I honestly believe that this is declassified Pommard, probably from the lower hillside of their vineyard sites, and it is a remarkable wine. Rich in appearance and color, the opulent nose is loaded with classic rose petal, plumy, blackberry fruit tones with a lovely creamy to forest floor background. This all carries over exceptionally well to a broad, rich, viscous, silky, round palate impression that leads to a long, warm finish. I am going to both age some of this Gem for five to ten years and drink it near-term, and Rusty has ordered me to bring home several cases of this gorgeous puppy. By the way, I also purchased for my cellar a half of a case of the 2015 Domaine Giboulot Pommard, “En Brescul” which is truly great wine, to which I plan to age for well over ten years.  BOTH ARE EXCEPTIONAL VALUES!!!     …..A K&L WINE MERCHANTS’ DIRECT IMPORT…..  ***** 12.5% ABV *****
",Pinot Noir
"This is the darkest and the most brooding of the 2015 red Giboulot portfolio. Blackberries galore on the palate with subtle spice and a rather full body for what I typically expect from Burgundy. You could pour this at a California pinot tasting and fool everyone into thinking it was from Sonoma. This is a richer and fatter Pommard that drinks beautifully already in its youth.
",Pinot Noir
"I had to do a double-take when I saw the price of this wine. I love Pommard, but rarely am I able to spend less than $80..but less then $40 and get a great bottle? Unheard of...Purple fruits, subtle spice with hints of graphite and gingerbread. Tons of length and complexity this wine slowly unfolds on the palate. Ready to drink now, this is an incredible bargain.
",Pinot Noir
"This is a very elegant Pinot Noir from a higher elevation site. Its location gives it lifted, bright acidity and a strong spicy quality. Sweet, soft fruit complements the acid and spice and they all feel perfectly in balance. This really is phenomenal Pinot Noir, more similar to Burgundy than California. Would be a fantastic dinner or gift bottle.
",Pinot Noir
"The aromatics of this Pinot will have you falling in love long before the wine even hits you lips. Such a beautiful perfume of alpine strawberries, rose petals, fresh raspberry, sweet baking spices, bramble leaf, agar wood. The nose is pronounced and fruit focused but there is so much more than just simple fruit. One the palate a similarly complex cacophony of flavors intermingle. The wine is elegant and medium bodied; a cool, crunchiness of fresh berries pervades every corner of the palate. This is a very pure, polished wine with super fine tannins, perfectly integrated acidity, expertly judged ripeness and extraction. It really is a beautiful wine shows the exotic, aromatic side of Pinot Noir but without even a suggestion of over ripeness or heaviness. Stunning value too.
",Pinot Noir
"Very pretty rose petal and bright cherry nose. Starts out spicy on the palate and fleshes out with ripe strawberry and dark, black cherry fruit. Background notes of baking spices and white pepper with a nice, finely acidic finish. Really, just a lovely, lovely Pinot Noir!

"This is bright and forward with vivid raspberry fruit and spice gushing through the rich middle.  The dark color and ripe flavors really showcase the warmth of the vintage.
",Pinot Noir
"I've a soft spot for good Marsannay, and so I certainly have an even greater weakness for great Marsannay. Domaine Huguenot Champs Perdrix is great Marsannay. Explosive on the nose, with loads of red and blue fruit aromas, and a floral, violet quality, the palate is juicy and vibrant, generous yet poised, ever so slightly showy but ultimately balanced. Delicious red Burgundy to drink now or cellar in the mid-term.
",Pinot Noir
"Well, folks, we've found it! A phenomenal value for 2015 Bourgogne Rouge, well under 20! This wine has all the lovely round fruit and palate weight that we are finding in many wines from this vintage, but it doesn't sacrifice structure. Don't be deceived by the price point here. This little wine could easily age gracefully for 5 to 10 years. That's the beauty of Burgundy in a great vintage like this. You can find phenomenal wine with structure and depth from a lesser known area that is built to age.

"A long-time fan of all things SCARLETT, from the letter itself and Ms. O'Hara, I found myself quite excited upon the discovery of this lovely Santa Maria Valley Pinot's name. This is an absolute dream for November, and all the turkey that comes with it. A plush, velvety texture accompanies the dark fruit, supple tannins, and long finish! This wine is so good that you should VOLUNTARILY wear the letter A in public. Of course, A stands for AMAZING!
",Pinot Noir
"Lately I have been super impressed with the wines from the Santa Maria appellation! The 2013 Challen “Scarlett” Santa Maria Pinot Noir is a great example of a Pinot at a reasonably price point from this appellation. It is a wonderfully fleshy, fruit-forward wine that still shows balance and elegance. Strawberry jam, red currants, cloves and hints of sweet tea are followed by a soft, silky finish. Very tasty!

"This Pinot is not to be missed. This is an age-worthy champ. It has a full, rich mouthfeel that still shows as refined and lifted. Dark cherry and blueberry flavors, leather, spice and a beautiful floral element.

"Zio Tony Ranch, originally an apple orchard, is home to Chardonnay, Syrah and Pinot Noir vines that thrive with the vineyard's warm/cool temperatures. This 2015 Pinot from Martinelli is a dense wine with vibrant fruit and good balance. Fruit flavors include red cherry, blueberries and plum with tobacco and baking spice notes as well. This is a wine that's well worth the price and could age for quite some time.
",Pinot Noir
"I love the contrast between the Bondi Home Ranch Pinot to the Zio Tony Ranch Pinot. While the Bondi is more savory and lifted, the Zio Tony is dense and brooding. Aromatic blue fruit and violets jump out of the glass accompanied by fresh molasses and blackberry notes. The real difference between the two single vineyards is in the weight; the Zio Tony is rich, concentrated and full bodied (for a pinot noir). I always try to steer away from the classic rib-eye steak and cali cab pairing and this pinot noir is the ideal replacement to pair with any steak dinner!
",Pinot Noir
"Blauburgunder (Pinot Noir) is a lovely wine. Sweet perfumed cherries, flowers and spices all come together in this harmonious wine. Cantina Valle Isarco's  Blauburgunder captures an attractive middle ground between the lighter and richer styles of Pinot being made in Alto Adige. If you enjoy European-influenced Pinot with acidity, vibrancy and balance, this will blow you away! Melt some strong cheese, dip some bread and veggies in there, and enjoy with a glass (or a bottle) of Tyrolean red!

"If you are even slightly skeptical about the quality of Germany Pinot Noir you should try this wine. It is a stunning example of just how magnificent they can be even at relatively inexpensive price points. This has a beautiful balance of seductive forest fruits, dried herbs, wild mushroom, leaf litter and mineral soil notes. The texture is dreamy with super fine tannins, a silky mid-palate and juicy acidity. Can be enjoyed now in it's youth or cellar for 10 years.
",Pinot Noir
"This is an affordable Old World-style Pinot Noir from the New World, and one that stresses Old World values like terroir. Fans of Bourgogne rouge with that cooler climate fruit and hint of minerality will be thrilled. The Zorzal drinks like something from a rustic French bistro, yet it was made in Argentina! It tastes real and honest without that overtly fruity, un-Pinot-like character that many sub-$20 Pinot Noirs carry. It's clearly Pinot, and it's real, un-manipulated, pure Pinot. I'm getting thirsty just thinking about it.
",Pinot Noir
"If your taste runs to lighter-bodied, old-world Pinot Noirs, this is a deal you don't want to miss. I recently tasted the new 2014 Zorzal Pinot Noir and was enthralled! The high elevation sites, along with the Michellini brothers' program of careful handling, early picking, and minimum oak usage, result in a very elegant expression of Pinot Noir. The light, herbal and crunchy red cherry notes predominate in this wine, with an excellent mushroom-y savory finish, and fine tuned structure. I would easily lay this bottle down for a few years, but it drinks beautifully now.
",Pinot Noir
"Zorzal continues to offer the goods for fans of  balanced, delicious wines showing great typicity and terroir. Take their most recent Pinot Noir, for example: a wine that shows fresh, lively fruit with a subtle underpinning of structure that comes from stem inclusion as well as picking grapes just at the point of ripeness.  For the price, I don't think we have any PN better than (or even close to as good as) this!

"Bright, juicy red fruits dominate this Pinot Noir from one of our favorite Yarra Valley producers. Lighter in structure and low in tannin, this Pinot is an easy to drink crowd-pleaser and you can feel good about opening it for any audience, both experienced wine connoisseurs and beginners. Not too rich or ripe and only lightly oaked, this wine is great with food and a wonderful choice for an affordable house red.

"A lovely, bright, fresh, mineral driven, dry rose of Pinot Noir from the limestone rich soils of the Rheinhessen. Made in a delicate refreshing style by up-and-coming superstar Florian Seehof. This is one of my favorite roses of the 2017 season, it has just the right amount of fruit, zest, texture and minerality - a super versatile wine and ultimately quaffable.
",Pinot Noir
"Single Barrel, cask strength Pinot Noir! Not sure if I've ever started a wine review like that before...but yes this is a single barrel wine that we (K&L) bought every available bottle of (234 bottles were left for us after Fromm's own wine making team took some for their own cellars)! Quarters vineyard is an organically farmed block up in the famed Brancott Valley. The soils consist of clay and fine silt giving a softness and generosity to the wines grown here. Bramble fruit, ripe raspberry, sweet wood spice. The palate is medium bodied with beautifully soft silky tannin. The fruit profile is quite exotic, with plenty of energy and flow. Warm earth notes mingle with macerated berries and sandalwood. Eminently drinkable right now with some air but an easy one to lay down for 5-10 should you desire. I'm so happy the folks at Fromm entrusted us with this tiny production, single vineyard wine - Cheers to them!

"My favorite of the lot for now, this one has a good concentration of red fruits, violets and a hint of fresh earth on the nose. This Vosne-Romanée is very satisfying on the palate, with silky smooth tannins and pleasantly vibrant acidity. There is a restrained presence of new oak towards the finish giving it a soft texture and a subtle lick of fruitiness.
",Pinot Noir
"2015 Domaine Jean-Michel Giboulot Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru ""Aux Gravains"" is bursting with aromas of strawberry and raspberry preserves. Silky and smooth it glides on your palate. Fresh cherry, earthy notes and pronounced minerality creates incredibly complex flavor profile. Wine keeps changing over the time in a decanter and opens up with more nuances: baking spice, floral notes and hints of cinnamon.
",Pinot Noir
"Ding, ding, ding! We have a winner! One whiff of this wine, one little sip as well, is all it will take for you to get back in your car, drive over to K&L, and buy a solid case of this wine. This is one of the most exciting mid-range red Burgundies to hit our store in years. The nose is a flurry of baking spices and ripe black cherry, while the palate carries those flavors further with a lushness and silkiness that you only get in riper years like 2015. Load up. Back up the truck. Do whatever you need to do to find a few extra bucks.
",Pinot Noir
"If you need proof as to why many Burgundy fanatics are looking at Savigny-les-Beaune as the new center of Burgundy values then all you need to do is try the 2015 Giboulot Savigny-les-Beaune 1er cru ""Aux Gravains"". Loaded with cherry, cinnamon and floral aromas the palate is packed with bright cherry, hibiscus and spice notes. Great length, fine tannins and zippy acidity round out this stellar offering.
",Pinot Noir
"Here's a totally beautiful expression with aromas of violet  and spice. The mid-palate is ripe with generous black cherry fruit showing a gravelly layer of minerality with fleshy body and chewy tannins.  There's nice volume, power and balance here proving that Premier Crus can still be affordable and make amazing food partners. Super recommended!
",Pinot Noir
"Of Giboulot’s single vineyard Savigny’s, ""Aux Gravains"" is probably my favorite. 1/3 of the grapes used for this wine are whole cluster pressed, which adds a bit of grip and complexity to the wine. The fruit is explosive in the mouth with a sweet, juicy middle core which is balanced with structure and acidity. Tannins on the finish are velvety and the finish is long.
",Pinot Noir
"If you are a fan of Russian River Pinot Noir, this little wine from Eric Kent is well worth your while. With fruit coming from both Russian River and Petaluma Gap, the wine is on the fuller-bodied side of Pinot, with rich, dark fruit and velvety tannins. Although I'm not typically a fan of bigger-style Pinot Noirs, this is a definite exception. The balance and finesse of the wine is truly outstanding. While it is drinking very well now, it does certainly have the bones to age for a few more years as well.
",Pinot Noir
"Intriguing notes of smoke, and the umami flavors, along with the cherry, and spice notes that embrace the palate, make this wine an intriguing Pinot, that is unfiltered. The finish shows an almost ""piquant"" note that I found delicious. This wine would be great with full flavor spicy foods like a chicken curry.
",Pinot Noir
"This formed part of a recent Clayvin vineyard three producer vertical we tasted with resident NZ expert and buyer Ryan Wood house. Giesen now owns Clayvin. Their bottling may have been the most delicious right now, with lovely cherry fruited purity and even some cherry pit/almond notes adding further complexity. This is so drinkable now but will undoubtedly improve in bottle for at least another 6-8 years.
",Pinot Noir
"Italian Pinot Noir is always certain to bring up discussions amongst Pinot Noir purists, although the grape has been grown in Italy for more than 150 years it has only been in the last 30-40 years that it has been taken seriously as a red variety and not just a sparkling wine grape. Pinot Noir is notorious for its persnickety need for very specific climate and soil requirements and across Italy small pieces have been planted across multiple regions. Pinot Noir is planted in Lombardy, Piedmont, Tuscany, Trentino and Alto Adige as well as the d’Amico’s vineyard is in Umbria. The d’Amico’s vineyard lies at 1800’ amongst the Calanchi along the Umbrian and Lazio border in a limestone rich soil, generally thought to be the best for Pinot Noir. I visited the winery in 2015 and met with the winemaker Guillaume Gelly, Guillaume is Alsatian and has a different take on how to make Pinot Noir, I felt really inspired by his approach. Guillaume is a vineyard first guy, and then vineyard second…he’s not interested in “making” anything he’s more of a shepherd, helping the grapes grow to their maximum representation of the particular growing year. This is still a young vineyard, only planted in 2003, and as it grows each year the depth of flavor increases and a gentler hand in the winery is necessary, the wine is aged for 10 months in a 3 year rotation of French barrique a third new, a third second passage and a third, third passage. 2013 was an excellent year, a slightly richer texture and depth than in previous years and as global warming advances their 1800’ elevation is ideal for Pinot Noir for its cooler evenings and better air flow. Try this wine with grilled lamb chops like I did!

"The Tatomer Edna Valley PN rose is gunning for my favorite domestic rose of the season. The bright, aromatic nose is filled with ripe strawberries and a hint of green fruit. It is light bodied with crunchy acidity, dry minerality and that delicious berry flavor. It is fresh, elongated and mouthwatering. Perfectly refreshing for a summer day!
",Pinot Noir
"Rose wines were in abundance during our March trip to the Central Coast earlier this year. Here's one of the ones that stood out for me! Super fresh, high-tone, strawberry are this wine's introductory nose. It draws you in with a tropical feel. On the palate you get wonderful dried fruits, and a nice mineral backbone. Everything holds together nicely with a nice kiss of acidity. Using the words of OutKast - ""So fresh and so clean"".
",Pinot Noir
"This direct-press Spätburgunder from an Edna Valley site specifically designated for  rosé was the first wine we tried on our recent Central Coast trek. Wow, what a way to kick-start the trip! Brilliant floral aromatics, high-toned strawberry and cherry notes, plus a touch of spice on the finish paired with great acidity and mouthwatering minerality made this a top contender for wine of the trip right out of the gates.
",Pinot Noir
"Of all the Rose I have tried this year, this one stands among the very best and with only 200 cases made, this is the very definition of esoteric. Bright floral and perfume components greet your nose. Fresh strawberries, a hint of mint and incredibly juicy acid make this an absolute must try, but hurry, we may not have it for long.
",Pinot Noir
"I remember the first time I tasted the wines from Tyler Winery. It was about six years ago and during the time when big, bombastic ""Parker"" wines were all the rage. But here was this fresh, young winery that was making high acid, structured, Old World style Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. Even I have to admit that initially I wasn't quite mentally prepared for such a racy style coming from a Santa Barbara county producer but I reveled in knowing that this wine would shut down the Francophiles who were always dogging Santa Barbara wines. The Tyler wines are focused, vivid and pure. For everyone that has ever doubted whether Southern California wines could rival Old World wines, the Tyler wines are a must!
",Pinot Noir
"Freshly harvested cranberries, first-of-the-season strawberries and forest floor characteristics make this value Pinot Noir from the Côte Chalonnaise a good fit for those who enjoy  the lighter, earthier side of Burgundy and not necessarily the fruit-driven style of 2015s from other villages.
",Pinot Noir
"Last year was our first time selling a rosé from TWR, one of our favorite NZ producers. I fell in love with it, and it quickly became my house rosé for the summer. This new 2016 TWR (Te Whare Ra) Pinot Noir Rosé Marlborough is a little more robust in style, a saignée bottling of Pinot Noir from a single block. Lightly savory with notes of spice. Bright red fruits, sweet and ripe, juicy and delicious. A worthy successor to last year's inaugural offering.
",Pinot Noir
"Don't let the bright color of this fuchsia beauty deter you from picking up this fantastic rosé!  This is 100% Pinot Noir rosé from Marlborough, made using saignée.  There is such a pretty nose of juicy cherry and strawberry.  It's crisp, dry and perfect for light summer fare.  Delicious!
",Pinot Noir
"Darker in color than the last vintage, but all kinds of character! This year's TWR Rose of Pinot Noir does not disappoint- red cherry, red plum, red currant, strawberry and spice with medium plus acidity and great balance. Looking for a rose to compliment your BBQ'ed ribs, salmon, chicken or steak- or perhaps a plate of cheese & charcuterie? Give this puppy a try! YUM!
",Pinot Noir
"This year's rosé is rather different from last year's, but just as delicious! While the 2015 rosé boasted lighter, classic Provencal style, the 2016 is much darker in hue, made in saignee style from the Rawiri vineyard. The wine shows lovely blackberry and raspberry notes, with some heft and weight. It's still quite dry, but with a peppery spice and richer fruit component that makes this an ideal food wine. Try this with lighter poultry dishes, veggie dishes, and salmon.
",Pinot Noir
"There is no more perfect way to usher in the warmer weather than with a fantastic Rosé from one of our favorite NZ producers, TWR. Darker in color than the 2015, this vintage showcases the standout qualities of the single vineyard this wine is sourced from in Marlborough. Rich, juicy fruit is king is this Pinot Noir Rosé, which has a touch of acidity and minerality to balance it thanks to New Zealand’s cool climate. An excellent choice for a spring or summer dinner, this wine can hold its flavor against many different dishes. This is definitely one of the top Rosé picks in the store!
",Pinot Noir
"A beautifully delineated bottle that exhibits all the ripe but focused qualities of Monterey Pinot, this one manages to show velvety black raspberry and blueberry, warm spices, chamomile, and buttery pie crust. The flavors here, while rich, are not over-the-top, nor are they uncharacteristic of Pinot. Fresh acidity and minerals cut the richness beautifully, finishing this wine with grace and elegance. Pair with a slightly nicer-than-average cedar-plank salmon or duck breast.
",Pinot Noir
"I'm rather impressed with this debut from Seabold Cellars and judging by the repeat purchases by our customers, they are too. This is quintessential dynamic California Pinot that has an abundance of Monterey fruit and spectacular vigor, elegance and structure. This has all the elements that make it an age-worthy wine: fruit, tannins, acidity and alcohol. So is this drinking nicely now? You’d better believe it! But this is small production wine, with less than 400 cases made so get one for tonight and one for your cellar before it's all gone.
",Pinot Noir
"The Rodger’s Creek Pinot Noir from Sojourn is the earthiest of the lineup. Classic forest floor, mint and spice linger behind a wall of upfront, ripe red fruits. A solid core of fruit carries this wine through on the finish.
",Pinot Noir
"A delicate, floral and fresh style of Pinot Noir, this is as strong a value and as convincing an argument for Pinot Noir in Argentina as I have yet to taste. Organically cultivated Pinot Noir is vinified with some stem inclusion, which shows in the lighter color and elegant grip of the tannins. Lovely Pinot Noir, and very fairly priced - thank you, Marcelo!
",Pinot Noir
"How many hand picked, hand riddled sparkling wines can you find for $12.99? Not many I think! We have all been lucky enough to enjoy the Mas Codina brut for the past few seasons and now we can enjoy the rose! Being from the hot, dry region of Penedes, the Pinot Noir grapes are picked in early August to keep the sugar levels down and the acidity up to create a dry, fresh rose. The wine is filled with the classic Pinot Noir notes of fresh berries and ripe cherry with a dry, chalky backbone that makes the wine non-stop!
",Pinot Noir
"Made from some of the best vineyards throughout the Willamette Valley: Croft, Hyland, Eola Springs, Bishop Creek, amongst others this Pinot is about as close to a “can’t miss” for not only Oregon Pinot Noir lovers but for any pinotfile out there. It probably doesn’t hurt that Louis-Michel Liger-Belair is the consulting winemaker here either. Blue fruited and with a pretty this has the aromas reminiscent of the forests of the Valley in the morning, wet/warm earth, evergreen and wild mushrooms with blackberry and fresh fennel. The complexity here is off the charts and is only rivaled by the equally interesting and irresistible palate. Slick and high toned, plush and sexy this wine has it all with flavors of fresh blueberry, loganberry, Chanterelles mushroom and a subtle but lasting oak spice. The best thing about this wine is that it is so drinkable, so approachable that it will be equally loved by your wine snob friends as it will be by your, well let’s just call them your less discerning friends.
",Pinot Noir
"A tremendously serious wine for thirty bucks, that's for sure.  The wine shows notes of fresh purple fruits, baking spices and a smokey, almost syrah-like characteristic that comes in on the mid-palate.  It's a wildly intriguing Pinot Noir that should age gracefully for another 5 to 8 years.
",Pinot Noir
"Maison L’Envoye, founded by Mark Tarlov, began in Burgundy and is now making wine in Tasmania and Williamette Valley as well. The Attache Pinot Noir is a barrel selection of the best lots and showcases true Williamette Valley terroir. Lifted and lush with blue and red fruits, the oak and spice add even more layers to this powerful Pinot.
",Pinot Noir
"This mid tier offering from Maison L'Envoye shows aromas of fresh cherry and raspberry, baking spices, and a slightly savory, smoked meat quality that was particularly intriguing. Again, fresh red fruits shined with perfectly integrated oak and a hint of tanin on the back end. This is a seductive Pinot Noir; very pretty fruits and a bright palate, yet layered and quite powerful!
",Pinot Noir
"This is truly an amazing Pinot. As you open this little treasure, pleasant aromas of wild strawberry, fresh leather and cedar fill the air. Medium to full-bodied. Richly textured berries and game mingle with a long, spicy, soft oak finish with fine tannins and a twist of vanilla on the finish. There is also some of that Alto Adige chalk and porphyry that give this lots of minerals and acidity for balance. This is a wine that will definitely stand up to something very rich on the plate; duck, or I will probably open mine and have with a leg of lamb.
",Pinot Noir
"This is kind of a guilty pleasure for me. The whole White Zinfandel phenomenon of lush, sweet, and poor quality rose that was, and is still, so widely available has scared most rose lovers away from anything with even a hint of sweetness. Shoppers still continue ask whether any of our Provence roses are sweet as a rough gauge for quality. But this off-dry rose from Germany is delicious. It's not overly sweet, just enough to round out the palate and work against the zippy acidity. There's even a little fizz this wine too. Tons of watermelon and cherry notes with great weight and texture. I'm totally a sucker for this wine.
",Pinot Noir
"What a phenomenal value! With this strong of a vintage, Esmonin's Mazy-Chambertin is likely one of the best Grand Crus we have in stock. The expressive and aromatic signature style of Esmonin combines with classic Mazy weight and gravity to form a full-bodied, soft, and open Burgundy with great complexity and length. I would highly recommend this wine for any Burgundy lovers looking for Grand Cru values.
",Pinot Noir
"This was the first time I've tasted this Pinot Noir and I was very impressed. Delicious cherries and fresh savory herbs are prominent on the nose. Tart acid, red beets, and sage fill the palate while supple clean wood is softly integrated. This is exceptional Pinot Noir coming out of Santa Cruz Mountains.
",Pinot Noir
"Very nice floral aromatics and sure... It is completely dry on the delicate palate. Reminiscent of a Sancerre rosé. The cool label sure makes it stand out in a crowded rosé line up these days.
",Pinot Noir
"What a surprising, delicious bottle of Pinot Noir Rose! The Reichsrat Von Buhl 2016 has lovely cherry fruit on the nose, contrasted by a dry and driven character on the palate. It has quite a bit of spicy complexity, balanced by plain refreshment. Add this into your lineup of rose... You won't regret it!
",Pinot Noir
"If you're serious about aging something from the incredible 2015 vintage in Burgundy, you can hardly go wrong with this wine. I tasted through a number of Grand Cru offerings from this vintage, and was highly impressed with Domaine Gros Frere Soeur's Echezeaux. The wine is fuller bodied, as you would expect from the vintage, with black fruit notes as well as the classic red fruit. The nose is already highly complex and perfumed, with spice, fruit, floral, and earth elements. On the palate, the wine is tightly structured with full fruit and a lengthy finish. All of the elements for aging are here in spades.
",Pinot Noir
"This is an original Patagonian white, made from 30% Sauvignon Blanc and 70% Pinot Noir grapes, both of which are co-fermented without extended skin maceration. A very minimal amount of SO2 was added prior to bottling - this fact combined with the retained CO2 during bottling creates a s lovely, refreshing white, with bone dry flavors and just a hint of Sauvignon's snappy green quality. 10% ABV, dry, a bit fizzy and every bit as refreshing as it sounds!  Yes!
",Pinot Noir
"Sojourn’s flagship, the Sangiacomo is sourced from two distinct blocks within the vineyard, one planted in an old creek bed and the other in deeper loam soils. Still feeling the influence of the Petaluma Gap, there is a deep core of fruit to this wine. Surrounded by rich cherry flavors, clove, cinnamon, earth and spice, it is a seriously complex wine that should improve for several years.
",Pinot Noir
"Of the four Valli Pinots I tasted i think I prefer the 2011 to any of the 2012's most likely due simply to the extra year of age.  All four of these fantastic Pinot Noir bottlings are simply delicious and will only improve with time although the Gibston vineyard seemed the most complete and ready to drink at this stage.  This is bright and floral with plenty of rich red fruit flavors and a wonderful acid tension that keeps this substantial wine fresh and balanced.  Just a lovely bottle.
",Pinot Noir
"Winemaker Grant Taylor is a legend in Gibbston Valley and this wine shows why. He has skilfully and subtly crafted this wine to show the nuances of this very tricky terroir. The nose shows lifted ripe red fruits, bramble fruit and dried herbs. On the palate the wine is medium-bodied with silky tannins and a lovely balance of savory spice and earthy meaty aromas to balance the brightness of the clean red fruits. The spicebox notes expand with air and the wine takes on some lovely sandalwood tones. Pure and polished, a lovely reflection on Gibbston Pinot Noir. 900 case total production. 13.0% ABV.
",Pinot Noir
"The Gap’s Crown Vineyard is on the west-facing slopes of Sonoma Mountain, where it also feels the influence of the high winds and cool fog of the Petaluma Gap. Its rocky soil and severe terrain naturally stress the vines, making Gap’s Crown one of the most desirable vineyards in the region. Darker fruit dominates the wine’s character, with black cherry, blueberry and spice. Grippier than the Rodgers Creek, giving a wonderful mouthfeel with Burgundian flair.
",Pinot Noir
"True blue, coastal Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir (nod nod, wink wink), Anthill Farm's SC bottling is really  good: wild plums, bright mixed berry, really fresh fruit and wonderful balance. One for the cellar or to enjoy now following a quick decant.
",Pinot Noir
"The 2011 Sojourn Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir is a fresh, delicate and lively Pinot Noir that will pair well with food. Not overdone and shows the softer side of Pinot.
",Pinot Noir
"I knew I was going to love this wine at first sniff.  Sappy, spicy, floral, wild strawberries, soft oak spice; all of which is very intense but delicate at the same time.  How can you not like that?  On the palate the wine has that same paradoxical nature bright delicate fruit, strawberries and rhubarb, that it lifted and jump right out at you. Then slowly the richness builds with dark fruit and oak spice appearing from the periphery. The wine mouth watering acidity gives it great length and the flavors seem to roll over and over again on and on.
",Pinot Noir
"It seems that each year Erich and Craig add a new Pinot fruit source. The 2008 Rodgers Creek is the first vintage they have produced of this wine, and it is a welcome addition. Rodgers Creek is located on a ridge in the Petaluma Gap, which is one of the coolest growing regions in Sonoma, and is ideally suited for producing classic Pinot Noir. The vines are grown in light chalky soils on steep inclines, causing natural vine stress and resulting in high levels of concentration. Even though this is a cool climate site, the wine has wonderful depth and expression. There is rich red fruit, a touch of minerality, a hint of toast and a wonderful silky feel.
",Pinot Noir
"I don't often get this excited about rose, but this is one of the best examples I have ever tried. Meyer-Nakel is one of the most reconcilable names from Germany and are famous for producing exceptional Spatburgunder, aka Pinot Noir. The wine is complex, and elegant, and exudes excellence. Bright and balanced acid seamlessly interact with soft minerality, a touch of spice and a beautiful bouquet of flowers. It's texture and richness drinks like a red wine, but the clarity shows it's lighter qualities. As a stand alone wine, this might be one of my top 10 wines that I have tried in 2017. Absolutely outstanding and worthy of cellar consideration.
",Pinot Noir
"This is rich and ripe with smoky black cherry fruit, a touch of oak and slate like minerality on the long finish.  The wine is very textural, warm and Burgundian in personality yet with clean and precise lines that are uniquely German.  Highly recommended for any Pinot lover.
",Pinot Noir
"Easily the best SLH Pinot Noir I've tasted this year - it's rich, expressive and dark-fruited.  Great entry weight on the palate and flavors of black fruits, dark berries and rose-hips come together gracefully to form one of the most complete wines I can remember tasting from the AVA, ever.  It's a mid to near-term drinker so pull the cork on this micro-production Pinot before the season ends and enjoy it until the last pitch.
",Pinot Noir
"This was a hit with our team when tasting - it balanced an earthiness with finely-tuned fruit that exemplified a well-built Pinot that's full of surprises.  Perhaps the most aromatically complex of the lineup, it still delivers depth on the palate with ripe strawberry, baking spice, black tea, and light oak.  Another winner from the team at Red Stitch, who is proving their mettle with Pinot Noir alongside their already renowned Cabernet.
",Pinot Noir
"This was my favorite of the lineup - a striking, bright, delineated Pinot that represents one of the up and coming, celebrated Central Coast sites in Soberanes Vineyard.  The balance and tension keeps this lively and it highlights what high-end California Pinot should be - aligned with a sense of place but with the ability to do so with refinement and class.  Drink now with a bit of air, or follow over the next decade.  Great stuff.
",Pinot Noir
"What a beautiful wine! The 2016 Esmonin Mazy Chambertin displays all the beauty and elegance the 2016 vintage is supposed to have. A gorgeous nose of red berries, red flowers and subtle spice notes gives way to a palate that is full of red berry fruit(cranberry, strawberry, pomegranate and raspberry). Fantastic balance, superb complexity and great persistence make this a great introduction to the wonderful 2016 Burgundy vintage.
",Pinot Noir
"Wine of astonishing beauty Mazy-Chambertin is incredibly aromatic. Notes of black cherry, blackcurrants and spice pour from the glass and captivate you immediately. On the palate it's powerful and opulent yet elegant and bright with uplifting acidity and voluptuous texture, full of black cherries and plum. Very dense and concentrated in flavor it will age for a long time though it's hard to keep your hands off it already!
",Pinot Noir
"This is part of a trio of new releases from Charles de Cazanove and it is a standout in our Champagne selection. Deep, dark, strawberry fruit with integrated tannin, black cherry and orange marmalade on the extremely long and lingering finish. This bubbly is super interesting and is quite unique to the lineup. This can definitely be one of those champagnes that will work with a main course of roasted pork loin or even a lean grilled steak. Enjoy!
",Pinot Noir
"While the 2016 Mazy is a bit more feminine the 2016 Esmonin Ruchottes Chambertin is definitely masculine in style. Notes of black fruits, spice and even a slight graphite note pepper the nose of this wine while on the palate there is ample weight and delineation. Baking spice and dark fruits meld with a coiled palate and firm tannins. A big wine that definitely needs time to completely unfurl.
",Pinot Noir
"Ruchottes-Chambertin is less concentrated and rich than Mazy but significantly more taut, racy and mineral thanks to rocky, limestone based soil in the vineyard. It's a charming wine with raspberry, black cherry, floral and sous-bois. Very bright, vivid and juicy on the palate with lots of earthy and mineral notes layering that cherry fruit profile.
",Pinot Noir
"Our newest Brut Nature is a classic, clean, citrus beauty with elements of cream and key lime. Refreshing and balanced with the acidity expected from a Brut Nature but, it is not overplayed. Clean, fresh, vibrant AND complex. A pleasure to have on our shelves!

"One of my favorite go to wines here at K&L! Great expressions of fresh, ripe fruit lend to a succulent, and juicy all around mouth-feel. I could open a bottle of this every day!

"I became an instant fan of this producer and especially the entry-level Rhone offering when I first tasted them, and they just seem to be getting better. The 2016 Cotes du Rhone showcases a greater elegance and brightness as opposed to the richer 2015 vintage. With the high level of Grenache, this wine is exactly the kind of Rhone that I love. Beautiful high tones of red fruit, notes of cherry, spice and cigar box with subtle tannin from the Syrah make this a wine easy to love with tons of different dishes.
",Rhone Blends
"Each year this organically farmed property continues to over-deliver on the QPR ratio.  The 2016 much like the 2015 has vibrant fresh fruit flavors of red cherry, spicebox and fennel seeds.  The '16 is a touch more charming than the 2015 having more lift and fresh acidity.  Based on the quality of even this basic Cotes du Rhone, you can expect even more deliciousness from their Villages level releases.
",Rhone Blends
"I continue to be surprised by the $15 and under Cotes-du-Rhones from 2015. Expecting rich, sweltering wines, I continue to find them exceptionally balanced with soaring aromatics and bright fruit. The Yves Cheron displays a bright, floral nose with blackberry notes and forward acidity that brightens the fruit on the palate. I was especially pleased that the wine had just a touch of tannic structure to frame everything and bring the wine together. At its price point, this is definitely my favorite Cotes-du-Rhones on the shelf.
",Rhone Blends
"This is a lot of wine for $12.99.  The nose is composed of blackberry coulis and black cherry with a spicy, white pepper and violet note thanks to the Syrah.  Dry and full of complexity, this wine has great length.  The cement aging leaves it bright and clean with wonderful acidity and great fruit on the palate.  A really beautiful wine for everyday drinking.
",Rhone Blends
"Delicious aromas of soft, bruised fruit with a violet edge, this wine has great concentration and a lot of flavor without being too heavy. I would consider this wine to have a touch more body than a lot of catch-all Cotes-du-Rhones, which makes it super fun and versatile.
",Rhone Blends
"A boisterous and delightful style to say the least, this Grenache-Syrah blend captures the essence of both the region and the quality of the 2015 vintage. Composed of fruit around Vacqueyras, Beaumes de Venise and Gigondas, the wine is named for the famous jagged limestone monoliths along the ridge of the Montmirail, the ""Dentelles.""  Packed with flavors of raspberry coulis and peppery spices, the wine is open and inviting, giving you sweet fruit and length.  It is a worthy wine of the region which harkens to some of the best that producers like St. Cosme and the Perrin family create.
",Rhone Blends
"The nose on this wine is full of deep, penetrating, dark fruit, and it’s not bashful. The fruit however is not sweetish, it smells refreshing, focused and layered. On the palate this wine has a distinct richness that is harnessed by some sweet tannins and refreshing acidity giving the wine a more faceted palate presence. A long and powerful finish, highlighted by the saturated fruit character, bits of spice and that dynamic structure. The wine is a mouthful and will be best served with richer meat or casserole dishes but is still delicious to drink now. A few years of age will do this wine a world of good.
",Rhone Blends
"If you've enjoyed the Baron Louis from Chateau Montfaucon (a K&L classic) over the years, then I'd take a serious look at this similarly-structured Lirac from Domaine La Loyane. Lirac is just across the river from Chateauneuf du Pape, so the wines have a similar make up and flavor profile—dark fruits, structure, weight. However, while the Parker review describes this wine as ""modern,"" there's nothing flashy or overtly fruity about this wine out of the bottle. It's more of an old school bistro wine when you first pop and pour, so make sure to give it time in a decanter and get some air into it. After a good twenty minutes the rusticity blows off and the berries become more pronounced on the nose. A half hour later, you're drinking the wine you were meant to drink: cherries, chocolate, and chewy tannins. It's a pretty serious wine for the sub-$20 price point. There are no training wheels here; there's a lot going on once you begin to unlock all those delicious layers.
",Rhone Blends
"So many of our customers are excited about buying the 2015's from the Rhone, and the La Loyane Lirac is a great example of why. This is dense, rich southern Rhone, but still has great earthiness and enough acidity to balance its tannin. If you are looking for a great Rhone to pair with grilled meats, or even cassoulet, this is a great choice. It will also reward medium term cellaring, so if you like it as much as I do, get a couple extras for years to come.
",Rhone Blends
"You may often read our poetic waxing about Chateau de Montfaucon, so sometimes I worry that we talk a little too much about their often overlooked region of Lirac.  But there is still so much to say, especially when you have an intriguing new discovery like Domaine La Loyane!  Lirac as a region sits across the river from famed Chateauneuf du Pape, that has similar soil structure and hillsides with all the same grape varieties grown in tandem.  It even has the historic significance of being one of the main export routes out of the region even before the Catholic church decided to move the papacy to Avignon.  The region was even recognized with Cru status just a few years after Chateauneuf.  But maybe we shouldn't say too much more as most of the prices in Lirac are depressed compared to what you would pay for a CDP of comparable quality.  Double the price on the La Loyane and you would easily mistake it for a top producer across the river.  Somewhere along the spectrum of Pegau or Le Vieux Donjon with beautiful blackcurrant fruit and notes of fig.  A light sauvage character of earth and spice fills the glass.  The Loyane is supple, not too sweet with just enough rusticity to remind you that you are definitely drinking French Rhone wines.  Now cut the price in half and here we are back in Lirac, getting the same quality juice and character for a fraction of what the old Pope would have paid.
",Rhone Blends
"The string of exceptional 2015's from the Southern Rhone continues with the Domaine La Loyane Lirac. The aromas are totally appealing--spice, black fruits, and a hint of savory character. On the palate the wine expresses good intensity, solid concentration, and hints of tobacco among rich fruit. Its flashy and polished, totally likable in everyway, but just enough of that old-world character to make it interesting.
",Rhone Blends
"A recent visit to Beaucastel for some barrel tasting definitely showed us why this is consistently one of the best producers in the region.  The 2015 has all of the beautiful rich undertones of classic CDP with the fresh lifted quality of the vintage.  Copious fruit, spicebox nuances and an impeccably balanced palate of sweet tannins and underlying acidity.  A wine that will drink well in its youth and evolve gracefully for 15-20 years.
",Rhone Blends
"Vinsobres is one of those Cru appellations that is still earning its bones much like Gigondas or Vacqueyras were 10 years ago.  Once a Cotes du Rhone Village it was elevated to Cru status because of its beautiful terroir and exposition.  Sitting towards the north end of the Southern Rhone, this is a much cooler climate compared to Chateauneuf du Pape and Gigondas.  Also, Syrah plays a much more important role in the blends here.  What you get are more aromatic and perfumed Rhones that have higher spice notes and more supple fruit. The Perrin family has such an amazing eye for detail as well and they would be the ideal candidate to suss out the best that this region has to offer.  They are of course the family behind Chateau de Beaucastel, probably the most iconic of all the Chateuneufs.  All fruit is farmed organically, all winemaking is top-notch and it all shows in the finished product.  The 2013 vintage was challenging to say the least.  Grenache was afflicted with collioure, where flowering doesn't occur properly and you are left with bunches of berries with lots of fruit missing.  This means lower yields overall but not bad fruit.  In fact quite good fruit.  Not as concentrated as in vintages like 2010 or 2012 but definitely classically styled flavors.  To finish the story, the supplier was a little long on the 2013 vintage, so of course they made us an offer and we made a counter-offer and we were able to land this normally $20+ wine for $13.  A Cru wine for a Village price!  So what about the wine?  Beautiful drinking for certain.  It is perfumed and harmonious with lovely currant and cherry notes.  Lots of potpourri and baking spices develop in the glass.  This has quickly arrived as one of my favorite go-to Rhones in the stores right now.  Ideal drinking now and for another 5 years or more.
",Rhone Blends
"If you have ever been in the LA Store and spoken with me, you would know I like anything under $15.00 that can claim to be amazing.  This Rhone Red fits the bill.  I am speaking of an ideal party-pleasing wine that anyone, no matter the palate, will enjoy. The nose is great with floral and spice.  The taste combines round mouthfeel and a surprising minerality, which leads to a plush, subtle finish.  Reach for this as a perfect pick for any holiday party or late night taco truck.
",Rhone Blends
"I adore the peppery notes in this juicy and easy-to-love 2013 Vinsobres. It's fleshy, but restrained and balanced against that classic Rhone profile of violets and spice. This is the best Rhone value I've tasted in this price range all year. It's everything you expect and everything you want for the price. In a world where Rhone values have become fruit bombs, over-the-top extracts in search of Parker points, the Perrin is a breath of fresh air.
",Rhone Blends
"Another fantastic deal from the Perrin family of Beaucastel fame.  This has dark, meaty flavors of plums, cherries and spice but with great freshness due to the vintage.  Hearty, but not heavy, this is a complex and food-friendly bottle that drinks well above its price.
",Rhone Blends
"Vinsobres is another tiny commune making up the vast area of the Rhone Valley. Located in the far, northeast corner of the Southern Rhone, you'll find the usual varieties like Grenache and Syrah, and like its neighbor Valreas, Vinsobres is known for wines of finesse and powerful aromatics. The Les Cornuds, made by Famille Perrin (Chateau Beaucastel), is a single vineyard blend with excellent concentration, crisp, up-front acid, and aromatics of dark fruits, brambles and spice. Clean and polished, but still true to its place, it reminds me of a handful of great everyday Rhones from this year like the Delas Cotes-du-Rhone and Petite Bellane. I'm a total sucker for everyday wines that outperform their price point and have a sense of place. This wine nails it on all accounts.
",Rhone Blends
"One my favorite Direct Imports knocks it out of the park once again.  The wines of Chateau de Montfaucon always drink well above their price point, and this is no exception.  Rich, plush and complex, notes of ripe red and black fruit mingle with warm baking spice and resinous dried herbs.  There's enough structure to make this a wonderful wine to pair with heartier fare, but it's also delicious enough to have a glass on its own while relaxing at home.
",Rhone Blends
"This is baby Châteauneuf-du-Pape, love 2013 for Cote du Rhone and LOVE Montflaucon! A great full body red with lots of layers & balance. TWO Thumbs up !
",Rhone Blends
"If you're a big fan of Rhone blends, be sure to add this one to your list. Grenache is by far my favorite Red Rhone grape varietal, and the 55% they use in this blend really shows it's true character on how incredible and complex Grenache can be. It's a perfect dinner wine, and also great to enjoy by itself.
",Rhone Blends
"This oak aged Chateauneuf-du-Pape wannabe comes from 50 to 90 year old vines and is loaded with cassis, jammy black currents, wild savory herbs, spice and earth in an effortless and long package.  The mid-palate is sweet and concentrated leading to a complex finish loaded with mineral and ripe tannin. This has been a staff go-to for as long as I can remember.
",Rhone Blends
"One of the very best values K&L offers, the Baron Louis Lirac is perennially one of the most well-structured, ageable Southern Rhone wines on the market.  It has deep, dark Grenache fruit flavors of black cherries and plum, with a hint of black pepper and eucalyptus.  Its tannins are hearty but fully integrated and very smooth, and a great finish fueled by crisp acid and lingering fruit flavors. 
",Rhone Blends
"Wow!  The 2013 is a real rocker from Montfaucon.  Through a tricky vintage where Grenache yields were incredibly low, winemaker Rudi Le Pin found the workaround, adding great spice and complexity to this wine this year with the addition of Syrah, Cinsault and company.  Full of deep rich briary red fruit, cinnamon and allspice notes and an ample finish, this is where I like my Rhone wines to sit.  Fresh, inviting and full of character.  Again, WOW!!
",Rhone Blends
"Maury is the deep dark flip side to Spain's Priorat.  The regions are part of what used to be (any may one day be again) Catalon.  They sit on opposite sides of the Pyranees (Priorat in Spain, Maury in France) with a shared cultural heritage which is where the joint characteristics begin.  Each region sits on the desirable black-brown slate/schist soils which make the terroir special, both revere the grapes Grenache and Syrah and both regions produce deeply concentrated wines of power and depth.  The big distinction though is many of the Priorat wines have reached price points higher than the elevations of their vineyards.  Not so much in Maury though.  Longer known more for dessert wine production, Maury is still establishing its footing with regards to pricing which has kept costs depressed.  That's to our benefit as consumers though because we get so many incredible dry wines for less than $30.  Now, throw Jean-Marc Lafage into the mix, who has established himself as one of the great value producers in the whole south of France and you have one of the most exceptional Catalonian buys this year.  The Saint Roch property really allows Mr. Lafage the freedom to let his vineyards fully express themselves.  The ""Kerbuccio"" is supple, rich and full of blackberry, currants and fig flavors.  The palate is sweet with fruit but has underlying slate notes and structure.  There is also an intriguing garrigue (coastal herbs surrounding the vineyards) note that really adds that next layer of depth which makes me think of one other great region - Priorat.  You would pay 2-3 times this much for a wine from the Spanish side at this quality (and with this kind of review).  This has as much to offer in terms of flavor, style and longevity but at a price that doesn't quite feel so hard on the pocket book.
",Rhone Blends
"Chateau Saint Roch have become a dependable, affordable go-to wines here at K&L. Never short on fruit, power, and concentration. However this is no simple fruit bomb. Coming from 50+ year old, organically farmed vines, this wine has good structure and minerality to underpin its bold black and blue fruit. Aged in mostly neutral large oak and concrete so there is very little barrel influence to be tasted here and it's not missed one bit. The wine has good purity and depth and is a faithful expression of what this lesser known corner of the wine world can produce at razor sharp prices.
",Rhone Blends
"In the Languedoc-Roussillon there is a sub-region called Maury Sec-Remember this name. This is the ""hot"" region where the best wines are currently hailing from. The quality of wines coming out of the Maury Sec for the cost is mind-blowing and a great example is the 2015 Chateau Saint Roch ""Kerbuccio"" Maury Sec. A blend of 80% Grenache and 20% Carignan this tastes like a fine Chateauneuf-du-Pape. Loaded with spice, mineral and gorgeous berry fruit notes this is a wine that punches way above its weight. I think I have just found my new house red wine!
",Rhone Blends
"We absolutely love the wines of Jean-Marc Lafage around here. You may know him from wines like the Bastide Miraflors, Narassa, and Albion--customer favorites that are always incredible values. The 2015 shows a darker side of Lafage. Tons of smoke, brambles and dark purple fruit on the nose, the wine showcases depth and power, but with remarkably sustained acidity. Just a hint of sweetness, melted tannins and a little bit of spice round out the palate, but overall the wine is lifted and beautiful.This another killer wine from southwest France anyone with a taste for power reds and exceptional value.
",Rhone Blends
"This wine is big and lusty with mouth-filling deep dark fruit flavors. But it is more than that. The Velours Noir offers layers of  flavors with the fruit balanced out with nice mineral notes and a sense of place. It will go well with hearty foods.
",Rhone Blends
"Derived from 100% Syrah, this wine is aged in barrel and has a beautiful, dense texture. This is reminiscent of the great wines of the Northern Rhône, and you would be hard-pressed not to think of producers like Chapoutier or Guigal while drinking it.
",Rhone Blends
"Looking out over the well-cultivated vineyards to the not too distant snow-capped Pyrenees, one can wonder that the Roussillon is regarded one of the warmest and sunniest regions in France. The efforts of Severine Bourrier and her husband Philippe are a consummation of  terroir, tenacity and talent, as they bring everything to the table in the creation of their remarkable wines. The Velours Noir gathers its fruit from black schist soils higher up in the estate, and possesses arresting aromas of blackberries, blackcurrants and dark cherries, with a rich,structured palate caressed by new oak, peppery spice and hints of wild mint. Sumptuous, ageworthy Syrah that could rival many from the Northern Rhone!
",Rhone Blends
"Look no further for you next grilled meat pairing! This 100% Languedoc Syrah shows beautiful dark fruits, mineral, black pepper and some subtle menthol character that is balanced with mid-palate tannic structure. Although this wine is aromatic and expressive now, don't hesitate to lay it down in the cellar.
",Rhone Blends
"I love Syrah when it is neither too gamey nor too thin. This one falls in the middle. The ""Velours Noire"" comes entirely from vines planted on the hillside on top of a black schist soil, which results in an incredibly velvety wine. The tannic profile is present, but not overwhelming, making this gorgeous bottle something to enjoy either now or a few years down the road. As for pairing, think roasted pork, duck, turkey, or BBQ lamb.
",Rhone Blends
"It is never to early to start thinking of cool wines to drink as nights get longer and more and more dinners get planned. This 100% Syrah on Black Schist soil should definitely be one to keep in your back pocket. Blackberry and spice on the nose give way to a rather rich and bold wine. Dark berry and jam notes are intertwined with spice and minerality while classic syrah tannin coats the mouth and leads to a long finish. This is not a shy wine in all the best ways.
",Rhone Blends
"No summer would be complete without this essential, K&L favorite rose. It is super aromatic and fruit forward showing juicy watermelon and fresh strawberry while remaining dry and refreshing. This rose is a no-brainer, and at $9.99 you can't beat it!
",Rhone Blends
"The depth and vigor of this Languedoc rose are seriously astounding for under $10.  Rich flavors of cherries, strawberries and watermelons with a round creaminess are amplified by a precise and lively acidity.  This, as in years past, is undoubtedly one of the best deals you will find anywhere in roses.
",Rhone Blends
"One of our longest standing and most successful relationships from the Languedoc is with Corinne Pastourel, the oenologist and director of the Les Vignerons de Fontès cooperative in the mountaine town of Fontès near Pezenas.  Corinne's vibrant personality is immediately intoxicating much like the wines she oversees.  Making a variety of wines, we have always been drawn to the ""Prieure Saint Hippolyte"" bottlings as they represent the freshness and vibrancy of the fruit from the local growers.  The rose is charming on first glance with its nose of strawberry, white flowers and red plums.  The palate is mouthfilling and not too delicate.  There is an almost serious weight to it but it finishes dry and refreshing, getting you ready for another sip.  The Hippolyte is still our best selling rose and still under $10 making this your year round pink drink!
",Rhone Blends
"When you taste a lot of rosés, you start to discover that many end up being forgettable. It's clean, it's dry, it's fresh--end of story. Not this one. It goes out of its way to be bigger and fruitier than every other rosé on the block. With the roaring aromatics coming out of this glass I totally would have expected a dull, flabby wine. But instead there's this beautiful acid profile that is refreshing and invigorates the fruit profile. At $10 this is a total standout on the rosé shelf.
",Rhone Blends
"Our best selling Rose every year since 2009.  This year could be their best to date.  It is on the drier side, with a bright reddish color. Plenty of flavor and all for $9.99.  It will sell quickly.I just drank a bottle of the 2014 and it was still bright and alive.  Who says Rose will not age?
",Rhone Blends
"Severine and Philippe Bourrier have generated incredible excitement and enthusiasm from our entire staff for their extraordinary range of finesse-driven wines from the Roussillon region. This bright, friendly and appealing red, brimful of spice and luscious plummy fruits, displays far more aromatic complexity and freshness than expected for its very modest price point. Pair with a  cheese and mushroom tart or Mediterranean cassoulet, or add it to your table at Thanksgiving. A winner all round!
",Rhone Blends
"This wine is beautiful , lush and delicious. It is soft and round with dark fruit flavors that have a sense of balance. Medium-to-full bodied, it is ready to drink now and is good alone or with hearty foods.
",Rhone Blends
"Superb little red food wine that is a great one to keep around the house for whenever. Tart red berry and fruit are layered here with bright acid and some great minerality. The acid really drives the wine, but there is some chewy tannin on the finish to help give the wine more structure.A very good choice to keep around for a delightfully inexpensive table wine.
",Rhone Blends
"The Caprice has been one of our best sellers over the last five years. The 2016 is full on fruit, with a classic nose of strawberries and lemon zest. It is supple on the palate and lingers beautifully. Perfect for light salads and roasted vegetables.

"""...my love, it's very late, 'til morning comes let's tessellate."" These lyrics by alt-J, an English indie rock band, were probably more about seduction than some nocturnal tiling project, but the words reminded me of just how much this tuneful blend of  Grenache, Syrah and Mourvedre continues to charm and seduce vintage after vintage. A revelation of ripe raspberries, blueberries and black cherries fills the glass with enticing aromas, and the sumptuous flavors carry over with spice and floral notes on the round, lavish and sweetly rich palate. The only instrument you need to employ to fully enjoy this  harmonious wine? A corkscrew......

"Like all Lafage wines, there is no shortage of fruit in the GSM.  The wine has the sensation of warm raspberry coulis drizzled over a berry compote.  It almost sounds like a little much but Lafage excels at creating finesse where fruit lingers.  Great acidity, plush velvety tannins and glycerol richness lead you to believe this is a much more expensive wine and gives you the balance you desire.  The name Jean-Marc Lafage has become synonymous with cost to quality in our stores.  Every wine is inflected with his joyously exuberant style.  For wines that you can drink every day that show pure pleasure in the glass, you need look no further than Lafage's harmonious Grenache Syrah Mourvedre blend.
",Rhone Blends
"Seriously, Jean-Marc Larfage is just killing it right now. In addition to being one of the most in-demand consulting winemakers in France, he continues to put out unbelievable values from his region of specialty: the Languedoc and Roussillon. Take for instance the 2015 Tessellae. Farmed from over 100  year-old-vines, this wine is utterly delicious, displaying flavors of raspberry coulis and bing cherries above a darker, medium bodied blackberry fruit. Hints of charcoal, smoke, and well-integrated spice contribute to a nuanced aroma. It is warm, upfront, fruity and an incredibly well-made wine that will work with plenty of different types of cuisines and is good for any night of the week. I would argue that at this moment, Lafage is producing the best value wines anywhere in the world. If you’ve loved the Kerbuccio, Bastide Miraflors, or Arqueta from Domaine Lafage, you should definitely pick up the Tessellae.
",Rhone Blends
"This is my favorite Lafage release to date! The 2015 Tessellae Old Vines GSM has a hauntingly beautiful nose of red cherries, licorice, white pepper and garrigue. On the palate the wine is fresh and lively with great energy and drive. There is copious fruit notes as well as spice with a layered and complex palate. The wine shows excellent integration of its tannins, fruit and alcohol which gives this full-bodied wine a deceptively light on its feet feel.
",Rhone Blends
"I think of all the years that we have been directly importing the wines from this very old estate, their regular Côtes-du-Rhônes have been of consistent superb high quality and drinking extremely well in the near-term. This 2014 not only continues that evolution, but I feel may be the best that they have produced to date. Rich in appearance with a medium-deep ruby robe, the flashy, bright nose offers aromas of blackberry, violets, white pepper, anise, and mocha, with background notes of forest floor and filings. In its broad, juicy palate presentation you will be treated to a Gem that is beautifully balanced, lush, and silky, yet provides exceptional structure and depth of flavor that leads to a long, almost creamy finish. Although this Gem drinks wonderfully now, it will age and “improve” for another four to eight years. Rusty and I love this Gem, regardless of its price point, and plan to make it one of our house reds for however long it is available. A LUSH AND SILKY VALUE!  …..A K&L WINE MERCHANTS’ DIRECT IMPORT….. ***** 14.0% ABV *****

"Hands down, the Chateau De Montfaucon Cotes Du Rhone is one of the greatest values at K&L. With a higher percentage of Grenache, there is a beautiful aroma of Garrigue and a rich mouthfeel, with great potential for aging evident in the structure of the wine.
",Rhone Blends
"This over-achieving wine has been a best seller at K&L for close to 15 years and it seems to get better every vintage.  Asian spice, garrigue, nori, a touch of licorice and an array of red fruits and berries come alive in this snappy and clean value.  This is amazingly complex for the money.
",Rhone Blends
"Bright cherry upfront with underlying dark raspberry fruit, the Montfaucon Côtes du Rhône is straightforward and easy-drinking, but with enough depth and licorice spice to feel more luxurious than your typical twelve dollar red.  This producer is always a favorite and their flavorful 2014 release does not disappoint.
",Rhone Blends
"This is a very congenial wine from the Cotes du Rhone that shows rich, ripe red berries on the nose yet on the palate there is a tartness to the fruit and the essence of sweet spices and earth. A fantastic everyday red!
",Rhone Blends
"In the world of value-priced red wines, I'd put Cotes du Rhones on the short list of ever present bargains. Back when ten bucks seemed like a lot of money for a bottle of wine, I drank a lot of them. You could find them everywhere: Trader Joe's, Safeway, etc. They were usually good and rarely did I get a bad one. But in that world of value-priced Cotes du Rhones, there is still a hierarchy. At the top of that pyramid for me is Montfaucon. In the ever-expanding universe of $10-$15 wines, this one never gets old. The fruit is always juicy, yet restrained. The flavors are balanced, yet forward. The quality is there, yet the price never goes up. This is the quintessential French bistro wine. It pairs with just about anything and it always tastes delicious. What more can you say about dependability?
",Rhone Blends
"Every year, I am always impressed by the consistent, classic quality of this wine.  Plenty of pretty red fruit, surrounded by subtle smoky spices, with a touch of earthy goodness.  This is how classic Cotes du Rhone should be made.
",Rhone Blends
"It doesn’t get much better than this for everyday reds.  Lighter in weight than the Lirac and the Baron Louis, it still displays rich Grenache flavors of blackberry and plum with smooth tannins rounded out by a long, crisp, savory and raspberry finish.  At this price it’s worth buying a case—it never fails to please a crowd!
",Rhone Blends
"The Montfaucon Cotes du Rhone is always a personal favorite of mine, but I was pleasantly surprised by this one in particular, as 2014 was an especially challenging vintage in the Rhone Valley. Although it's not as big-shouldered as more recent vintages, it certainly is not lacking. There's plenty of juicy cherry and raspberry fruit in a more elegant and approachable frame. This is an ideal house wine that always exceeds its price point.
",Rhone Blends
"A stellar Southern French red-blend from our friends at Domaine de la Réserve d'O. The winery is both certified Ecocert Organic and Demeter Biodynamic, and that is reflected in the grace and depth of this cuvee of 2015 ‘La Réserve d'O.’ Aromas initially of black currant and blackberry, along with garrigue, smoked meat, and licorice on the back end. On the palate, the dark fruit arrives once more, though this time in there is also a presence of red fruit like plum and raspberry. Cocoa powder and black pepper flavors are present on the finish. A beautifully well-integrated wine, with both power and finesse. Nice when drunk on its own, but also quite versatile with regards to food pairing application. Our staff who visited the winery in Languedoc enjoyed this with local blood sausage and an onion & apple chutney. Everything from pork chops to grilled chicken to veal, this wine will fit right in at your dinner table

"With her down-to-earth warmth and embrace of non-interventionist winemaking, Marie Chauffray of Domaine De La Reserve d’O manifests the abiding ethos of the Vinifilles, an accomplished coterie of amazing women winemakers in the Languedoc-Roussillon. She and her husband relinquished their safe life as owners of a wine shop, and spent a decade scouring the rugged countryside for the perfect site to grown their own. They found it in the high, windswept Terrasses du Larzac appellation, where her biodynamic, terroir-driven wines, grown on poor clay and calcareous soils are uniquely defined by their refreshing aromatic profiles and intense flavors. Her 2015 La Reserve d’O  is a compelling blend of Syrah, Grenache and Cinsault, with alluring black fruit aromas leading to an expansive palate of blackcurrant, cherries, licorice, cocoa and baking spice. Certainly one of the most harmonious wines I've tasted this year.
",Rhone Blends
"When I started here at K&L, Domaine de la Reserve d'O was one of the first direct imports I loved from the Languedoc. There is not only a female winemaker, but the estate vineyard is certified biodynamic and organic and the wines have minimal sulfur added. This wine is a blend all estate fruit, mostly Syrah and Grenache with a touch of Cinsault. This wine if playful, approachable and expressive with a great balance of savoriness, dark fruits and spice.
",Rhone Blends
"The 2014 was one of the first wines I took home when I first starting working at K&L. Its still an absolute knock-out of a wine. The 2015 is highly aromatic and intensely expressive. I found notes of tar, plum, vanilla and cherry with just a hint of bacon fat. Sweet and spicy, but clean and polished this wine is big on decadent fruit, and makes for delicious drinking. One of my go-to wines for customers because it never fails to show spectacularly.
",Rhone Blends
"I still rank my meeting with Marie and Fred Chauffray as one of the great ""gets"" in my career as a wine buyer for K&L.  We were introduced to each other through our mutual friend Francoise Antech-Gazeau of Maison Antech, one of our sparkling wine producers from the south of France.  The Chauffray's and Francoise are a part of an association of growers known as the Vinifilles, or wine women.  When I first tasted their wine at a Vinifilles event, I had to meet them.  So a couple of years later and a few hundred cases now sold, we have just landed the 2015 vintage, one of the most eagerly anticipated yet.  The wine begins as its normal charming self filled with a savory nose of roasted plum, black cherries, allspice and clove.  It has an almost Cote Rotie expressiveness.  On the palate, the wine carries tremendous weight but no heaviness.  Like most of the 2015s of the south, it is a little riper and a little more polished than previous vintages.  Even though its more concentrated, the wine holds it balance beautifully and I would begin drinking with aplomb, but that concentration will yield some longevity and I only see years of development and complexity to come.  So, adding to my collection of Reserve d'O wines, I will happily drink half my case now and watch the rest evolve gracefully for many more years to come.  Bravo Marie and Fred! I am still so grateful our paths crossed.

"This wine a great option for choosing an early drinking red. Planted on clay and limestone soils, the vines possess an average age of 30 years. Initial aromas of red fruit and raspberry, typical of a youthful Grenache-dominated wine. Along with the aromatics, there is an inherent freshness on the palate, supported by tannins discreet and supple. This easy drinking wine goes well with an assortment of food items; think cold cuts, grilled meats, and fresh cheeses.

"Domaine de Verquiere came to my attention earlier this past year, and I was amazed at the elegance and quality of the wines coming from this small, family-owned winery. Their wines tend to favor Grenache, but the Sablet also features Syrah, Mourvedre, and Cinsault, which makes for a bolder expression. The wine is medium bodied, with fine tannin and silky red fruit, accented by clay and spice notes. While not, perhaps, carrying the prestige of a larger producer in a more famous region, Domaine de Verquiere has quietly achieved a reputation with our staff of true, hand-crafted excellence that outshines its modest price.
",Rhone Blends
"The Southern Rhone is veritably bursting with vibrant, beautifully cultivated fruit, and some of the finest red values are to be found in Villages wines from Rasteau, Seguret and of note, the picturesque little town of Sablet. Crafted from organic fruit grown on well-draining clay and limestone, this is a pitch-perfect blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvedre: round, full-bodied and satisfying, with notes of black cherry, spice and licorice. Another wonderful wine from the remarkable Verquiere estate. Pair it with a thick cheeseburger slathered in mushrooms.
",Rhone Blends
"Stunning! This is such an impressive wine for this price point. Packed with plenty of black and red fruits, nicely integrated tannins and acidity that balances, there is incredible structure and complexity in this bottle for only $9! Give this a little air and see how beautifully it opens up. Wow!

"Languedoc aficionados take note: the 2015 Closerie is a remarkably delicious wine with rich, layered fruit and  graceful power.The Closerie empitomizes the “new world style” of wines currently streaming from the Languedoc, where recent years have seen tremendous advances in winemaking and quality. This is blend of Grenache aged in concrete and Syrah aged in both new and 2nd-fill French barriques.  The result is a silky wine with a concentration of dark fruit flavors, with a mild, tasteful oak influence. Smooth and accessible, yet still bold, this is a must have for those who love powerful reds from Southwest France.

"The 2015 Chateau Puech-Haut ""La Closerie du Pic"" Coteaux du Languedoc Pic Saint Loup is a limpid red in the glass with enticing aromas of red cherry, raspberry, minerals and spice. The palate is a complex offering of red fruits, spice notes, crushed rocks and the slightest hint of oak. There’s great energy and grace to this wine as it slowly unwinds on the palate. A great value, this is one of the best offerings from the Languedoc I have tasted this year.
",Rhone Blends
"We've had a lot of stellar Rhone-inspired French reds of late that I've really enjoyed, but this has quickly become my favorite.  Puech Haut's Closerie du Pic could easily sub in for a $60 bottle of top vintage, highly rated Chateaneuf in a blind tasting.  There's great focus, purity, minerality, and depth here even after the cork is just pulled, but it evolves beautifully in the glass and deserves a short decant at this stage of the game.  This is one that anybody who enjoys a beautiful bottle of Rhone-inspired wine should grab hold of.

"What a scrumptious bottle of wine! Roasted plums, ripe blackberries and raspberries, a  hint of black licorice, and spice and herbal notes, this is expressive and bursting with so much flavor and depth — a surefire hit at any dinner table or friendly gathering.
",Rhone Blends
"Winemaker Coralie Onde over-delivers with this sexy but supple Vacqueyras.  Loads of juicy berry flavors of cherry, roasted plum and dried blueberry are layered on the palate followed by garrigue-y spice that leads to a palate that is full yet deftly balanced.   This wine is as charming and exciting as its producer and we can't get enough of it.
",Rhone Blends
"The 2015 Ganse does an exquisite job of walking the fine line between power of fruit and elegance of balance. The blend is 70% Grenache and 30% Syrah and its nose leans towards perfume and nuanced spice. The palate shows gracefully restrained ripe plums and figs, managing to keep the wine in balance and expressive. Concentrated and full of latent energy this is a wine I would easily drink tonight, but would only expect to improve in the next 5-10 years.

"Ventoux is one of those appellations that often confuses many a wine-enthusiast.  Most don't know where it is or what it's about.  The region sits on the southeastern end of the Rhone appellation just below Mont Ventoux.  It is to the east of Gigondas and south of all the other Cotes du Rhone appellations.  This oversized region has a diversity of microclimates and soil types that heavily influence the individual estates of the region and are less affected by vintage variation.  Pesquie sits above 300 meters between the Mediterranean to the south and the Alps just to the north.  Mont Ventoux is part of the pre-alps and is the largest mountain in the region.  This confluence of mountain and Mediterranean is what makes the terroir and wines of Pesquie so special.  The wine itself is a beauty of brambly black fruit, Indian spices, toasty tobacco and grilled meat.  This little savory wonder captures the essence of Ventoux with its cooler climate flavors emboldened by the warm Mediterranean afternoons.  A spectacular rendition from the Rhone.

"While the last vintage was delicious, it was a bit heavy-handed on the baked fruit. This 2013 feels much more balanced and a touch greener, with surprisingly bright acid and a hit of Provencal herbs. The fruit shows as more vivid blackberry, but retains the classic dark plum flavors and structure of previous releases. A perfect BBQ wine that still has enough brooding sophistication to impress dinner guests, Château Pesquié ""Terrasses"" is a value-priced summer staple to pair with meals well into cooler seasons as well.
",Rhone Blends
"The nose points towards savory characteristics: bloody, charcoal, charcuterie. A perfect pairing for a murder mystery. Dark and brooding, on the palate there are plenty of black fruits with a slightly sweet undertone. This is exactly the kind of wine I really like and will totally end up taking home on a Tuesday.

"We have been privileged to work with Chante Cigale for about 15 years now.  An estate on the rise, they have always been one of our favorite value conscious CDPs, offering great classic character in their wines with open flavors that expand in the glass.  They deliver the goods regardless of vintage.  I've visited the estate on three separate occasions but I first tasted the 2015 in barrel in early 2016.  It was piecemeal, with components coming from large foudre, to smaller barrique and concrete tank.  Each parcel spoke to the potential of the 2015 vintage and I felt deep in my bones that this was going to be one of the sensations of the vintage.  Earlier this year, 2017 that is, I paid a visit to check the progress of the the new wines and got to taste the now finished and bottled 2015.  The parts were harmonious showing depth, length and layers of the sweet polished fruit that are hallmarks of this exciting vintage.   Proprietor Alexandre Favier invited me to stay for a quick homemade lunch (his mother is a great cook) of blanquette de veau which we had with the 2016 Blanc (equally terrific) and this new vintage with some cheeses.  A wonderful way to while away the day.  Of course, Alex is a perfectionist and did not want to release the wine just then deciding to wait until later in the fall (now) and offered us our allocation.  Since we have been great supporters, we got a good slug but will it be enough?   You'll have to trust us that after you get the wine in early 2018 and you've had a chance to sample it, you'll be begging for more.  I've already started.

"The uniquely high iron content of the stony gravel and pebbly soils, coupled with the proximity to the Mediterranean creates wines of greater depth and concentration that would be expected in a region that straddles both the Rhone and Languedoc. After discovering the remarkable value found in the Ermitage Rouge for several vintages, the rosé proved just as delectable, flavorful and vibrant, framed with notes of ripe peach, strawberry and spice, with enough luscious acidity on the crisp, inviting finish. Open this delightful rosé on a picnic with cold roast chicken or a mouthwatering paella!

"La Liviniere is home to the finest vineyards in Minervois, and when Jean-Michel Cazes, owner of Chateau Lynch-Bages, set his eyes on the region, he knew it would produce wines of superior quality. Located along the foothills of la Montagne Noire, the vineyard is Southern facing and planted on soils that alternate with limestone and sandy marl, and experiences a large diurnal shift in temperature. The 2014 L'Ostal Cazes Grand Vin Minervois is a beautiful reflection of complex terroir, with blooming, dark notes of blackberry and black pepper, lavender and garrigue, lifted by a balanced acidity and floral notes of dried rose petal and hibiscus.
",Rhone Blends
"Minervois is perhaps my favorite up and coming southern French region. Traditional Rhone varietals (70% Syrah, 15% Carignan, 10% Grenache, 5% Mourvedre) are the building blocks here, providing a juicy core of red and blue berries. The cedar and black pepper of the Syrah stands forward, while the high-tone acidity of the Grenache provides a mouth-watering texture that finishes with a touch of spicy tannin. Excellent value.
",Rhone Blends
"Whether strange coincidence or amazing prescience, the elegant label on this bottle depicts a full solar eclipse, and the imposing, layered wine within evokes as much rapt attention and held breath as that phenomenon. To be expected I suppose from a legendary Bordeaux producer as Jean-Michel Cazes. Compromise or half-measures are hardly his game, and when he chose to make wines in the Languedoc, he selected the Minervois AOC, where the exposed warmth of the vineyards is amplified by a vast geological amphitheater of limestone and marl. The sheer integrity of the beautiful fruit in this wine, with a core of blackcurrants, fleshy plums, vanilla bean, subtle spice and wild lavender....eclipses my palate. Truly a remarkable wine today that will evolve into a memorable wine tomorrow.
",Rhone Blends
"It seems like everyday we're just getting in hit after hit from Southwest France. The L'Ostal is no exception. Having a soft-spot for Syrah, I particularly this love Syrah-based blend, rounded it out with Carignan as well as a touch of Grenache and Mouvedre. The Syrah gives the back bone of dark fruit, while the Carignan brings a light rustic touch that you won't find in Southern Rhone Blends. Original and delicious. It's definitely going in my mixed case of under $20 reds I take home every month.
",Rhone Blends
"My first trip to Minervois included a visit to the L'Ostal Cazes property.  Situated in the Cru appellation of Minervois La Liviniere, the property sits below the foothills of the Montagne Noire in a region surrounded by the classic garrigue forests of the south of France.   Old classical buildings make up the exterior of the estate but since this is a Jean-Michel Cazes property, the interiors are beautifully redesigned with the idea of delivering the purest and most expressive version of the fruit the vines yield.  After a brief tour of the winery, my group was treated to a little ride through the property.  We did some serious off-roading driving over hills and through creek beds (some full of water from the spring rains) more than once nearly driving off a cliff into one of the surrounding gullies.  When we reached a plateau that overlooked the greater part of Minervois, what makes La Liviniere special was revealed.  This plateau is made up of deep limestone and marl soils that lift it above the rest of the region.  This translates beautifully into the wines.  These calcareous soils help preserve the acidity in the grapes for a region that gets a lot of sun intensity and very little rainfall during the growing season.  Deliciously ripe but not overwhelmingly so, the ""Grand Vin"" also picks up the classic garrigue notes of lavendar, thyme and chaparral.  Supple black fruit, wild fennel and Mexican chocolate permeate the palate and sweet tannins lead to a long finish.  All throughout, acidity provides a spine to the wine keeping it on the fresher side.  JM Cazes has given us one of our most pristine examples of a Languedoc red but I expect no less since he is responsible for making Lynch Bages one of the most successful and iconic wines of Pauillac.  Expect to hear more great things about his property in the south.

"Smooth, easy drinking, and definitely a nice tasty wine to be poured at dinner parties, and it even makes a nice night cap. With the price and the overall quality of this wine, as far as I'm concerned, this is a 100 point wine right here.
",Rhone Blends
"The first thing to jump out about this spectacularly-priced gem is the color: clear cherry, with the fruit to back it up. There is an almost syrupy mouthfeel through the palate, reminiscent of kirsch, but enough bright acid to keep it lively.  Earthy, herbal brush notes and black pepper spice help balance, and there’s subtle yet defined structure through the finish. A classic, gorgeous Châteauneuf-du-Pape that showcases this coveted Rhône appellation’s traditional style while still feeling modern, Tourbillon is a holiday stunner.
",Rhone Blends
"Wow, yet another superb find from our Rhone leader! This Chateauneuf-du-pape is rather light on its feet.  I could tell from just looking at the glass itself, with that wonderful garnet hue, that I was in for a surprise.  I was mesmerized by that burst of black cherry, white pepper and exotic wood spice on the nose and entranced by cherry cola, red raspberry with the great concentration of acidity. Well integrated tannins made this an irresistible go-to for anyone who enjoys a super-pleasing palate. With Thanksgiving rapidly approaching, this is the perfect wine for the table!

"Whenever we taste wines at K&L, I typically open a bottle or two and send out an email to the staff asking them to head over to the tasting room to sample new products. This time was different. I was grabbing my co-workers by the sleeves and dragging them into the tasting bar for the Tourbillon Wines. Everyone needs to try these. The value is absolutely unbelievable for the price. Chateauneuf tends to get pretty pricey these days, and I’ve been finding less and less to love at affordable price points. The 2014 Tourbillon totally blew me away. It walks the line between modern and traditional in the most beautiful way with bright, clean fruit notes and just enough savory hints to make it captivating. Totally well-built and delicious enough to pop tonight, this is an absolute stellar wine that is soft, supple, earthy and gamey. Oh dang, this is good stuff.
",Rhone Blends
"This is one of those really cool wines at an awesome price... Lots of baking spices, a touch of rhubarb, a hint of leather, Grenache at it's finest! The roundness and depth of the lead varietal truly unfolds on the palate where the soft and supple fruit flavors shine. It's got the perfect richness, more typical of what Chateauneuf should taste like, with a loooooooong finish.
",Rhone Blends
"Bright in color and flavor, this sophisticated CDP displays a more delicate expression of Grenache with brilliant red cherry, herbs and seductive smoke and spice. The balance of fruit, acid and structure is all here. This is enjoyable today but will hold for several years. I appreciate when finesse and restraint are this present in a wine.
",Rhone Blends
"Tourbillon was introduced to us by our friend Cecile Chassagne, a very talented winemaker in her own right.  Cecile is based in the village of Sablet and has a handful of small parcels in Gigondas just to the south.  We love to rely on the recommendations of our friends and when Cecile introduced us to Tourbillon, there was no surprise that we were enchanted by the wine.  This Chateauneuf is pure pleasure in a glass showing the charm of the 2014 vintage with its near-term drinkability.  Aromas of cherry and wild strawberry erupt from the glass followed by whispers of brushy garrigue.  On the palate the wine has a medium-full weight with flavors of berry compote, oolong tea and potpourri.  The wine will drink beautifully for years to come but is so accessible now, it would be a shame to resist.  Factor in the price of $25 and you have one of the great Rhone buys of the year.
",Rhone Blends
"The rich and brawny style of Chante Cigale is slightly toned down in the lively 2014 vintage allowing for a bit more up front complexity to emerge even at this early stage.  There are undertones of darker fruit to go with the brighter flavors of red fruits, licorice, nori, Asian spice and roasted herb.  There is fantastic energy in this approachable and value priced CNP from a small family producer.  Drink tonight or lay a few bottles away.

"Some cicadas spend up to 17 years nestled underground in a state of asocial, arrested development, and when they finally emerge, boy are they ready to party! Blessed with powerful membranes that beat like miniature kettledrums, they are perhaps the loudest insects on earth, and spend the rest of their fleeting lives clinging to trees and singing their tiny hearts out to attract a mate. Humans adopt other methods, like opening a bottle of this lustrous Chateauneuf-du-Pape, aptly named for the little 'Pavarottis' that thrive in the region. Redolent with attractive, well-ripened black and red fruit aromas, this luscious wine expresses the warmth and enticing spice, garrigue and harmony of the Southern Rhone, and like the friendly song of the cicadas, is impossible to resist!
",Rhone Blends
"Typically, when I taste Chateauneuf-du-pape, I often ask myself whether the wine fits into the traditionalist or modernist grouping of Chateauneuf. This not to declare one better than the other, its simply way of distinguishing two different sets of objectives. Chante Cigale really nails the modernist style right on the head. When fruit, balance, and depth of flavor are the main focus of a wine and these elements are well-executed you get wines like the Chante Cigale. There's tons of dark fruit to this wine, clear and clean notes of black berry and blueberry are layered over a rich texture, with downplayed acidity and pleasing tannic structure. This packs a lot of punch for the price, and fans of power reds from the Languedoc and Roussillon should take note.

"Recently I had two of the most tremendous Chateauneufs at a dinner party and they affirmed why I fell in love with the wines from this region so long ago.  They were both served at a dinner party where the staple was multiple courses of beef cooked over Japanese charcoal.  The first was a 1995 Marcoux Vieilles Vignes that was seamless and I would put it easily in my top five CDPs of all time.  The second was a 2004 Clos Saint Jean Deux Ex Machina.  Not what the critics would qualify as a great vintage but easily one of the best wines I have ever tasted from Saint-Jean.  The wine was deep rich and showed more of the modern qualities of Chateauneuf.  The beauty was how it unfolded in waves of flavors and not one big chunk of balmy fruit.  It was gorgeous and went beautifully with the fattier cuts of meat.  So what about this 2015?  Well after tasting an retasting - I found qualities from both of those great wines in what is surely the most harmonious Vieilles Vignes I have yet tasted.  A beautiful panoply of spices unfolds followed by layers of rich but not over-ripe fruit leading to a long and lingering finish.  Like I've been saying, 2015 has produced wines that scale back the opulence but bring out the layers.  The Clos Saint Jean VV is a worthy addition to any collector's cellar and it will surely be a part of mine.

"K&L has been selling the wines of Moulin de la Gardette in Gigondas since the mid-90's. They have become a staple of our southern Rhone portfolio, a favorite of staff and customers alike. Imagine our excitement, then, at the arrival of a brand new wine, carried by us for the first time, the 2016 Petite Gardette. A 50/50 blend of Grenache and Syrah, sourced from the younger vines on the estate, and vinified and aged without oak. Juicy, bright and fresh and utterly drinkable. And while I like to pretend as a wine professional that I am above such things, I am absolutely in love with the label.
",Rhone Blends
"I have been a loyal fan of Gardette Gigondas since the great 1998 vintage yet had never tried this bargain price cuvee fashioned from their younger vines.  Simply put: WOW.  Perhaps this lacks the density of the more expensive bottlings but all of the ripe cherry, berry and spiced raspberry fruit is there in spades along with aromas of earth, potpourri and roasted herb.  This is just as complex and delicious as its bigger brothers just a bit more user friendly.

"If you love the other Moulin de la Gardette wines from Gigondas producer JB Meunier as much I do, then please get acquainted with his newest offering, ""Petite Gardette"". Made with fruit from younger vines, this is packed with red and black fruits, spice, and has beautiful length and structure. The wine experiences zero oak - it is vinified and aged in stainless steel. Again, JB has crafted a wine with powerful personality yet plenty of freshness, showcasing that signature restraint and finesse that makes everything he produces so pleasing. Pro tip: decant and let breathe before indulging!
",Rhone Blends
"Although this wine continues to improve and fill out with time in the bottle, currently I'd recommend decanting it or giving it plenty of time to open up. It's packed with loads of spiced red and black fruit, ripe tannins and just the right amount of acidity that adds to its freshness and length. It's a very impressive red and one of the best deals within our Rhone selection. Open with aeration or give it a bit of time to round out in the cellar.
",Rhone Blends
"A spectacular every day offering from my favorite Gigondas producer the Petite Gardette showcases the beauty of this area and the producer. Although there is a little funk on the nose when first opening this bottle a half and hour decant time will give you a beautiful wine. Very pretty ripe berry mixed with a nice amount of earth lead to a lovely clean finish. Everything here is in harmony and the balance of the fruit, acid, and tannin mean this is a perfect food wine.

"Winemaker Nicolas Haeni has much in common with the good folks to the north at Clos de la Bonnette, as his elevated, heavily terraced vines demand the same fervent energy and fortitude to achieve his vision of a quintessential Rhône red.

"There's something really special and unique about Cecile Chassagne's 2015 Gigondas that sets it apart from other Gigondas wines I've had from various producers. This is definitely one of the prettiest Gigondas blends I've had, and one of my personal favorites that we carry in the store. Beautifully balanced acidity, and flavors of raspberry make this blend a very pleasant experience, even for those who normally don't drink wine every day. I opened this bottle up with my roommate who's not a wine guy, but he thought this was one of the best bottle of wines he ever had. Definitely worth a whirl.

"Another knock-out from one of my favorite direct imports.    Wine has been made at the Chateau de Montfaucon since 1520, and that kind of legacy results in superbly crafted blends year after year.  This Cotes du Rhone blanc is no exception.  The mostly Clairette blend has a viscous tropical fruitiness with a nice floral undertone from the Viognier.  Great acid and mineral keep it fresh on the finish which is precise and lingering. One of the very best deals in white in the store. 
",Rhone Blends
"Another fantastic wine from our friends at Montfaucon! This lovely Cote du Rhone Blanc is composed mostly of very old-vine Clairette, which lends a lovely texture and strength to the wine.

"Quite the serious rosé relative to the under-$20 price point! Expansive aromas of watermelon, blood orange, lychee, and white cherry along with a bouquet of strawberry crème anglaise and rose petal. I really enjoyed the palate; it possessed quite a nice juiciness and elevated acidity that would be perfect as an aperitif or paired with food. The wine is rounder than initially perceived; accompanied along with some tannins that provide structure to the rosé. A nice bridge between the clean and crisp rosé wines of Côtes de Provence and the more structured offerings from Tavel

"The 2015 vintage is pure and deep, landing some of the highest critical praise to date.

"Sophie remains a strong advocate for her native Carignan grape, believing that if properly cultivated and kept to low yields it can make extraordinary wines. And the evidence is there, for year after year her Carignan-based wines engage with their superb fruit, delineation and charm. Her 2015 Lolo de l’Anhe is a blend of Carignan, Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre. Direct, appealing and honest, with bright, enticing notes of raspberry, violets, wild thyme and kitchen spice, this is a wine for the picnic basket or by the grill.

"I fell in love with this wine because the ""kitchen spice"" aromatics and flavors remind me of the smells coming out of the kitchen on a cool, lazy fall day. It is composed of 81% Carignan, which gives the wine a great ""lift,"" (think raspberry bush) and the rest is Grenache, Syrah, Mourvedre, which round out the blend very nicely. Don't be fooled by the word ""Carignan"", though, the wine has tons of depth, great displays of darker fruits, and a long, elegant finish. Although I would consider it full bodied, you could pair this bottle with anything from roasted chicken to pizza, burgers, meatloaf, lasagna, etc. Enjoy!

"At my visit to the Millesime Bio Organic Wine Fair this past February, I had a chance to catch up with Sophie and her remarkable wines.  Sophie excels with her non-intervention style producing wines reflective of her beautiful terroir in Corbieres all while farming organically.  Oh yeah, and she does it all by herself!    The 2014 was a rousing success with its polished tannins and lithe structure.  The 2015 sits more generously in bottle than the 2014 though.  Deeper purple fruit and a more intense perfume on the nose still finds a wine with beautiful polish but more heft and generosity.  I expect the 2015 to have a long life ahead of it but it is such a pleasure to drink now.

"Sophie Guiraudon, the engaging force of nature behind Clos de l’Anhel, belongs to an affiliation of savvy women vignerons in the Languedoc, “The Vinfilles”, who consent to being “adepts of the pleasure and richness of their profession, beautiful, rebellious, active, greedy, friendly, sociable and dynamic.” All of the above. When we had the opportunity to meet Sophie last year, she poured her latest wines and enthralled all with her deep knowledge of the,Corbieres region and its amazing tapestry of soils and microclimates. The Terrassettes satisfies on many levels, as a great everyday red of course, but like many of her wines, has the structure and balance to mature over several years. Rich and robust plum, raspberry, earth and spice flavors meld beautifully on the firm palate, with polished tannins and splendid acidity. All of the rebellious, sociable and friendly qualities you could ask for in a wine!

"During the last fourteen years of his life painter Henri Matisse, all but confined to his bed by serious illness, created some of the most powerful and liberating works in modern art— papiers découpés, or paper cutouts, brightly colored organic forms that echoed tropical flowers, luxuriant gardens, the harmonious beauty and breadth of the natural world. What does all this have to do with a wine note, you might ask? Well, wine too is an evocation of the natural world, and all that is learned in the field and contemplated in the cellar leaves its distinctive impress in the bottle and ultimately, in your glass. And since our rosé selection is pretty extensive, a gentle nod toward this one or that one might help. La Chapelle en Rose is an exceptional, limited cuvée dry rosé honoring the 11th century chapel that looks over the vineyard, an homage, according to the winemaker, to the soft pink hues picked up by the stonework as the sun descends. Nothing shy here though, as this provocative rosé has lovely freshness and precision in its wild strawberry, lush apricot and scintillating, mint-enhanced flavors. Pair with savory crab cakes or a seafood aioli for an unforgettable delight! Old Matisse would look up from his colorful cuttings and salute you with a smile!

"This Delicious Grenache, Syrah and Mourvedre rosé comes from the brilliant minds at Bonny Doon, who cleverly reference the fabled UFO citings of the Rhône in their label. Randal Grahm takes a hands off approach to winemakeing, which allows the natural characteristics of the fruit to shine through. The Alta Loma and Beeswax Vineyards in Monterey provide the fruit, which creates distinctive richness and complexity in the wine. Aromas of peony, Ripe strawberry and stony mineral tantalize, and just may transport you to another galaxy.

"I've had the good fortune to try 2014 on a number of occasions now and I continue to find myself totally stunned by the quality. Beautiful aromatics of black pepper and spice with just a hint of beautifully integrated oak, finishing with garrigue--the kind you only get from Languedoc wines. Looking at the varieties, I'm so surprised by the weight and body on the palate. It's light, fresh, and acid-driven in a way will kill with a good meal. Fresher and more acidic than blends from the Southern Rhone, and more interesting and complex than new-world blends, its a consummate reminder that Minervois produces exceptional wines that deserve a place at the table.

"I fell in love with the last vintage of this wine, which was a 50-50 split of Syrah and Grenache.

On top of this, beautiful red fruit, bright acidity and overall smoothness has lured me in once again.

"The d'Albas team led by Graham Nutter has been doing some terrific things with this beautiful estate in Minervois.  Nutter retired from the finance grind in London and fled to the small hamlet of Laure-Minervois.  Of course he is a dedicated worker and upon finding this estate began his second career restoring the property and renovating the winery and castle.  Some replanting took place, organic farming became the mainstay and Syrah (one of Graham's favorite grapes) took the lead position.  The ""Chateau"" bottling is the winery's namesake wine representing the quality of the Minervois appellation.  The wine has a gorgeous nose of potpourri, dried tobacco and black cherries.  It is saturated and mouthfilling but never heavy or clumsy.  Great acid structure and balance, it finishes long giving you the sense that you are drinking a wine valued at twice the price.  The ""Chateau"" wine is one of my favorite Rhone-styled values at the moment representing the synergy that Grenache and Syrah can have when handled with a deft and dedicated hand.

The palate is well-structured with a deep, dark blast of black fruit that totally consumes the palate. This is a wine that pushes big fruit to the brink while managing to keep the rest of its elements intact. Elegant wines go home. This one doesn't pull punches.

"A visit to this winery a few years ago led to a trek through one of the most distinct vineyard sites I have visited in southern France.  The famous ""Brown Schist"" of Maury is so distinct it looks like the ethereal moonscape of some otherworldly planet.  Climbing up to the top of a hill in the center of the vineyard, I was surrounded by all this fragmented rock as though a quarry had dumped all of its contents into one giant pile.  It's obvious to see why importer/vigneron Dan Kravitz was drawn to it and why he had to purchase the land.  Each year, Dan and his team have fashioned some of the Roussillon's most distinct and enjoyable reds from the region.  And each year, the Serge & Nicolas has over-delivered for its price.  A gorgeous nose of blueberries, violets, garrigue and spices erupt from the glass.  It is bold and genuine with its overt profile.  This Maury makes no secret that it is from a distinctly warm climate but the acidity and tannins keep it all focused and balanced.  It also doesn't hurt that the tremendous 2015 vintage graced the landscape of Roussillon like so many other of France's appellations.  Irregardless of vintage, the Cabirau is always sensational and continues to provide its consumers with a wine of twice the quality for half the price.
",Rhone Blends
"What a tasty, tasty blend, and at a fantastic price.  The smaller percentages of Syrah and Carignan give this Grenache-heavy blend perfect balance and structure.
",Rhone Blends
"Yes, it is true what Joe said in the earlier review of this wine.  I was impressed - very impressed.  There is something so special about the Priorat region, truly an area that expresses great terroir.  You get generous fruit combined with unique minerality from the soils.  On the nose I got ripe black cherry, plum, black pepper and licorice.  On the palate concentrated lush black and red fruits, dried flowers and a balance of minerality that only Priorat offers.
",Rhone Blends
"This is Priorat!! My colleague Chantel and I tasted the 2014 Mas Doix Salanques earlier today and were both impressed - very impressed. While we come to expect rich fruit and structured tannins in Priorat at this price, what made both of us take notice was the extraordinary energy and freshness of the wine, combined with a tactile feel of minerals. While I don't go around licking Llicorella (Catalan dialect for slate) this wine has the feel of a richly fruited Mediterranean red with a tight mineral core. I love it because it's so generous and delicious now, with loads of lively black cherry and raspberry flavors and sweet violet florals lingering on the palate as well. A phenomenal Priorat.
",Rhone Blends
"One of, if not my wine of the vintage. When I tasted this in2016 from the oak tank, it was one of the most exotic and perfumedyoung CdPs I had ever tasted. When tasted earlier this year, it wasagain revelatory. Concentrated yet refreshing, with so much gorgeousfruit and spice, the wine is beginning to firm up around the edges. Iwould not say the wine will shut down, but there are signs that 5–10years in bottle will reward those who cellar it with a truly exceptionalwine.
",Rhone Blends
"No summer would be complete without this essential, K&L favorite rosé. It is super aromatic and fruit forward, showing juicy watermelon and fresh strawberry while remaining dry and refreshing. This rosé is a no-brainer, and at $9.99 (1.5-liter $19.99) you can't beat it!
",Rhone Blends
"One of our longest-standing and most successful relationships from the Languedoc is with Corinne Pastourel, the oenologist and director of the Les Vignerons de Fontès cooperative in the mountaine town of Fontès near Pezenas. Corinne's vibrant personality is immediately intoxicating much like the wines she oversees. We have always been drawn to the ""Prieure Saint Hippolyte"" bottlings as they represent the freshness and vibrancy of the fruit from the local growers. The rosé is charming on first glance with its nose of strawberry, white flowers and red plums. The palate is mouthfilling and not too delicate. There is an almost serious weight to it but it finishes dry and refreshing, getting you ready for another sip. The Hippolyte is still our best-selling rosé and still under $10 (and under $20 for the 1.5L) making this your year-round pink drink!
",Rhone Blends
"Our best selling rosé every year since 2009. This year could be their best to date. It is on the drier side, with a bright reddish color. Plenty of flavor and all for $19.99 for 1.5L. It will sell quickly. I just drank a bottle of the 2014 and it was still bright and alive. Who says rosé will not age?

"Wine evokes so many memories. Spent a blistering summer many years ago working a commune in the Massif des Maures in Provence, where the day ended with a nightly brushing away of sweet baby scorpions who managed to congregate in my small tent as if it were a cathedral to the god Arthropoda. Wine was liberally consumed by all to abate the torrid heat, but I never indulged the lovely wines of Rimauresq, nestled in the foothills but a sparrow's flight away. Captive to the cooling Mistral, the vineyards lie sedately in the shadow of the Massif, often maturing two weeks later than their neighbors, which allows for lustrous ripening of the six grape varieties that go into this stunning rose. Tightly spun aromas of  vibrant red fruits and citrus peel enwreathe a palate of creamy strawberry richness, floral jasmine notes and ravishing mineral complexity. To sum up, this is one of the finest Provencal roses we carry, and a worthy companion to a  wide array of dishes from salad nicoise to grilled tuna.
",Rhone Blends
"Rimauresq is an historic property that sits at the foot of the Massif des Maures mountain range.  Their microclimate is influenced by the surrounding hills creating a unique terroir that is cooler than many of the other neighboring properties.  That and the varied soils of sand and gravel create wines with great tension and nuance.  With all of these things, one can see what makes this property so special.  When I first tasted this wine early in the season (beginning of  March), I was taken with the layered structure.  It showed more like a Bandol rose with light color and superb balance.  It was still a little tight though but the potential was amazing.  Now it's June and I revisited the wine and after a little relaxing in bottle this rose has achieved everything I could have hoped for.   There is a firm raspberry backbone with the texture of white cherry and a hint of fresh bay leaf on the palate.  The wine has real depth and structure with mouth watering acidity and nerve.  This is no soft and fruity rose, this is serious stuff...  but not to be taken too seriously.  It is rose after all and enjoyment is its primary function.  This is a case buy for sure with bottles to be enjoyed for this year and well into the next.
",Rhone Blends
"This is one of the most exciting Provence rosés I've tasted this year. The nose is super clean and bright, full of cherry and lemon zest. The palate is refreshing and creamy at the same time. It just begs for food -- perhaps BBQ chicken and grilled veggies. The finish lingers pleasantly and is quite long. Big time win in the Provence category!
",Rhone Blends
"This is bone-dry, fresh and crunchy rosé made with 43% Grenache Noir, 24% Cinsault, 10% Mourvedre, 8% Syrah, 6% Carignan and 9% Rolle. It starts with aromas of barberry, pink rose petal and hint of strawberry, on the palate it's super mineral and full of juicy grapefruit with touch of pomelo on the finish.
",Rhone Blends
"Bright with strawberry fruit, Domaine Rimauresq is a classic yet complex Provençal rosé with refreshing acidity. The 2016 is rich enough to feel fuller bodied on the palate than most, yet still shows lively pithy notes and stony minerality, plus a long finish. The texture is surprisingly soft for such a juicy, lifted rosé, making this a great food wine and a nuanced option.
",Rhone Blends
"Absolutely lovely Provencal Rose that will be perfect for almost any occasion this Summer. It is bright and high acid, while still showcasing brilliant fruit and minerality. A good balanced, lighter style wine that stands out apart from many of the other Provence Roses out there.
",Rhone Blends
"Beautiful aromas of cherries, raspberries and hints of fresh cut pineapple greet you and then seamlessly lead into a gorgeous palate of fresh floral notes as well as strawberry and mineral notes. Crisp acidity and soft tannins round out this stunning Rose. An excellent Provencal Rose.
",Rhone Blends
"Totally loving this wine right now. There are beautiful floral aroma drifting from the glass, but on the palate--all strawberries and cream. This wine fits neatly into the Provence rose category but with a an interesting twist. The acid is forward and refreshing, but the real star here is the texture. There is a beautiful richness to this wine that makes it absolutely stand out among its peers. Crisp, balanced, and beautifully textured this is flat-out one of the best roses I've had this season.
",Rhone Blends
"Classic Provencal rose with the soft red berry fruit, crisp and clean acidity, and juicy, mouthwatering finish we're all looking for in our summertime daily drinkers. The Rimauresq dials it up a notch, however, it terms of quality. There's a bit more finesse, depth, and concentrated complexity here than in the standard $10-$15 fare. It's definitely worth the extra few bucks. I could drink this all month long and never get tired of it.
",Rhone Blends
"This is the perfect choice for those who are looking for classic Provence style rose, with that super mineral-driven quality.  This has flavors of chalk, wet river rocks, rose petals, yet with a soft, rich texture that adds a layer of complexity.
",Rhone Blends
"This fat, juicy, grapey, grenache-driven wine that is singing right now.  The restrained usage of new oak is the key. The vanilla tones are subtle, but the barrel aging really softens the tannins giving you a smooth and silky CdP that you can drink right now.

"Alex Pross and I were in the Rhone Valley back in March doing some procuring for K&L and one of our best visits was with the Perrin Family's various properties.  It was both our first visit to Chateau de Beaucastel, the flagship property, and it did not disappoint.  The winery is both historically interesting and as far as production goes, immaculate.  It's no surprise that they consistently make one of the best wines in Chateauneuf-du-Pape.  We followed that visit with a drop in to the Perrin's other wine production facility just outside of Chateauneuf for a broad tasting of all their other wines.  We finished our tour by heading to one of two Perrin restaurants in the middle of the village of Gigondas.  On our way into town we had a quick look at the Clos des Tourelles vineyard as you cannot miss it when entering the village.  I bring this up because, the Perrin family does not do anything by half measures.  Their commitment in the south of France on Miraval is excelling.  Beaucastel continues to be the benchmark property in Chateauneuf du Pape.  Their appellation wines under the Famille Perrin label are each top renditions of their respective terroirs,  Both restaurants in Gigondas are exceptional from their basic wine bar ""Nez!"" to the finer dining ""l'Oustalet.""  So, when Perrin decides to procure one of the top vineyards in Gigondas, you have to know that the end result will be something truly special.  The first commercial vintage of this wine produced is the 2010.  Not a bad vintage to start with (it's actually a pretty terrific vintage).  We found a stash in the importer's warehouse and made them what seemed to be an insane offer on a take all deal.  Wanting to move forward to subsequent vintages, they said ""yes.""  Aside from an exciting price, the key component on our side was to see where the wine stood in its evolution.  A quick pull of the cork and the wine was on fire.  With a few years of bottle age, the wine has developed great complexity, showing layers of sweet black fruit, exotic spices and burnished leather.  Structurally, this wine still has at least another decade plus of evolution ahead of it, but now is a great time to check-in for you earlier drinkers.  Much like their Beaucastel property, Domaine du Clos des Tourelles will represent what is sure to be a new benchmark wine for Gigondas.  And like all the other Perrin projects, there are no half-measures, only great wines.
",Rhone Blends
"A back vintage from one of my favorite southern Rhone appellations by the renowned producer of the Beaucastel line?  I had a feeling this would be good, and it is!  The richness of the vintage is evident with robust, savory, ripe strawberry and raspberry jam flavors,  with fully integrated wild herb and garrigue notes.  It has great weight and richness on the palate and just the right amount of acid to cut all that rich fruit.  A+ for style, structure, drinkability, and further aging potential.
",Rhone Blends
"Most of the time when I sit down to write about a wine it is a bit young and could use at least a few more years in the bottle in order for it to truly shine, for once I actually get to review a wine that is in a perfect drinking window! The 2010 Famille Perrin “Domaine de Clos des Tourelles” Gigondas is a fantastic wine, seductive aromas of fig jam, black licorice and spice cake deftly rise from the glass. Richly-textured on the palate this full-bodied wine displays gorgeous black fruit, plum, cola and spice flavors with silky tannins and excellent grip. The finish is long and supple with lingering notes hanging on the finish for 30+ seconds. An absolute steal for under $50.
",Rhone Blends
"I'm starting to get more and more used to 2010 Southern Rhones. In unbelievable vintage conditions, a serious wine like this gets kicked up a notch into totally different territory.  The aroma has a huge amount of depth. On the palate, the structure really takes over. Tannin is hitting every corner of your palate, with acid jumping around the spots in between. This is a proper wine. A tightly coiled spring, packed with flavor that will go, and go, and go. An great example of what is capable in the Southern Rhone with ideal growing conditions. A total powerhouse of a wine that is sure to impress seasoned drinkers.
",Rhone Blends
"A solid example of Gigondas, with notes of cloves, licorice, lilacs and berry fruit, this has some rustic tannins and a fuller body.  This can pair lovely with pork shanks and steak alike.
",Rhone Blends
"Like an artist applying thin washes of color to build depth and complexity into a painting, a seasoned winemaker scents, tastes and blends to achieve a desired play of aromas, flavors and textures that will contribute both to a wine's immediate enjoyment and long term pleasure. Arriving in pristine condition from a near perfect vintage, the 2005 Baron Louis expresses all the character of a great Chateauneuf without the high price— complex layers of blackberry, cassis, aged fruitcake, mocha and tobacco leaf interplay upon the palate, striking a well-wrought balance between power and finesse, panache and precision. A classic Southern Rhone red to relish and enjoy at its peak of performance!
",Rhone Blends
"I love it when a producer does the aging for me! This 2005 Baron Louis from Chateau De Montfaucon has a lovely, developed bouquet of cool black fruit and seamless texture that only comes with the passage of time. The wine still has plenty of size and life, and would be great with your next tri-tip grill up!

"Southern Rhone wines (outside of CdP wines) are always a great value when it comes to a week-night dinner; maybe for Wednesday night when I only have time to grab a whole roasted chicken from Safeway. For just a few dollars more than the average $10-15 range of bargain bottles there is the ""Baron Louis."" It is more than just the typical Grenache-Syrah blend, regardless of what the description says. It actually has 40% grenache with almost equal parts syrah, carignan, cinsault, mourvedre and counoise. It has finesse, complexity, grace and style. That's not true for most of it's fellow colleagues. It is a true standout dating back to last winter when they actually let me pour the Rhone tasting at Redwood City. Everyone who attended thought this bottle was the best-valued Rhone wine we had. Now we have it again, thank heavens.
",Rhone Blends
"This wine comes from the small family team of Girauds: Pierre (the patriarch), Marie (daughter and winemaker) and Francois (brother and viticulturist), along with the help of famed wine consultant Philippe Cambie. This wine is elegant, with gorgeous dark berry fruit flavors, exotic spice and floral notes, and fine tannins. With a long, lush finish, this is a great introduction to Domaine Giraud.
",Rhone Blends
"Giraud shows the riper side of Chateauneuf du Pape.  Plush polished fruit with notes of Chambord and cherry compote.  Rounded out with light herbal/garrigue tones.  This is a lot of wine for those seeking the richer side of CDP.  Decadent yet satisfying.
",Rhone Blends
"The 2015 Marcoux Chateauneuf-du-Pape was my favorite of the season, and I was super excited to see the Cotes-du-Rhone arrive in the warehouse. It’s good. I mean, really, really good. As you creep out of $10-15 Cotes-du-Rhones into the $15-25 price point, you tend to see these wines just push harder on bigger, fatter, and richer. The Marcoux takes a defiant stance. It shows lifted and elegant red fruits with agile acid and exceptional balance. With gentle weight, but exceptional intensity, this wine has wonderful character, is expertly executed, and a total standout in the Cotes-du-Rhone category.
",Rhone Blends
"If you're a fan of Marcoux then you are definitely in for a treat with the 2016 Marcoux Cotes du Rhone. This wine starts off with an intoxicating nose of red licorice and candied red raspberries and then deftly pivots to fresh flower and earth notes. There's a distinctly Burgundian feel here with high-toned red fruits, remarkable balance and harmony and an elegance rarely found in a Cotes du Rhone. The wine finish with impressive purity and freshness and it lingers ever so slightly on the delightful finish. This is a must buy for any wine lover who is a fan of Grenache done the right way.
",Rhone Blends
"Domaine De Marcoux is slowly turning into one of my favorite Southern Rhone producers, and their 2016 Cotes Du Rhone is an outstanding Southern Rhone blend. Mildly zesty, and subtle flavors of strawberry twizzlers on the palate, this wine delivers a good mouthfeel, mild tannins, and great structure. Dinner party wine for sure.
",Rhone Blends
"Marcoux was my winery of the year last year for their incredible Chateauneuf releases.  The 2015s  were expressive, classic and layered with so much potential that they will surely deliver the goods over the next two decades.   The 2016 vintage is as equally impressive (and maybe ultimately longer living).  The wines show a level of depth that goes beyond simple hedonism.  The basic or entry level wines from producers like Marcoux are always the great bellwether for exciting vintages because when the starter wines show this great, you know the high-end stuff will be legendary.  Marcoux's Cotes du Rhone is from dedicated vineyards following all the same bio-dynamic principals they use for the Chateauneuf, so it is no mere declassified or second wine.  This is serious Cotes du Rhone that ages beautifully but is also out of the gate charming.  Lush strawberry, dried tobacco and potpourri permeate the glass and sweet fruit persists on the palate.  So before the hype begins, drink this wine and be ahead of the curve and know what we know...2016 is great from top to bottom and Marcoux is on track to be my Winery of the Year two years running.
",Rhone Blends
"The new vintage of a classic producer's Old Vine bottling is a vibrant example of Chateauneuf-du_Pape that is at once traditionally structured, and more modern in its plush, fruit-forward character. This is surprisingly open-knit right now; brambly red and black raspberries coat the palate with the help of some chewy but surprisingly sweet tannins. Melted licorice, roasted herbs, and warm spices round out the robust palate, finishing long and rich. Pair with all things slow-cooked or pepper-crusted.
",Rhone Blends
"The Clos Saint Jean Chateanueuf is not for the faint of heart. This wine has power and persistence. It is quite young and would cellar well, but is also surprisingly expressive in its youth. Aromas of  blueberry compote, rhubarb, lavender, and clove pop from the glass. Flavors of blackberry jam, star anise, and cassis are surrounded by structure, and power.  Enjoy with a hearty oxtail stew!
",Rhone Blends
"As far as vintages go, 2014 has not garnered much attention from the critics other than it sits in the shadow of 2015.  What has been said, is that you should buy selectively and that the wines have lots of charm that makes them more accessible in the short term.   That brings us to the Clos Saint Jean Vieilles Vignes. Every year, even in the tough ones, this wine is a performer.  Though not stridently difficult, winemaker Phillipe Cambie opted not to produce the icon wines, Deus Ex Machina and Combe des Fous choosing to use the fruit to bolster the VV.  A smart move indeed because it makes for one of the best and most approachable wines of the vintage.  The nose is a panoply of rich fruit with layers of Maraska cherries and blackberry compote.  Carmelized figs, potpourri and brushy garrigue round out the nose.  Loads of classic terroir flavors will continue to evolve if given a little time.  It is long, creamy and supple.  It is more than one could hope for in this quietly charming vintage.  Oh and one more thing.  We have a throwback price on this wine!  Usually floating closer to the $50 mark, we're just below $40 making this yet another reason to stock up on a few of these beauties to enjoy now or over the next 10 years.
",Rhone Blends
"Admittedly, my notes from barrel tasting were a tad ridiculous but still appropriate - ""let's talk about fresh baby, let's talk about CDP.""  From 100% Grenache, this is where the rubber meets the road when we say fresh fruited styles.  Such vibrant quality, it is loaded with so much flavor and could be one of the great sleepers of the vintage.
",Rhone Blends
"This is exactly the type of deal that makes the Rhone one of the best wine value regions in the world.  Winemaker Didier Negron uses handpicked fruit from sustainably farmed, 50-year-old vines, aged 6 months in stainless steel for this pure expression of Cotes du Rhone.  Rich blackberry fruit, garrigue and herbs have wonderful mid palate weight and just enough acidity to give this easy-drinker lift and freshness.  Stellar value for the money.
",Rhone Blends
"I’m always looking for killer values that deliver big on power, and are reasonable enough to not give a second thought taking home at the end of the night. Enter the Rhone by Sabon. Intense and concentrated with tons of dark fruit and spice notes, I was shocked by how good the wine was at this price. I would drink this any day of the week. For those of you who love those classic power reds like the Closerie Pic-Saint-Loup or the L’Ostal Cazes, this is a must-check-out wine that’s rich, bold, and absolutely delivers.
",Rhone Blends
"I was not prepared for how good this wine was for only $11.99. Wow! If you want a little insight into how fantastic the upcoming 2016 Rhone vintage is going to be just pick up a bottle of the 2016 Rhone by Roger Sabon. Loaded with a bevy of dark berry fruit and spice notes this complex, layered beauty boasts a silky-smooth palate that displays remarkable persistence and length. This is easily one of the better wine values I have tasted this year.
",Rhone Blends
"While we do have a rather vast selection of fantastically affordable Cotes Du Rhone in the store, the Rhone by Roger Sabon is clearly one of the best bangs for your buck and easily one of my new favorite every day values. It's rustic, and slightly fruit forward, however it's never overbearingly so. Well balanced, and packed with flavors of plum, boysenberry, and some nice earthiness, this heavy blend of Grenache with slight touches of Syrah and Cinsault is definitely a crowd pleaser.
",Rhone Blends
"Sabon was one of our break out stars for our 2015 Chateauneuf campaign and 2016 looks to be equally great.  How do we know?  Taste this 2016 Cotes du Rhone-esque bottling from them.  For $12, you get a fleshy rich and ultimately very satisfying wine that delivers layers of delicious Rhone pleasure.  With the quality of 2016 showing through this humble little wine, there is no need to wait months for the CDPs.  You can enjoy this gem right now.
",Rhone Blends
"A superstar at our recent Saturday Rhone tasting, where it more than held court with wines double in price. No surprise really, as this bottle of Marcoux was cultivated and raised under the careful tutelage of Sophie Armenier and her sister Catherine, whose family roots, as one of the first inhabitants in Chateauneuf, extend back to the 10th century. Aged for the most part in concrete, with a specific regimen of small oak barrels for the Syrah and Mourvedre, this cuvee mirrors the innate quality of the 2015 Rhone vintage, with gorgeous aromatics and a mélange of alluring red fruits, floral elements, suave spice, and refined tannins…more than the sum of its parts, and a true classic in the making.
",Rhone Blends
"This was a standout wine for me at our last Rhone staff tasting. The concrete aging contributes a lovely mineral element that's well integrated with the bold fruit, herb and dried flowers. The balance of this wine is impeccable, and with some time in the cellar, I know this will get even better.
",Rhone Blends
"Lovely red fruit, fragrant flowers, and just a beauty to drink. Although this has an age-worthy presence about it, it's wonderful right now. I can't think of a better CdP anywhere near this price range that I would want to take home. A great value!
",Rhone Blends
"The CDP earned an easy ""A"" on my tasting score sheet: classic profile and perfect structure. Although still relatively young, all of the elements (fruit flavors and aromas, tannin, alcohol, and acid) are super well blended and integrated. Classic CDP spiciness, soft and approachable tannins, and great depth to the core fruit flavors all contribute to how much the entire staff loved this bottle. And the price; that's a bonus. Stock up on these for the fall/winter!
",Rhone Blends
"Absolutely lovely. I enjoyed its brooding berry fruit, herbs and smoke, displayed with elegant restraint and finesse. This should appeal to enthusiasts of both old school and modern style CDP.
",Rhone Blends
"Totally unique. Exceptionally elegant. Beautifully perfumed. These were the impressions of the staff when we tasted the Marcoux CdP at our last Southern Rhone tasting. Never overly dark, but packed with soaring red fruit, aromas of lavender, and layers of strawberry and cherry notes. This is a Chateauneuf that moves towards a slightly lighter style and executes it with stunning success.
",Rhone Blends
"Marcoux ranks as one of my top Chateauneuf producers.  The sisters, Armenier have been great stewards of the land being one of the first biodynamically certified estates in the appellation.  Under the watchful eye of winemaker Sophie Armenier, comes one of the great appellation wines of this vintage to my mind.  I first tasted this wine, with Sophie in 2016, when it was still in its component parts.  It was a scribble of notes describing a range of strawberries, spices, minerals,lavender and swirling dust. Now fully assembled, the wine is redolentof strawberry preserves, potpourri and minerals. It is long and full offinesse, and a couple of years in the cellar will be well rewarded.
",Rhone Blends
"Sophie remains a strong advocate for her native Carignan grape, believing that if properly cultivated and kept to low yields it can make extraordinary wines. And the evidence is there, for year after year her Carignan-based wines engage with their superb fruit, delineation and charm. The 2015 Clos de l’Anhel Les Dimanches, her “Sunday wine,” is fashioned from a precious parcel of 80-year-old Carignan vines blended with Syrah and Grenache. Almost opaque in color, with devastating black fruit aromas and enchanting overtones of ripe cherry, plum, cocoa and spice, balanced by a solid core of velvety tannins, this is a lavish wine that will merit a few more years in the cellar.
",Rhone Blends
"I brought this home on a whim recently and loved it.  From one of the finest female wine makers in Corbières, Sophie Guiraudon, this Carignan, Syrah, Grenache blend is aromatic, plush and incredibly delicious.  The three varietals intermingle to create wonderful complexity.  Rich, ripe blackberry, wild blueberry and cassis blend with anisette and violets.  Incredibly food friendly thanks to the Carignan heavy assemblage, this would fit right in with everything from beef to poultry to heartier vegetable dishes like lentil stew or eggplant parmigiana.
",Rhone Blends
"Strawberry, watermelon, juicy red berries. Medium plus acidity and rich fruit. A classic Provencal rose for spring!
",Rhone Blends
"Their all-estate bottling is the certified organic 2016 Château Les Valentines Côtes de Provence Rosé. A more serious rosé, this will develop beautifully over the season, showing notes of white cherries, wet stones and fresh thyme. It is the consummate Provence rosé that will pair beautifully with grilled fish. For fans of Domaines Ott (Ott’s Clos Mireille property happens to be just down the road) this is a great crossover.
",Rhone Blends
"The Réserve shows much more of the mineral qualities ofChâteauneuf, with savory black fruit and graphite. Aged primarily infoudre and larger oak tanks, this should evolve gracefully to unleashmore of the exotic floral and dusty spice notes. From the La Crau andLa Grenade lieux-dits.
",Rhone Blends
"Generous and ripe fruit but maintains balance.  This is not too showy and has great structure.  Should age gracefully into something even more special.
",Rhone Blends
"Never shy on the fruit side, the 2015 shows remarkable restraint, pushing more towards a beautifully balanced style.  Fruit is still quite present but it is of the freshest variety, the ripest you find at your local farmer's market but not pushing sur-maturity.  Harmonious tannins on the finish make this appealing now but great for short term cellaring.
",Rhone Blends
"Tucked into a small hillside to protect its vines, the village of Séguret is situated between the more recognized villages of Rasteau to the north and Gigondas to the south. The wines of Séguret may be less powerful than those of its neighbors, but they possess both freshness and structure. The 2015 Domaine Viticole “Malmont” is an excellent example of this high-value village, which offers exceptional quality in vintages like 2015. The Séguret is a blend of 55% Grenache and 45% Syrah. This wine has aromas of violets and peppery notes, with dark cherries and blackberries on the palate, all while maintaining vibrant acidity and impeccable balance.
",Rhone Blends
"A more classically rustic yet charming style. Notes of red and blackfruit macerated together with a beautiful sandalwood edge. One of thegreat values of the vintage.
",Rhone Blends
"If you are looking for a powerful wine that is not too dense or fleshy, this is a great buy. Of course the wine is big, coming from the Barossa, but at the same time it is very well balanced, showing plenty of red fruit (particularly plum) and a pleasant structure that is neither too abrasive nor too flimsy. Very well-made. It could certainly age, though I personally love how it is showing now.
",Rhone Blends
"Our good friend Nicole Rolet has surpassed herself with a new rendition of her unforgettable Rosé. A sophisticated blend of Grenache, Syrah, Mourvèdre and Rolle, this wine succeeds as a pure evocation of captivating fruit and floral elements, generous proof that Rosé can possess both finesse and gravitas. Superb!
",Rhone Blends
"This wine is in croix belle! In all seriousness, this Syrah dominated Languedoc blend, which also includes a lovely floral Grenache component, is a heady wine. Tart and Jammy black and red fruit aromas swirl from the glass in a waft of baking spices, while the palate is full  and rich, with a lighter tannin structure than you might expect from a Syrah dominated blend. There is no skimping on fruit here, with a powerful raspberry, blackberry and dried currant component. A savory/sweet note that is almost like honey dances through the suspension. This is a beautiful companion to stews and braised beef dishes, with the necessary structure and lift to cut the fat, but with the aromatics to enliven an otherwise simple dish.

"This is far and away the best domestic rosé I've tasted this year, and the most nuanced domestic rosé I may have tasted--ever. I'm a Provence fan when it comes to pink wine because I like crisp, clean acidity and just the slightest touch of red fruit. If I'm going to spend more than 20 bucks on something I'll likely drink within 20 minutes, then it had better ""wow"" me, and that's exactly what the Blushing Bear did when I first tasted it. Kyle meant for it to be a Domaine Tempier substitute and that's exactly what he created, albeit by way of Washington's Columbia Valley. Gentle accents of red berries and notes of brush lightly dance across the palate here with an enticing balanced of weight and acidity. Have this with a piece of grilled salmon and treat it like a main course wine rather than a refreshing aperitif. It's worthy of the spotlight.

"In California, there's a bit of variety fever going on. Hip winemakers continue making more and more obscure varieties, searching for something different and exciting. Recently, I've been hearing a lot of buzz about Alicante Bouschet--a variety traditionally blended into wine for color and tannin. Typically, you can only get these if you're on the wineries mailing list or in a few select restaurants. But for those of use who are still interested in these unique wines I'm really excited to have this Alicante Bouschet from French producer Viranel. It's hyper-dark, full of smoky plum tones and earthiness. I expected it to be darker, but in fact was agile and energetic--inherently drinkable, and exceptionally tasty. And where those hip California Alicantes will set you back $40, the price on Viranel makes it a no-brainer.
",Rhone Blends
"Viranel has become one of our favorite producers from Saint-Chinian.  This wine falls just outside of the appellation's rules because it is 100% Alicante Bouschet.  For those not familiar, this is grape that was often used to bump up the density and color of many Rhone styled blends, much like Petit Verdot does for Bordeaux blends.  This Alicante is old vine fruit though and stands well on its own.  It is dark and dense but shows rich black fruit tones and white peppery spice.  Full-bodied, packed with ""Sauvage"" aromas and layered with garrigue tones, this is ideal for a big plate of charcuterie or a well-marbled steak.
",Rhone Blends
"This is ripe and earthy with lots of brambly dark fruit and an array of Christmas spices on the finish (ie. clove, allspice, etc...).  For those of you who have never tried 100% Alicante Bouschet, this is a great introduction.

"My pick for best value in Languedoc-Roussillon. Hands down. The blend is 50% Grenache, 30% Syrah, 20% Cinsault, and 10% Carignan. It's built with a little more Grenache than the Bleu Velours, but absolutely outperforms its price point. The nose is full of smoky and gamy notes. The palate is all black cherry, with really sumptuous fruit and charming rustic tannins. Totally unique and one of the wines I recommend most for those looking to explore the Languedoc.
",Rhone Blends
"39% Grenache / 35% Syrah / 16% Counoise / 10% MourvedreRipe raspberry and bing cherry fruits, with white pepper, smoked meat, and wild game notes with some serious grip on the finish. There is a freshness and lift to this wine that gives a focus and precision that kept our attention. Seriously tasty release of Tablas this vintage!
",Rhone Blends
"Attention fruit lovers! This is a deliciously bold, ripe and jammy GSM blend that will delight your summer picnic palate. Brimming over with ripe strawberry, stewed black cherry, the wine offers a full, rich mouthfeel with a refreshing yet balanced acidity. With heady aromatics of fresh rose petal and violet are tempered by a spicy black pepper finish, this is a great Californian value.
",Rhone Blends
"The “Prestige” is actually a single plot co-planted with their oldestGrenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre vines plus a handful of the oldheirloom grapes from the region. The smallest production cuvée, itrapidly approaches “next level” with its incense, brambly fruit anddynamic palate. This represents high-order, terroir-driven CdP and ata comparatively reasonable price.
",Rhone Blends
"What a pleasant surprise this wine is! Nectarine and orange marmalade nose. Starts off a little fat on the palate and finishes clean with bright nectarine and juicy watermelon fruit. A super solid rose that is lush, yet clean.
",Rhone Blends
"Their benchmark wine to be sure is the 2015 Ipso Facto. A blend of the best lots from all three soils—alluvial, black schist and brown schist—the depth on this wine is almost inconceivable. Approaching perfection, this wine moves the needle on what we think about wines from the Roussillon. With organic principles, insightful winemaking and passion for their project, Château de L’Ou has done something truly amazing by changing the perception of what a region is and what can be accomplished there.
",Rhone Blends
"The Ipso Facto is a blend of Syrah coming from three different soil types on the estate of Chateau de L'Ou and a damn fine expression of what it's capable of producing. The tannins are slightly grippy but not overbearing. The nose is surprisingly beautifully executed with subtle notes of vanilla, and raspberry licorice. This bottle of Syrah is definitely a bottle you got to have a nice meal with, and not just a simple New York cut of steak. Throw some filet mignon  on the grill, and enjoy with the Ipso Facto.
",Rhone Blends
"OK wine geeks--here we go. This Viranel is 1/3 Syrah, 1/3 Cabernet Franc and 1/3 old vine Alicante Bouschet planted in 1939. This is a totally unique blend that I doubt exists anywhere else on earth... and it's only $10... and it's actually really good, too. There's spice, dark cherry liqueur, and a touch sweet fruit. Acid is there right off the get-go, and the tannins are soft and easy on the palate. This is an epic take-it-home-for-dinner-tonight bottle that's totally unique and really delicious.

"Flowery aromas give way to flavors of dark plum and spicecake.  this is ripe, lively and sweet with a fresh smooth texture and a dark and fruity finish.

"I poured this wine at a customer tasting event recently, and boy was it a hit!  A blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Grenache. A medium-bodied, rich wine that has a beautiful velvety texture. Loads of blackberry fruit and tobacco are complemented nicely with hints of bacon fat, olives and herbs. This bottle is a killer example of Santa Maria Valley wine.
",Rhone Blends
"When conditions are spot-on, Sophie makes an extraordinary single-variety wine, and the 2015 Clos de l’Anhel “Envie” truly lives up to its name. Made from selected Grenache fruit, it shimmers in the glass like a handful of rubies, and captures all the spirit, exuberant spice and generous red-fruited character of that effusive grape.
",Rhone Blends
"This is proper French wine. The nose has gamey and savory elements with floral nuances. The palate leans towards richness with  dark fruits and blue fruit with tons of spice. Intriguing as well as inviting, It definitely hits that spot between Cotes-du-Rhone and Chateauneuf-du-Pape. It's soft and supple, but still has plenty of intriguing elements that keep you going back to your glass again and again.
",Rhone Blends
"Gorgeous blackberry notes mingle seamlessly with spice and scorched earth nuances. The palate is dark berry, minced meat pie, black pepper and dried herbs. A serious wine that slowly unfurls to reveal the depths of complexity and layers of dark fruit this is a big red that showcases the power and richness that are the hallmarks of the 2015 Rhone vintage.
",Rhone Blends
"You hear of Lirac producers making Chateauneuf-du-Pape but not so much about Chateauneuf producers picking up Lirac properties...until now!  Marcoux recognized the quality of the vineyards and potential and with their bio-dynamic sensibilities found some incredible plots across the river in Lirac and are now making this exciting red.  Full of smoky rustic flavors, this is old-school with peppery spice and saddle leather wrapped around blackcurrant and roasted plum fruit.  The perfect foil for some cowboy chili or braised pork belly.

"What does greatness cost? In the Rhône it costs $159.99 a bottle. If you want a truly magical experience you can’t go wrong with Clos des Papes; this wine hits on all cylinders.

"This is one of the most overachieving, surprising, delicious and delightful wines in the store. The Halcon comes from a site far North and the fruit is simply fantastic. Bright, peppery, crunchy red berries burst on the palate. It's far and away the best Rhone style wine I've ever tasted from California. It smokes anything from the central coast.
",Rhone Blends
"One of the most truly delicious wines I’ve tasted in 2013 is the 2011 Halcón “Esquisto” Yorkville Highlands Rhône Blend ($25.99). Halcón was one of the revelations of 2012; they shocked me early on with their outrageously good Syrah and this new release did nothing but fortify that burgeoning reputation. Their estate vineyard is planted in the Mendocino County appellation called Yorkville Highlands. The vineyard sits at 2,500 feet in elevation, above the fog line, on fractured shale, quartz-rich rock and mica-schist, which is a very similar soil composition to the famous Côte-Rôtie appellation in the northern Rhône. People like Wells Guthrie at Copain have already taken notice of the relatively young vineyard and are bottling vineyard-designated Syrah from there. This estate blend of 40% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 30% Mourvèdre is wild, nervy and full of flavor, with tremendous aromatics of pithy raspberry, dried strawberry and a slight touch of cured meats. Weightless and full of energy, this is perfect for lighter meat dishes with its flavors of fennel pollen, lamb jus, black raspberry and a streak of white pepper. Rhône lovers shouldn’t miss this bottle.
",Rhone Blends
"Very rich and concentrated nose.  The palate affirms.  This is deep and luscious with flavors of kirsch and strawberry compote.  Some oak aging adds dimension.  A few years down should deliver a pretty outstanding wine.
",Rhone Blends

"This is an incredible display of terroir and typicity for Alsacean Grand Cru Riesling.  My first note was “minerals,” brimming out of the glass followed by a subtle and nuanced wave of pears, stone fruit, honeysuckle and white floral notes.  The phenolic texture is rich and weighty while the wine itself remains quite dry, with a linear, very long, mineral-laden finish.  Whether you are a long standing Alsacean Riesling fan or are perhaps looking for a wonderful new part of the wine world to discover, this is a brilliant wine at a great price point.
",Riesling
"This leads with pomelo and fresh herb notes, before detouring into a sweetly floral aspect. With plenty of cut, this slots easily in amongst our best everyday Rieslings.
",Riesling
"Fantastic value in dry Riesling! Gut Hermannsberg has always been a favorite producer for me, but this 2015 truly outshines my already rather high expectations. The nose is floral and exuberant, with notes of apple blossom, peach flower, and lime zest. On the palate the wine shows surprisingly soft white pear fruit with a long-lasting mineral backbone and refreshing acidity. Definitely one of my top picks for a dryer style Riesling under $20.00!
",Riesling
"A truly delicious Riesling that possesses a near perfect blend of juicy sweetness and crisp acidity. It is fresh and zesty and incredibly easy to drink thanks to the later harvest pick that adds character, depth, and a higher residual sugar. Andrew Hedley is the master of Riesling in New Zealand, making wines ranging from bone dry to dessert, and this sweet spot right in the middle is my absolute favorite. This is one I'd be happy to have any night of the week all year round.
",Riesling
"Oh, how I love a good off-dry Riesling! Apricot, citrus zest, and Bartlett pear, sweet but not cloying, with fabulously balanced acidity- and 8.5% alcohol. Helloooooo, summer!
",Riesling
"Framingham's ""Select"" Riesling is possibly the best wine in their production. I love this wine--it's a perfect balance and expression of Riesling that is neither too austerely acidic nor too cloyingly sweet. It is made in a ""Spatlese"" style, with slightly later harvest, and some residual sugars, yet it is still very crisp and fresh, with no botrytis influence. Rather, you have the pure fruit flavors of apricot, candied tangerine peel, and ripe honeydew in the forefront, with clean, stony mineral notes and fresh grapefruit acidity in the backdrop. Perfectly composed, and well-structured for the long-haul in terms of aging.
",Riesling
"The wines of Andre Ostertag are some of my favorite in the store and I'm always very happy when we are able to bring them in.  Ostertag has rejected the official classifications of the A.O.C. and instead created his own categories.  The Les Jardins is part of his ""vins de fruit"" wines and are made to express varietal character and the taste of the grapes themselves rather than expressing a single vineyard site and the terroir from which the grapes came.  The Les Jardins is fermented dry lending it versatility at the dining table.  They're meant to be drunk young and fresh.  I drank this over the course of two nights, each with different seafood based meals and it was fantastic.  Crisp and intensely mineral, with notes of lime/lime leaf, white flowers and under ripe nectarine, this wine is beautifully aromatic and a natural match for lighter fare.
",Riesling
"Dry Riesling for a song!  Lemon, lime a touch of green apple and a whiff of petrol.  I thought the days of inexpensive and delicious Riesling were gone, I rejoiced when I tried it!
",Riesling
"There's very little in the store that offers so much overt pleasure, complexity and versatility than this special Kabinett. The nose is just crammed full of juicy yellow fruit, strong petrol fumes, crunchy pulverized stone. The palate is vibrant, super fresh wonderfully balanced showing formidable acidity to offset any obvious sweetness. Few wines spark the appetite more readily than this little magic bean, have it with spicy thai, spetzle, or my favorite pairing with Double Double animal style.
",Riesling
"I love this wine's aromatic purity, simple, real Riesling yet with spice and vibrancy. On the palate this wine has a broad density yet excellent acidity at the same time it just makes it delicious to drink the wine finishes with just the slightest bit of sweetness but oh so refreshing.
",Riesling
"While I generally prefer my Rieslings in Trocken (dry) style, occasionally I like to try some on the sweeter side, and this Kabinett is beyond exceptional. The finish is very tropical, with hints of mango, and pineapple, this Riesling really is a treat.
",Riesling
"Over the past few weeks, I've had a few customers ask for a frizzante Riesling, not quite a fully sparkling sekt, but something with a little bit of fizz.  This is the wine that fits the bill!  It's fun, lightly fizzy and has a touch of residual sugar from the Feinherb classification that kind of reminds me a bit of a much higher acid Moscato d'Asti.  It's got ripe stone fruit, freshness and a floral quality that almost comes across as candied rose petals.  This is something I'll be picking up for a catch-up session with friends this evening, as I know it'll be a hit with everyone's varied palates.
",Riesling
"I find this wine to be quite intriguing, as it begins with a breath of white floral potpourri. The beautiful floral notes are maintained on the palate and accompanied by a rich, round mouthfeel. The richness is wonderfully lifted by balance acid that keeps the palate from getting weighed down. Throughout the glass you will find those classic dry Riesling notes and a lingering finish that keeps you going back for more.
",Riesling
"The team at Teutonic is making some of the most authentic and interesting wines in all of Oregon and this little Riesling is one of the best renditions you will find anywhere in the New World.  Beautiful concentration of stone fruit flavors, the wine has ample acidity to keep its off-dry nature on track.  But please, DO NOT think of this as a ""SWEET"" wine.  This is a wine of balance and complexity that just wants to be served with great food.  I think some Pad See Ew is calling my name and I can't wait to drink this with it.
",Riesling
"Open, spice-laden aromas give way to a lovely medium body with great acidity and freshness. The wine is perfectly balanced, with a hint of sweet stone fruit, complementing the exotic and mineral elements. I'd love to try this with a nice curry dish or perhaps some Stilton and dried fruit.
",Riesling
"Pichler is just a stellar producer and each time I taste it I realize that the glowing accolades aren't hyperbolic whatsoever. The Federspiel Riesling delivers everything you could ever want from a dry Riesling and more. A nose of incredible freshness, crushed stone, lemon oil, vibrant and piercing mineral note. Not as brooding as some, but still with a hint of petrol. Long structured and full of crunchy acidity. A world class wine from a world class name.
",Riesling
"To see the purity of the Wachau region I think Federspiel is the best vehicle, I love drinking Smaragd but that ends up being more about the grape and vintage, Federspiel is lighter and a pure insight to site. This wine's nose is archetypal Wachau, stone with hints of fusel, combined with fresh white flowers, really dramatic. On the palate it's crisp, focused, clean and showing right through to the soil, precise and direct. The finish is long, and longer, stone, mineral then branches into a bit of Riesling, excellent wine.
",Riesling
"As much as we like to triumph German Rieslings, I've had plenty of Austrian Rieslings that go toe-to-toe with just about anything coming out of the Mosel. The aromatics on this wine are a bit of a show-stealer. There are tons of white flowers and citrus bursting from the glass. On the palate, the wine comes off razor thin and super intense. The acid is off the charts here, but in a way that isn't overpowering or too extreme. An absolutely killer wine that I would happily drink anytime.
",Riesling
"This Riesling is pure in every way, yet it still has a lot of power and weight. Nice citrus finish, a nice summer wine.

"Concentrated Sangiovese fruit with layers of subtle earth and mineral scents in a soft and forward body. Wonderful to drink now! Two Thumbs up !
",Sangiovese
"Giampaolo Motta has continued his string of impressive wines with the release of his 2014 La Massa. Although the 2014 is finer in texture and tone than the recent vintages, it offers no shortage of concentration, length and acidity. Excellent to drink now but will hold well for several more years.
",Sangiovese
"Another fireball vintage from La Massa, while the 2013 was deeper and more lush, the 2014 is full bodied with bold acidity rivaling the bold wood structure from time in new french oak. Notes of fresh raspberries and cherry skins are chased by freshly grated baking spice and purple flowers. A great Toscana to try if you love those bold California cabs!
",Sangiovese
"This wine is an absolute bullseye, every single time. The level of concentration, richness and power is totally unheard of at this price range. It makes a perfect bottle to bring over to a friends for dinner, or as an everyday house red--either way its going to impress. I found it to be beautifully aromatic, with flavors of black pepper, cherries, dark fruits and dry herbs. Totally polished, sleek and effortlessly smooth, there is plenty of acidity, making it an exceptional pairing wine, and it is also jam-packed with fruit flavors, resulting in a wine that is undeniably delicious.
",Sangiovese
"La Massa is a K&L ""staple"". Year after year we've found this wine to be extremely versatile, friendly, and appealing to many palates. With all the earthy/savory elements of Sangiovese and the power and richness of Cabernet and Merlot, this super tuscan has much to offer. The 2014 is no different, and at this price, you really can't go wrong. Although the wine has all the right components now, I would recommend holding onto it for another year or so to reach its peak drinking window.
",Sangiovese
"You can really tell the breeding in this wine, the aromatics and flavors are so well defined and focused. The wine is a base of Sangiovese about 60% then Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Alicante make of the rest. The nose says Tuscany, wisps of leather, hints of violet the a bit of wild cherry show off the Sangiovese then the plumy richness of the Cab and Merlot squeeze in. On the palate the wine shows its richly textured body, supple mouth-feel and great drinkability while still showing that central focus one expects in Tuscan wine.  On the palate the complex blend of fruit and earth come together with porcini, leather and wild cherry dominating accented with lilac, rosemary and a bit of that Tuscan dust. Agile and focused this wine is ready to drink but will easily age another 5 years, try it with your favorite pasta… or like me it will be a Pork Tenderloin and roasted potatoes!
",Sangiovese
"K&L is crowded with values, but this La Massa stands out. It has the supple texture to drink on its own, but also plenty of acidity for Italian cuisine. I love the mix of dark cherry fruit and authentic galestro earthiness in this modern Tuscan red. Quality like this is rare even in our fantastic Italian section at this price!
",Sangiovese
"This has a beautiful Sangiovese bouquet with plums, raspberries and savory herbal notes.  Sangiovese does great in warm vintages like 2015, and this is no exception with great acidity and tannins for ageability.  While it is drinking delicious and fresh right now, a couple years in the cellar will do no harm at all.
",Sangiovese
"The embracing nose of toasted baking spice, oak and cherry skins leads you into a balanced Chianti with loads of bright, ripe red fruits, chewy, integrated tannins and complex earth and spice. The chewy tannins blends with the savory cherry skin character and is long on the complex finish. A lot of wine for the price!
",Sangiovese
"Modern and well-balanced, with lots of floral and mineral character and ripe plum notes .This is medium-bodied, with silky tannins and a long dusty finish. A great value for a 2015  Sangiovese.
",Sangiovese
"This is bright, sweet and clean with plenty of plump Sangiovese fruit and spice rounding out the middle.  There is more complexity here than the price would suggest and the fine, ripe tannins on the finish will let this handle even rich food.

",Sangiovese
"This is a great little everyday Chianti Classico. Loaded with dark berry fruit, spice and hints of volcanic earth this little gem of a wine brought a big smile to my face. This is a classic, easy-drinking Chianti that I will reach for without hesitation any time I want a nice bottle of Chianti.
",Sangiovese
"We do so much work with the Sangiovese wines of Montalcino here at K&L (thanks to our buyer Greg's deep connections there) that I often forget about some of our best, old fashioned Chianti expressions, the backbone of Tuscany and often what are everyday Italian enthusiasts are looking for on a Wednesday night. The 2015 Gagliole is the best tasting and best priced Chianti I've found in some time, showcasing a textbook combination of fruit, acidity, and tannic structure with power and depth. There's a lot of wine here for less than twenty bucks. While you can pop and pour, I'd give the Gagliole a good hour to open up before drinking as the cherry fruit unlocks itself after time in the decanter. This is a slam dunk deal for classic Italian lovers. It's approachable, but in no way  flashy or modern. It's managed to maintain its traditional appeal.
",Sangiovese
"The nose of this wine is full of spiced plum, bright cherry and hints of violet. On the palate the classic Castellina in Chianti Sangiovese stands out with lifting acids to center the wine and enhancing the cherry while showing more earth and spice. There’s just a tiny bit of tannin to give it a sense of structure but the overall sensation is of balance and remarkably refreshing.  This is a super drinkable wine now that will drink well over the next 3-4 years and a perfect accompaniment to your favorite pasta.
",Sangiovese
"This screaming value of a Super Tuscan impresses year after year and this is the best yet.  This is bright, clean and savory with loads of sweet berries and ripe cherries and a dusting of roasted herb.  Don't be fooled by the price-this blossoms with decanting.

"Wow, what a value! A whole lot of wine for a retail price of under $10.  Cherry and strawberry aromas followed by a bouquet of orange peel, leather, and spice. Dried dark cherries, blackberries, and fresh plum on the palate. Lengthy tannins; not expecting this considering the price point. Leather notes once more and hints of porcini mushrooms. For large and small social functions alike where an Italian red wine is needed, reach for an Erik Banti Tuscan Red Blend
",Sangiovese
"Deep, brooding and intense this is a powerful wine packed in to a modest price.  Cherries and strawberries muddled with cranberry compote and dried plumb partner with baking spice and green tea to keep you thinking about this wine with every sniff.  On the first sip you see the talent is not just in the fields growing expressive grapes, but the winemaker also knows how to corral all this flavor into a balanced package.  This is certainly a bold wine but refined in its expression.  Polished tannins bring it all together and you still have money in your wallet; well done!

"The Banti Carato not only has a huge and well-deserved following but also there's always a collective sigh when a vintage sells out and the wait for the next begins. The 2015 is a stunner and we've been anxious to get it into the hands of our customers. It's richly flavored, concentrated and definitely belies its modest price. We think you'll share our enthusiasm for this outstanding red.
",Sangiovese
"Carato has been one of our best selling wines under $10 since we first brought in the 2009 vintage. This vintage is a dramatic departure from the Sangiovese dominant wines of the past this one has 40% Cabernet, 40% Merlot and only 20% Sangiovese but the results in this spectacular 2015 vintage are truly stunning. The nose is bursting with rich cassis like aromatics highlighted with bits of leather, earth and hints of violet. On the palate the wine has a luxurious richness that shows off the powerful cassis flavors, supple, mouth-filling and perfectly balanced. The finish is long, lifted and for a wine in this price point just an exceptional value, and although the wine is full-bodied it only has 13.5% abv,. Limited availability so don’t hold back buy a few cases now to hold you through the holidays!

"I love drinking this wine. It is just the kind of wine you want when you sit down with a little bread and cheese or when you open something to drink while cooking dinner. Rich and complex, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Sangiovese. Super Tuscan & Super Price !
",Sangiovese
"A very easy choice as one of my favorite Italian reds in store. Alluring aromas of dried cherry, wild berry, plum spice, and savory herbs. Quite an expansive nose. Spice re-appears on the palate, along with mineral notes. The minerality on this wine is almost dusty in expression. Dark fruit and dried rose arrive with tannins that linger on its long finish. Will drink better in 2020 onward. However, with a proper decanting, this Chianti Classico can be quite the selection for various dinners this Holiday season. All for under $50? Done

"The 2013 Felsina Rancia Chianti is even better than last year's wine, which is saying a lot. Bright, lifted notes of black cherry and stewed strawberry burst forth energetically, but are buoyed up by a rich, dark and savory core, with notes of cassis, plum, savory Italian herbs and anise. This is a wine to contemplate and appreciate, but also just as easy to drink (and share) with your holiday and family meals.
",Sangiovese
"Felsina Rancia remains one of my top Chianti picks every vintage but the 2013 is truly special. It possesses all the best characteristics of what has been described as a challenging or tricky vintage for many. Happily the Rancia is deep, compelling and brimming with captivating fruit with acidity and tannins in perfect balance. This is one of the best of the 2013s and is certainly a Sangiovese not to be missed.
",Sangiovese
"Unbelievable depth on the nose here. Tobacco, Tar, Anise. Great concentration, great intensity. Just a touch of juiciness. I thought the tannins would be more abrasive, but it really just perfect. It sits in pockets of your mouth and glow through the finish. What a dark, delicious wine.
",Sangiovese
"A step up the their Chianti Classico Riserva is the Rancia Riserva. Name after a convent on the property, it seems as the winery and parcels grow, the quality of this wine also increases. The 2013 vintage is known for laser focused Chiantis that are lean and bright. I think this pairs well with the Rancia as it i often broad with pure fruit and savory flavors. It keeps the palate long and accentuated as you enjoy the balance and structure.
",Sangiovese
"When it comes to Chianti Classico, I am unabashedly a Felsina guy. I have always found these wines to be delicious and they have resonated with me for as long as I can remember. That said, the 2013 Rancia Riserva ramps up the deliciousness and ought to not only be enjoyed now, but cellared for a while as well. Aromas of macerated cherries, a suggestion of kirsch and walnut liqueur leads to a supple, rich, generous palate. Lots of fruit, sufficient acidity, tannins for structure...all the components are well balanced for both enjoying young and over the long haul. Highly recommended.
",Sangiovese
"Felsina's Rancia Riserva is one of the wine world's true gems - it has the proven ability to age for decades, thrills the critics and collectors alike, and somehow retains a price that makes it accessible to the masses.  Nowhere is all of this more true than the simply stunning 2013.  The aromatics are intensely layered with one nuance after another coming to the forefront.  On the palate it is very pure with a core of acidity that lifts the fruit and carries a long, bright finish.  I've never had a vintage of Rancia that is so dynamic and offers so much at such an early stage and I just can't wait to see how it ages over the years.  At under $40, I don't know if anybody in today's market can challenge this kind of class and pedigree.
",Sangiovese
"Wow….I don’t often open a wine review like this but this wine just floored me. The nose is a savory combination of salted plums, porcini dust, with a concentrated cassis like fruit focus. The wine on your palate immediately says seamless power, the textural richness of the 2013 vintage is readily apparent in a supple, smooth way yet the wine says power. Tannins are sweet, polished yet show no signs of wood intrusion they just seem to reflect the vibrancy of the sun’s rays. The flavors seem sweet for a moment with signs of wild cherry and plum then a cassis like boldness but the initial burst of fruit gives way to the wine’s savory core. Wave after wave of savory complexity begins to fill your mouth, the wine is powerful, big yet it is not dense in a heavy footed way it is just saturated flavor, fruit, earth, spice and just demands your attention. The finish is like the beginning, seamless power from front to back, side to side this wine fills your mouth with a supple, muscular, smooth richness, and this wine seems to have its own dimension. You can drink this wine now, I’d decant a couple of hours ahead of time, it is so well balanced you can really enjoy it but this is a wine that is going to last for decades 30-40 years without breathing hard. I am personally going to go deep on this wine, it is one of the best Chianti Classico I’ve ever had.

"There is something charmingly special about Poggiarellino. I’ve tasted these wines back to 1997 vintage and I’ve always found these wines to be true Brunello, through and through. There’s the beautiful acid line, the cherry liqueur notes, savory undertones, and that deadringer mocha tone that only Poggiarellino has. The 2012 continues to express all these elements, with additional touches of earthiness and rustic tannins. The 2012 is totally approachable in the near term and an exceptional complement to food. Poggiarellino continues to be my favorite Brunello producer and the 2012 has only served to reaffirm the exceptional quality of this traditional producer.
",Sangiovese
"This user friendly 2012 has big and bright fruit that hit you first, black cherries cassis and ripe strawberries and then the terroir takes on the rest of this wine, giving it a long finish that lingers long on the palate. Drinks very well young and will over the next couple of years.
",Sangiovese
"We've been anxiously awaiting the arrival of this wine ever since our memorable visit to the estate in 2016. Although we loved the 2011 for it's ripe fruit and immediacy, the 2012 delivers more on all fronts. The wine's hallmark Sangiovese aromas of earthy red fruits, sandalwood and dried florals burst from the glass while rich extract of red fruit and plum abound on the palate with smooth tannins and fresh acidity that carry it to a long finish. It possesses just the right balance of ripeness and structure that's impossible to resist.
",Sangiovese
"Poggiarellino is a tiny estate, this year’s total wine production is 583 cases, yes that’s tiny and it is only by chance and spending a lot of time in Montalcino on the ground that chance meetings can happen. That’s why K&L is so unique we bring tiny gems that would be lost to the market or somewhere else at 50% more expensive. In the 2012 vintage there is a powerful statement of place and for Poggiarellino and that is manifested in the marasca cherry that wild and gamey Italian cherry that sends surreal aromatics, it's haunting, inviting, and seductive, it’s that incredibly complex aroma that you adore it in your Manhattans. On the palate you sense the ripeness of the vintage, not over-ripe but definitely with a hint of chocolate and plums it is a dense aromatically and like the vintage that richness is balanced by excellent structure underneath, this vintage shows far more complexity, layers of spice, distinct mineral components and a truly dramatic and long-lasting finish where the spice and mineral go on forever than the really drinkable 2011. In the mouth the wine is electric- it has a real, vibrant core that drives the wine the length of your palate with a lush, dense coating yet it never hesitates to be forceful and compelling. This is a wine that is capable of aging 15-20 years easily yet balanced and rich enough to drink now!Drink from 2017 to 2030
",Sangiovese
"Baccinetti Rosso di Montalcino is very likely to be one of our best values from Tuscany this year. It far exceeds its price and delivers a level of complexity and depth of fruit we don't normally find at $15. Thanks to the 2015 vintage, this wine has all of its usual irresistible features of spiced red fruits, sandalwood and forest floor yet with greater weight and concentration on the palate. It's a real sleeper pick from one of our favorite Montalcino families.
",Sangiovese
"We've gotten in another amazing vintage of Baccinetti Rosso! This small winery is one of K&L's favorites in Montalcino, and for good reason. Add to the high quality of the wine making an almost flawless growing season and vintage in 2015, and you have a recipe for excellence! The wine has generous fruit, but is well balanced by the classic structure and earthy/sandalwood notes of the region. You could certainly enjoy this wine now, but if you forget about it in your cellar for a couple of years, you won't be sorry!
",Sangiovese
"2015 was by all accounts an exceptional vintage in Montalcino. The Brunellos may very well come to rival the unprecedented 2010 vintage. The only problem is you won’t be able to find them on store shelves until 2020. However, the 2015 Rossos are in stores now, offering a delicious sneak peak at the 2015 vintage, and at a much lower price than you will eventually pay for the ’15 Brunellos. The 2015 Baccinetti ""La Saporoia"" Rosso di Montalcino offers a classic expression of the Sangiovese grape. Savory notes of leather and spice on the nose. On the palate, bright red fruits with hints of morello cherry. Excellent ripeness with good concentration. Firm, fine tannins. Direct import pricing makes this an excellent value.
",Sangiovese
"About a year ago, I made the profound decision that with this great vintage {2015} of Rossos and Brunellos coming from Montalcino I would buy in small lots {i.e., 3 to 4 bottles each} of those wines that I really liked the best due to the fact that I am sitting on over 200 cases of wine in my wine room and do not have that much space left. Welllllll, it began that way with some of early arriving Rossos and would have continued that way, until this Gem arrived from Baccinetti. Okay, I will buy six bottles of this beauty, I said to myself, before I broke down and ended up buying a case. Medium-deep ruby in color, the opulent, flashy nose is loaded with wild black cherry to forest floor to spicy anise characteristics with undertones of cedar and clove-like herbal notes. Broad and lush across the palate, this amazingly complex, deeply flavored, well-structured, yet balanced though powerful declassified Brunello is a stunning wine that shows well now, but will age easily (which I plan to do) for another ten-plus years. Rusty has told me to bring home at least another case, maybe two, of this exceptional Gem, which I think I will. A PHENOMENAL VALUE!!!  …..A K&L WINE MERCHANTS’ DIRECT IMPORT….. ***** 14.5% ABV *****
",Sangiovese
"It's back--but for how long? When K&L introduced this producer to you last year, everyone who bought a bottle came back for quantities and it sold out quickly. This 2015 will be no exception. This wine is full of ripe Sangiovese fruit, plum, spicy blackberry, and cassis with cocoa powder, coating the palate with a little Tuscan dust on the finish of this full-bodied wine that is showing great acidity and very well-balanced tannins.
",Sangiovese
"The nose of this wine is full of sandalwood, wild cherry liqueur and wild Tuscan brush that are bold statements bursting from the glass. On the palate this is a big, rich wine with a luxurious feel, fine grain tannic structure yet still has excellent balance. The finish shows a powerful structure that is enveloped in a muscular body; the long axis lifts in the finish and lengthens the wine. This is a powerful wine for the price point and perfect for grilled meats, especially Italian sausage or your favorite pasta's flavor will be emboldened by pairing with this wine's amazing depth of flavor. For the locals... this is Catzilla, you'll know what we mean when you see the label! The 2015 Rosso di Montalcino are excellent, an outstanding vintage with a real insight to the upcoming vintage for Brunello di Montalcino.
",Sangiovese
"The wine is full of ripe Sangiovese fruit, plum, spicy blackberry, and cassis with coco powder that coat the palate with a little Tuscan dust on the finish of this Full-body wine that is showing great acidity and very well balanced tannins. Think Moms best lasagna recipe or better yet, a good friend and some pecorino.
",Sangiovese
"The historic Argiano estate has undergone a good amount of renovation of late as a result of a more recent change in ownership. The new caretakers have achieved an impressive level of refinement throughout their wines and the 2015 Rosso stands out. Warm and juicy red fruit, fully ripe tannins and a delicious lingering finish make it irresistible. This showcases Sangiovese and more specifically, the outstanding 2015 vintage.
",Sangiovese
"2015 Rosso di Montalcinos are not a vintage to miss, many even say it is the ""next 2010."" So while waiting for the 2015 Brunellos to come in, the Rossos are excellent to enjoy. The dry wood, spice and crushed cherry aromas of the Argiano jump out of the glass right after pouring. The palate is flavorful and structured with powerful dense fruit flavors. While you can enjoy this wine tonight, it can also spend some quality time in your cellar as you drink them over the next few years until the Brunellos are released!
",Sangiovese
"The nose of this wine is smoky, earthy spiced with aromatic plums, but more red plums than dark plums. The body shows lushness, supple warmth, yet without being fat, it is just textured, Argiano is in the western portion of Montalcino and has sun-kissed glow to its feel. The flavors show a bit of earth, spice, leather that combine with the smoky, spiciness, the red plums come in at the end and drive those into a more singular flavor. The finish shows Sangiovese’s long, natural structure and in a great vintage like 2015 where everything lines up you can get quite the show. Balanced, complex, texturally supple with a long finish this is a really good wine that’s going to age for another 5-10 years.
",Sangiovese
"Great value wine from a celebrated producer! This Rosso manages to balance drinkability, classic favors, and complexity all at once; very savory with a gentle depth, woody spice, and just the right amount of fruit.
",Sangiovese
"Tenuta di Sesta 2015 Rosso di Montalcino (along with Baccinetti Rosso) is one of the best deals going in our Italian section.  It's as pure of an expression of Sangiovese as you're likely to come across at this price and akin to the ""gift that keeps on giving."" It's already flying off the sales floor so we don't expect the supply to last long. Simply delicious.
",Sangiovese
"This Rosso was aged for one year in 20hl Slovenian oak barrels and unites the imposing structure of Brunello with the freshness and vivacity of a young wine; classic ripe strawberries, cherry-cola, and cranberry with a hint of leather and spice on the finish. This can be drunk young, but will evolve over the next couple of years. WARNING! This is one of those wines that will make you think: how did that bottle empty itself?
",Sangiovese
"This  2012 Fontalloro is 100% Sangiovese sourced from few different  vineyards and is simply beautiful. The opulent, forward fruit that is typical of the year is present, but a firm sense of structure keeps things from going over the top. If that sounds appealing you’ll love this wine. Dark red fruit, flowers, minerals and spices come together beautifully and with 2012 structure should age very well, tough to keep your hands off this wine.
",Sangiovese
"I was first introduced to this wine in the previous vintage and was excited to get to taste it again in the 2012 vintage. It did not disappoint at all, in fact for something to drink sooner rather than later I prefer the 2012. There is still the spectacular richness and depth that I tasted in 2011, but this vintage offers up more richness, fruit, and roundness. Dark cherry and currant in the nose lead to a big supple wine with some savory herb and dusty notes. In short this is a wine that is delicious right now and deserves to be picked up and enjoyed.
",Sangiovese
"This boasts a deep ruby/purple color, lots of black cherries, raspberries, and currants with hints spice, Tuscan dust and minerals. There is a great texture on this full- bodied wine; it has a long, authoritative finish that combines power with elegance. I would drink this now and over the next couple of years.
",Sangiovese
"The Super Tuscan category is a great place to look for value these days and Felsina produces one of the finest Sangiovese based wines in the zone. Their 'Fontalloro' is a selection of high and low altitude fruit that weds the best characteristics of Sangiovese. That, coupled with the warmth of the 2011 vintage, make this exceptional to drink now or hold for a few years. It's surprisingly fresh for the vintage and brimming with ripe, flavorful and densly packed fruit. We're glad we went long on this one.
",Sangiovese
"The nose of this wine is gorgeous; it shows a bit more ripeness, more dark plum, cocoa with bits of dried flower. On the palate this wine has the richness that one would expect  from a warmer vintage like 2011 but this isn’t a wine that is over-ripe at all, it just gives it a bit more flesh and breadth and there is a silky presence on the palate. The flavors are deep, chocolaty with delicate hints of barrel spice; Fontalloro only goes in second year barrique, followed by bits of earth, leather and cigar ash.  This wine has structure, it’s just not a flaccid fruit bomb it has tannin, power and a long life ahead of it.
",Sangiovese
"Beautiful Sangiovese that remarkably can either be enjoyed now or placed in a cellar for a few years. In 2011 the ripeness of the vintage lead to beautiful easy to enjoy friendly wines that are not necessarily the ones to lay down, but the restraint and elegance shown by the Fontalloro allows this bottling to do a bit of both. Lovely red fruit with savory herb, licorice, and chocolate are matched by long tannins with plenty of acid to help give the wine structure and length. While there is a density to the wine it stills pulls off being fresh and energetic, truly a great find.
",Sangiovese
"Savory red fruit, dried herbs, mocha and leather are the hallmarks of this wine.  Great restraint and length here as well, especially considering how hot 2011 was in Tuscany.  It's a vintage that demands some selectivity, depending on what characteristics you gravitate towards.  With a few years of bottle age on it already, the wine still has plenty left in the tank.  Ten years at least in my opinion.  There is no shortage of price to value ratio here - a true drink or hold.
",Sangiovese
"Produced for nearly three decades, Fontalloro remains one of the reference-point examples of pure Sangiovese, and one of the few that you can still find for such an immensely reasonable price considering its pedigree.  On the nose it is textbook Sangiovese all the way with strawberry, licorice, and a touch of vanilla and leather.  Superb purity on the palate, it has a core of bright red cherry, red plum, and mouthwatering acidity that sustains a clean and lingering finish.  It is texturally seamless and barely showing any age at all approaching six years from the vintage.  All of these pieces culminate in a wine that will age gracefully for the next fifteen-plus years (although even as a pop-and-pour right now it is extremely dynamic and rewarding).  A superb vintage of Fontalloro.
",Sangiovese
"The tough, rainy vintage of 2014 kept vineyard caretakers busy and all their hard work paid off with this aromatic Super Tuscan. The nose lifts with fresh red fruit and wild flowers. While I can't compare to previous vintages, the 2014 is full bodied with amiable tannin structure and a bold finish. The mouthwatering acidity wasn't washed away by the rain and keeps the wine fresh on the palate. I could definitely see putting this wine down for a few years or enjoying it tonight with a flavorful dinner!
",Sangiovese
"Made of mostly Sangiovese with Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon, the nose is classic ripe cherries and strawberries and a hint of coco powder. On the palate of this full-bodied wine, you will find the fruit describe above with a touch of minerals and soft tannins, which gives this wine a very lush feel to the palate and has an incredible long finish. This wine was a HUGE hit at my last consumer tasting in S/F .
",Sangiovese
"The nose is full of a dense, savory cassis like blend of fruit and earth, coupled with hints of leather, earth and a bit of baking spice. On the palate the wine has a long, linear feel to it, it still shows good weight on the mid-palate but its linear axis is dominant. The flavors show persistence and are a complex blend of savory fruit, earth that are aligned with the super fine grain tannic structure. This wine is truly elegant but not in a flimsy, simple, light way it has depth but it shows more restraint than overt boldness. An excellent choice of Filet Mignon.
",Sangiovese
"Behold the mighty Super Tuscan! With all the earthiness of a traditional Chianti and the rich, smoky profile and dense fruit of a Cabernet, comes the Tignanello from Antinori. This wine seems to bloom on the palate, with lush tarry flavors and aromas of tobacco, black cherry and tamarind. Aged in barriques and the first of its kind, this spectacular wine is a blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc.
",Sangiovese
"This is exactly what I want in a Chianti: Bright fruit flavors driven by lively acidity, slightly grippy tannins, a hint of earth and a real affinity for food, particularly savory and salty things: anything topped with grana padano cheese, charcuterie, grilled sausages. I believe this is one of the more satisfying Chianti's we have featured in a while - molto tipico y delicioso!
",Sangiovese
"It makes me hungry just thinking about how perfectly this gorgeous Chianti will pair with food.  Serious structure well-balanced by dark berry fruit, the harmonious 2015 Casaloste is a crowd pleasing red with depth: its rich palate restrained by earthier, almost savory herbal notes, with solid tannins on the finish.  Plus it’s barely twenty bucks and it even has points – mangia!
",Sangiovese
"I hate to admit, I'm the guy who steers people away from basic Chiantis unless it's from one of my favorite producers - Rocca di Montegrossi, Fontodi or Felsina.  I'm a sucker for northern and southern Italian reds and often find mid-tier Chianti a little lacking.  You usually have to go up market to get something really special and complex.  But here is something that delivers gorgeous Chianti flavors at a price that makes it an upstart to some of the bigger boy wines from one of those other producers I mentioned.  Detailed and utterly pleasing, the Casaloste has flavors of ripe cherry, raspberry, savory spices and hints of floral fruits.  There's a touch of back bone here in the structure that says, I'm good to rest for a few years or drink me with a big plate of bolognese.  Utterly sophisticated and pleasing, I could easily see, Casaloste joining the ranks of my other favorite producers if they keep delivering wines at this quality.
",Sangiovese
"This is bold, dark and structured with earth and mineral tones streaking through the deeply fruited middle.  Traces of cocoa and oak add aromatic complexity and flavor but the ripe tannins beg for hearty food.  Bring on the chicken cacciatore or eggplant parmigiana.
",Sangiovese
"This is a lot of a Chianti for under twenty bucks!   Casaloste is a small family farm in the foothills of Tuscany, and they produce just a few thousand cases a year using entirely estate-owned, organic vines in the heart of Chianti Classico.  Think rich savory wild berries and dark cherries, notes of mocha and herbs with nuances of smoke and toast from French barrels.  It has supple, elegant tannins due to the little bit of Merlot, and great acidity from the Sangiovese for a long, focused finish.  Get me some gabagool!
",Sangiovese
"Beautiful, bold, rich expression of Sangiovese for those looking to get into a perfectly priced full-bodied Chianti. This wine gives dark fruit, leather, and some earth on the nose while giving way to red cherry, blackberry, and solid coating tannin. While there is plenty of boldness in this bottle, everything here works together to bring about a pleasing wine experience.
",Sangiovese
"The nose of this wine is perfect, the classic blend of red fruits, savory bouillon and porcini like components accented with bits of Tuscan dust. On the palate the wine is serious it’s big and powerful yet more agile and elegant than pondering, while the tannins are super fine giving it a fine, web-like structure. The wine has just enough plumpness to give you that sensual pleasure, the richness without being heavy and the wine all comes together in a long and lifted finish. Excellent quality with a long life ahead.
",Sangiovese
"I have to give our Brunello customers credit: this is always amongst our most popular Brunelli, and as consistently tasty as it is, I can see why. While Sesta tends to show rich, succulent red fruits, they are even more delectable in a forward, juicy vintage such as 2012. While there is fruit here, and lots of it, there is also sufficient acid balance and structure to see it through some mid-term cellaring. Greg (St Clair, our Italian buyer if you don't know him by now) refers to 2012 as something of a goldilocks vintage, and this wine does indeed taste just right.
",Sangiovese
"I love these user friendly Brunelli's in 2012. Impressive nose, with loads of ripe fruit, this is full-bodied with soft tannin structure, that won’t hurt your teeth. Love the fruit that is an impressive, rich and concentrated. The wine boasts excellent length, with black cherry, leather and a spicy nose with a little Tuscan dust and minerals on the finish. It is drinkable now, with a couple of hours in a decanter, or give this wine time to improve and continues to evolve for another five to ten years. I am thinking a pork roast loin.
",Sangiovese
"Sesta di Sopra is one of the jewels of our Italian department and we're ever grateful that they are part of our direct import family. This tiny estate continues their unbroken string of exceptional Brunellos with the release of their 2012. It's a substantial wine that not only expresses its calcerous soils with pleasant earthy nuances but also exudes rich, deep Sangiovese fruit with fine grained tannins and a perfect dose of acidity. It's a full-bodied red with savory dark and red fruit flavors that coat the palate and continue to a long finish. It ranks among the truly great values of the vintage and it's a Sangiovese we think you'll appreciate as much as we do.
",Sangiovese
"An absolutely delicious wine from an elegant and balanced vintage to decant tonight or lay away.  This is rich and ripe with an earthy nose of baked soil and an intense middle of ripe and savory cherry fruit in a round and approachable style.
",Sangiovese
"My colleagues discovered the wines of this producer several years ago and they have remained customer favorites since. We met up with Gaetano Salvioni in 2016 during our Italian travels and were reminded why. His 2012 Brunello hits all the right notes with wonderful savory red fruit, exotic spices and an overall freshness, depth and length not normally found at this price.
",Sangiovese
"Albatreti is a new find ( Our third vintage for you) to Greg & I and we thought that we must share this with you! You will find a lot of Tuscany in this glass that is ripe and fleshy with cocoa, spice, black fruit and density, full-bodied and broad on the palate with complex layers of earth and some good tannin structure on the finish. This is a wine that is very user friendly now and has the aging potential of 5 to 10 or more years. This is the ideal match for red meats and roasted poultry or just a BIG glass all by itself after a long day from work.
",Sangiovese
"You might have heard that the 2014 vintage was difficult in Chianti and it was, that means producers make less and sometimes declassify wines down into the less specific wines. That's this wine no San Marcellino this year but OMG this wine is outstanding, The nose is full of wild cherries and earth, bits of leather, hints of truffle, spice, it is really amazing. On the palate the wine has richness, structure, balance and shows lots of complexity. It finishes with a well balanced richness, supple and structured, and it drinks really well now. Try it with your next grilled meat.
",Sangiovese
"Here is one our most popular wines from Tuscany! The 2014 reminds me a lot of the 2004 vintage, black cherries, spicy oak, and a touch of earth. In the mouth, the wine is full-bodied, with fine concentration, with well integrated & soft tannins. Enjoy tonight (needs decanting time, an hour or so) and over the next few years.  Two BIG Thumbs up !!!
",Sangiovese
"This excellent 2012 Brunello from Frescobaldi represents a more modern approach to the category and is one of the best examples of the style. It's bigger shouldered and denser in weight than average, which translates to a concentrated palate that's smooth and polished with loads of delicious black fruit flavors. Aging in newer French oak adds a pleasant touch of well-integrated oak as well.
",Sangiovese
"The nose of this wine is plumy, riper, with hints of French oak that give the wine sweetness in the nose followed by an earthy drift that reminds you the wine is from Tuscany. On the palate the wine has a density and richness, full-bodied, shows polished tannins that add to the sleekness of the wine. The flavors are plumy, spicy and show more fruit driven character than earth. The finish is polished, long and has hints of sweet vanillin highlighting the flavors.
",Sangiovese
"The hot, dry 2012 vintage has been bringing us more full bodied, riper Brunellos that are very unique to the vintage. With the use of irrigation, Barbi was able to combat the dry heat and keep the great structure we love from Brunello- making this wine still quite ageable. If enjoying now, I would decant the wine for at least an hour. Right after opening the wine is reserved and retrained but it opens into gorgeous fresh fruit and spicy aromatics.
",Sangiovese
"Barbi has always been one of my favorite of the more classic style Brunello producers and I am especially impressed with their 2012. There's a freshness and vibrancy that shines through some very bright and savory red fruit in this medium-bodied gem. The tannins are ripe, the acidity is balanced and the wine is wonderful now and will drink nicely over the next few years.
",Sangiovese
"This wine is full-bodied wine with some tannin structure and intense fruit (black cherries and plum) and a hint of mineral flavors and was very well-crafted. I would give this a couple hours of decanting and serve with a blackened Tri tip or a pork loin fresh  off the Que.
",Sangiovese
"This wine is gorgeous, Fattoria dei Barbi is one of Montalcino’s classic wines, and for me it defines the “classic” style in Montalcino. The nose is full of a tight wild cherry, plumy swirl interspersed with leather, spice and Tuscan brush that is wildly attractive. On the palate the wine has a density, a smooth muscle power, supple, and where Barbi sometimes comes across a little gritty this vintage shows a bit of sweetness rounding off the edges. The flavors are stunning, so focused, saturated, and really show a great combination of place and vintage while being extraordinarily well balanced. The finish is long, alive and seems to lift in the back end regaling one with that ultra complex Sangiovese wild cherry spice that goes on and on. This wine is remarkably drinkable now yet will age easily up to 20 years from the vintage, I really love this wine.
",Sangiovese
"I pointed out several months ago to Greg St.Clair, our Italian wine buyer, that he was an evil person, imposing horrible buying habits on most of us, including yours truly, at K&L. What drove me to this realization is that for the first time last year, I discovered that I have more Tuscan red wine (mostly Brunello and Rosso di Montalcino) in my wine room than I do Bordeaux. And, it is all his deceitful, conniving fault. He forced me into buying these wines, and, in reality, I am really grateful that he did; I have some incredibly great wines aging in that room. Well, I am adding this classic Antinori Riserva to that collection. Medium-deep ruby in color with dense, thick legs, the nose is opulent and powerful  with red berry fruit driven characteristics, and mosswood, leathery, dusty notes with a touch of mild toastiness. Rich, broad, viscous, and distinctive in the mouth, all these qualities carry over nicely to a wine of incredible complexity, depth, and structure, yet with perfect balance. This Gem refuses to quit on its bright, lush finish. Both Rusty and I absolutely love this Riserva Gem and plan to put several cases in our wine room for future consideration. If you want to try it near-term, decant and air (of course!) for an hour or so, to give it time to really open up. A GREAT LONG-TERM VALUE!!!  …..A K&L WINE MERCHANTS’ DIRECT IMPORT….. ***** 13.5% ABV *****
",Sangiovese
"This wine is for me the embodiment of Old World elegance.  It captures the savory Sangiovese flavors of cherries, raspberries and plum with subtle notes of spices and herbs.  It has a soft earthy texture underlying rich, concentrated fruit and just a touch of acidity.  Very well balanced, structured and, in a word, elegant.
",Sangiovese
"This wine would be a wonderful introduction to the world of Chianti for anyone new to the variety or region. It is a lovely blend of red fruits and mild acidity, with soft tannins, and a lighter than expected mouthfeel. The earthy qualities are in no way overpowering in this wine, but add some structure and depth, which is perfect for someone used to drinking more fruit-forward wines. Because this Chianti is lighter bodied with cherry and raspberry notes predominant, I feel it can easily be enjoyed now with a few hours of decanting.
",Sangiovese
"Tasting this wine was a revelation for me. I had felt in past vintages that Antinori had become too big, that they had lost their way as a top Chianti producer; this wine really shows they’re back on track! The nose is so pure, classic Sangiovese aromatics of wild cherry, earth, leather and a woodsy spice fill your nose. On the palate the wine carries those same aromatics and turns them into lively flavors. As the wine warms in your mouth it builds, opens and expands the spice and leather blossom and adds a complex layer to underscore the wild cherry. This wine is really built for the future; superb balance and structure. I opened mine and decanted it a couple of hours ahead of time and it just exploded. While built for the future it is so well balanced you can drink this wine easily now, as I did with my bottle! Try it with your favorite pasta or as I did with grilled pork chops! Kudos to Antinori for getting this fabulous Chianti Classico back on track!
",Sangiovese
"It's been a while since I've tasted Chianti that balanced the softness of the wild cherry with the savory, meatier flavors this well. Everything about the Antinori Riserva's profile is harmonious and fluid in its flavor. It's equal parts old school and new school, equal parts fruit and leather, equal parts structure and suppleness. It's a complex Chianti, one that expands beyond the simple table wine elements we adore so much and blooms into a more expansive experience. I could drink this with pasta, with a steak, with pork tacos, or just on its own after a long day at work. You can cellar it, or you can decant it and enjoy it now. This is a can-do Chianti.
",Sangiovese
"Fresh cherry, dry earth and savory notes on the nose become integrated and elegant as the wine opens up in the glass. These flavors are complemented on the palate with the polished and light structure of the wine. At first, the ripe fruit is the star of the show but as time progresses the spice really begins to shine. Throughout it all, an underline of classic Sangiovese savoriness gives depth to each sip.
",Sangiovese
"After a long absence from our sales floors, the Villa Antinori Chianti Riserva is back in stock. This iconic label remains one of the benchmark wines for Antinori and we love the 2012. Made from ninety percent Sangiovese and ten percent Cabernet, it boasts a seamless palate of red and black fruit flavors with ample underlying acidity and plenty of length. It's a bit shy when first opened but fleshes out perfectly with proper aeration and there's nothing out of place. Simply delicious.
",Sangiovese
"This is simply beautiful. The opulent, forward fruit that is typical of the year is present, but a firm sense of structure keeps things from going over the top. If that sounds appealing you’ll love this wine. Dark red fruit, flowers, minerals and spices come together beautifully in this Riserva.  Buy a couple, it will keep.
",Sangiovese
"Chocolate covered blueberries, healthy loam, Dr. Pepper, and strawberries on the nose, which all come together harmoniously on the palate. Perfect tannin structure, supportive acidity, and a long and delicate finish. This is a beautifully unique Brunello that is sure to spark a conversation.
",Sangiovese
"This is a bold and vibrant Brunello that will especially appeal to those looking for Sangiovese with ample intensity and length. ""Poggiarelli"" boasts penetrating red and black fruit flavors that carry on to a lengthy finish thanks to some solid acidity. It's aged in medium-sized French barrels yet the oak is perfectly integrated allowing the fruit to shine.
",Sangiovese
"Cortonesi, née La Manella, produces this particular bottling of Brunello from a well regarded site in the Southeast corner of the denominazione. The wine is brawny, salty, savory, black fruited and built, though there is still a quality to the wine that makes you salivate and reach for another glass. I like the style, and with any meat finished with rosemary and sea salt, I imagine I would like it even more. Bravo! A fine Brunello.

"I  am Lovin on the 2012 Brunelli, beautifully layered, expressive wine bursting with sweet  ripe strawberries, black cherries intermingled with subtle earth and toasted oak notes, minerals and a hint of bitter chocolate on the on the finish, round and ripe tannins and a long aftertaste and really well sturture. Great for gifts, or the Holiday table.
",Sangiovese
"The nose is full of dark fruit, spiced blackberry, hints of baking spice, and some Tuscan brush. On the palate the wine has real depth of flavor, darker fruits, more saturated flavors then the savory portions sweep forward, wild mushroom, rosemary, coriander. The tannic structure begins to show, fine grain and in balance and supports the supple richness where more wild cherry and blackberry flavors come to the front spiced with bits of savory earth. The wine comes together in the finish showing lots of complexity, a rich mid palate and long balanced finish. I think this is the best wine this winery has made, it comes from a plot in the south eastern portion of Montalcino.
",Sangiovese
"Ardenga may not be well known here in the States but they produce terrific Brunello. Their 2012 captures the best characteristics of the vintage; lush fruit combined with excellent freshness and structure. Ardenga boasts irresistible, concentrated cherry and plum fruit that packs a mid-palate punch and a lengthy finish. Pleasant grippy tannins add another dimension to the overall appeal of this wonderful red from the hills of Montalcino.
",Sangiovese
"The nose of this wine is savory, dried wild cherries, salty plums and hints of leather. On the palate the wine expands, it has a lush, supple feel that caresses the fine grain tannin as it rolls across your tongue. The flavors are true to the nose, showing the savory ripeness, oyster shell, and the word the Italians use macchia, what they call the flavor of the wild scrub; it shows up frequently in Brunello.  The wine is supple, broad and mouth-filling in a gentle way; it shows great length and acidic structure while the tannic structure is exceptionally well integrated, while the dried cherries and dried flowers show up in the final moment of the finish.  Abbadia Ardenga may not be the Brunello producer on the tip of your tongue yet, but as their wines slowly become available in the US you’ll be glad they have finally arrived.
",Sangiovese
"The Tenuta di Sesta Brunello is one of the best, ready-to-drink values in fine reds right now! It’s showing beautiful, concentrated flavors of cranberries, raspberries and plums; orange peel and mint with a smokey savory edge and just a hint of saline.  Incredible complexity, depth and balance for what amounts to a bargain price in the world of Brunellos.
",Sangiovese
"Big wine, little price!!! Do not let the price let you think that this is a lesser wine. This is a Great 2012 Brunelli that will develop over the years. If you open this wine in the next couple of years, give at least four to five hours decanting.
",Sangiovese
"Wild cherry, plum, dried flowers, bits of spice highlight the nose that is forward, direct and persistent. On the palate a textural richness is the first thing you notice, bold, supple yet firm, the tannins are very fine grain and disappear into the background. The wine still has good acidity and freshness with a bit of lift in the finish, while the flavors show more of a savory fruitiness highlighted with bits of citrus and leather.  I’ve been tasting Castello di Romitorio’s wines for decades, and for the first time I was really surprised, their wines used to show lots of wood and that usually is a bit off putting for me, but this vintage was a revelation.
",Sangiovese
"The 2015 vintage in Italy is pretty fabulous and in Montalcino it was really good: warm, dry, sunny and then a couple of late sprinkles to give the vines a bit of water (irrigation is not allowed in Montalcino). I was in Tuscany for the harvest that year and the weather was perfect. Although I didn’t taste atCastelgiocondo, from the properties where I did taste I could tell immediately that it wasan exceptional vintage. The Castelgiocondo “Campo ai Sassi” Rosso di Montalcino (campo ai sassi means field of stones) comes from a series of vineyards planted in 1990 to 2000. The wine had 16 days of fermentation on the skins in stainless steel and then went into a mix of barrels — 80 and 100hl Slavonian oak barrels, and a sizable portion in used French oak barriques. The nose is plummy, with hints of chocolate and spice. On the palate the wine shows a supple richness backed up by some evident tannin. They suggest that you pair the Rosso di Montalcino with an egg-pasta dish such as pappardelle with a rabbit sauce, or in Montalcino the ubiquitous wild boar
",Sangiovese
"For me the wines of La Gerla always manage to showcase a purity and intensity of fruit in an elegant framework and their 2015 Rosso is certainly one of their best yet. It's a real classic aged in large casks which preserves its aromas of dried florals, sandalwood and red fruits. Additionally, this concentrated, mouthwatering Sangiovese is perfectly balanced and will drink nicely now and for several years to come. Pasta, roast pork or cheeses with this one.
",Sangiovese
"This is not only an impressive Rosso but also one of the best 2015s I've tasted. Andrea Cortonesi really captures the vintage with this complex, full-bodied Sangiovese. It's so good, in fact, that it might be mistaken for a great Brunello in a lesser vintage. The Uccelliera Rosso offers concentrated fruit and deftly integrated tannins and acidity. A truly outstanding wine.
",Sangiovese
"Another one of these awesome Rossos that's reinvigorating my interest in Montalcino. Bold savory nose of spice, slightly smokiness, and distinctly old school character without being unapproachable. This is old school in a way that almost anyone could appreciate. It very generous and lively on the palate and finishes long and quite clean considering the striking savory quality on nose. Stupendous stuff, which serious buyers should be trying to buy by the case.
",Sangiovese
"The nose of this wine is smoky, savory, umami driven and reminds me a lot of the aromas from the 2010 vintage and they were heavenly. It isn’t as if there is a lack of fruit it’s just that it’s not that ebullient California fruity forwardness. The fruit in this wine is part of that savory nose it’s just integrated, the wild cherry aromatics are less like a bowl of Jell-O they’re more like that pungent, earthy, aromatic, dried cherries can give, concentrated but not “fruity”. On the palate you sense this is Sangiovese immediately, the long axis that gives wines from Montalcino that great length and lift. There is no sense of sweetness on your tongue but you can feel the movement, that electric vibrancy driving the flavors and the supple texture. The finish is very well balanced, complex and persistent. This is a wine that is really drinkable now, but I always like to decant Sangiovese for an hour or two, it opens an expressive option. This wine will age very well, 10-15 years from the vintage opening, gaining complexity.
",Sangiovese
"Here is an easy to drink Brunello at a great price and perfect for tonight.  This is plush and rounded with gentle depth to the flavors and aromas of ripe cherry fruit, wild flowers, damp soil and tar.  The mineral laced finish is long, fruity and flavorful.
",Sangiovese
"If you are looking for a great Brunello to start drinking while you continue to age those ‘10s, the 2012 Saporoia is showing really nicely.  Flavors of ripe cola berry and plums, hints of violets, mint and black tea, with delicious savory umami and herbal notes.  I love the richness and drinkability afforded by the riper style of Baccinetti and it should age quite nicely over the next few years.
",Sangiovese
"Since so many of our customers are regularly in search of value-priced Brunellos (and we are as well!) we wanted to make mention of Baccinetti's outstanding 2012. Since tasting it over a year ago, this wine is really showing beautifully. It opens with attractive scents of forest berries, dried florals and spice and offers captivating flavors of black cherries and red fruit with ripe tannins and mild acidity that bring it all together. It's a tremendous value Brunello that we highly recommend.
",Sangiovese
"This Brunello is coming from the user friendly vintage of 2012 this ""puppy"" is good to go or I should say drink. This is full-bodied wine with silky and soft caressing tannins and intense fruit (black cherries and plum) with hint of mineral flavors and was very well-crafted. I would give this a couple hours of decanting and serve with a winter’s hearty stew.
",Sangiovese
"Antinori’s Pian delle Vigne estate is on the western edge of the Montalcino appellation west of the village of Camigliano. Pian delle Vigne’s location is in the warmer, drier, western portion of Montalcino the harvest is generally a couple weeks earlier than what it would be in Chianti Classico and all around Montalcino. In the wet, cool 2014 vintage it helped to be in a warmer drier location and the wine’s 100% Sangiovese shows a fleshier balance than many of the other 2014s. Aged in large oak casks the wine has complex character of plum, leather and spice, perfect for a plate of Pinci, the hand-rolled spaghetti-shaped pasta that you will undoubtedly have with a wild boar sauce when you are in Montalcino!
",Sangiovese
"This is definitely a big, concentrated style Brunello with moderate tannins and mild acidity, and a more modern expression as well as the wine is aged in medium-sized French barrels. It's packed with rich fruit and a touch of new French oak that adds to its overall appeal. Open this one with a juicy steak.
",Sangiovese
"The nose is full of aromatics, wild herbs, dried flowers, wild cherry, and plums with a bit of star anise and cinnamon, not a dramatic bold statement but more like a gentle breeze. Yet on the palate this is a big, bold wine with a broad, rich center that shows sweet, fine grain tannin coupled with a lower acidity that makes the tannins stand out a bit more. The finish emerges as more savory and earthy than the mid palate would predict and shows signs of the Tuscan brush, porcini, leather that all come together with wild cherry and plums in the finish.
",Sangiovese
"Armilla has definitely released what we think is their best wine to-date. Their 2012 Brunello exudes elegance and subtle texture enhanced by delicious strawberry flavors and bright acidity. There's no shortage of personality to this wine and it certainly showcases the wonderful red fruit their region of Montalcino is known for.
",Sangiovese
"I was immediately smitten with this Brunello.  Straight out the gate, it exudes old timey charm with restrained aromas of red fruits and dried mandarin peels. Flavors are also red fruited, with a light textural feel, layered, subtle flavors, and an overall airiness to the wine that makes it drink well young, though I feel like the impeccable balance at this young age may well allow for some solid mid-term cellar potential. A new name, but one that I will be sure to remember: Armilla!
",Sangiovese
"The nose is full of ripe, plumy fruit highlighted with bits of clove and wild flowers. On the palate the wine is full, rich and has a smoothness to it that is just short of lush, sort of a plus size supple, here more savory flavors emerge, porcini, leather and salty plums. The wine is really well balanced and rich tannins and acid are in perfect harmony, the best wine I’ve ever had from this estate. Armilla is located on Montalcino’s western slope near the hamlet of Tavarnelle, close to Fossacolle, Gaja, Soldera and Caprili.With just over 6 acres of vineyard, planted in 1982, they make 566 cases of Brunello a year, their first vintage was the release of the 1997 aged in 25hl Slavonian oak barrels for 30 months.
",Sangiovese
"While the nose of the DOCG Brunello is savory dominated the Filo di Seta has a nose filled with denser fruit, berry, plum a dark fruit yet while it is more fruit filled it would be wrong to think of this as a wine with a fruity nose.  Just like in the nose the flavors in this wine aren’t a “California” fruit this is a complex, less sweet version while still having a saturated density to it, it is deeper, more faceted and more reticent.  The finish shows what this wine needs, time, this is a bigger, denser version of the DOCG Brunello; the flavors are slightly more restrained and seem fresher, more precise and more focused that come together and form a long and complex vintage. A couple more years and this wine will blossom but if you opened one now I’d help you drink it.
",Sangiovese
"Flaccianello remains one of the greatest Tuscan Sangioveses and the 2012 is regal. The Manetti family reduced the yields by twenty percent and carefully selected the grapes from five of their parcels to make this stunning wine. The fruit is dark, rich and aromatic and the wine is full-bodied with deftly integrated tannins and oak and the ability to age many years. Open now with proper aeration or allow it to develop in the cellar. Outstanding.
",Sangiovese
"Big, beautiful, full and focused. This wine is a wonderful expression of Sangiovese. It begins with juicy deep fruits such as blackberry and black cherry. It has gripping tannins that are complemented by dry spice and leather. The wine does not weigh down the palate, but intrigues the senses with its long, clean finish.
",Sangiovese
"This wine is 100% Sangiovese and a small marvel of class and power, especially when the vintage is taken into account. There is wonderful richness of fruit, which melds beautifully with the aristocratic oak, giving spicy scents which come through on the palate, dark-fruit, ripe strawberries with concentrated aromas of blackberries, dark coco powder and stony minerals. Full-bodied, with soft tannins and an incredibly long finish, will age very well.
",Sangiovese
"I have always loved Flaccianello, its’ purity of fruit, the meticulous winemaking, and exceptional vineyard sourcing has made it an international sensation.  This vintage is magnificent; the nose is full of wild cherry, spice, earth and a sense of the suns warmth, not overripe but it has a glow. On the palate the first sensation is of its incredible length, long and then even longer but that doesn’t take away from the supple richness coiled around the central structure giving one a sense of richness. The tannins are sweet and long and with the wines length they give the wine a powerful structure for long term aging while still in excellent balance. The finish is full of spice box, leather and plum, rich with a sense of lengthening. A superb wine, hope fully you have a child born in this year, got married in this year or just like to drink this year!
",Sangiovese
"The wines of Lazio are fewer in number these days and far less represented in the US as more profitable crops have been planted across this breadbasket zone of Italy. One of the most important red wines of the region is Cesanese and Formiconi makes one of our favorite. Their 2013 reminds somewhat of Montepulciano yet the nose is more fragrant with lifted notes of roses, violets, dark cherry and earth. What makes this especially good is a medium-to-full-bodied palate of soft, flavor-packed dark fruit with ripe tannins and a very smooth finish. This unique Italian red is definitely worth seeking out.
",Sangiovese
"The nose is full of fresh strawberry with hints of spice that waft from the glass. While on the palate the first thing one notices is the focus, that crisp acidic center all rose needs and balances out the fresh fruit character. Balanced, refreshing and so flavorful, everything you need in a Rosato!
",Sangiovese
"Love these user friendly 2012 Brunelli, This is very concentrated and has a  impressive nose for the vintage, with loads of ripe fruit, Full-bodied and very velvety, with beautiful soft  tannins and great fruit, full-bodied, this wine boasts excellent length.
",Sangiovese
"This wine comes from the northeastern quadrant of Montalcino near the town of Torrenieri, here the soils are denser and have more clay which give wines of richness and breadth. The nose of this wine is bold, lots of sweet plumy fruit with a bit of tomato leaf. On the palate the wine is rich, dense and full bodied showing wild plums and earth while accented by hints of vanilla. The finish pulls it all together and bits of wild mushroom and saddle leather emerge to couple with the deep fruit. This is a fairly new winery the vineyards were planted in 1998 and sold until Maddalena Cordella took over and released her first wine with the 2010 vintage.The wines are aged for 24 months in 25hl Slavonian oak
",Sangiovese
"The aromatics in this wine speak more to its density, level of saturation and structure, like I’ve never experienced in this level of Banfi Brunello before. Plum, cherry, savory meats, spice blended with dried flowers highlight the nose. On the palate it is the wines structure that takes over, big, shoulder size tannins that give a framework of power and allow the dense fruit to bond. Flavors of plum and cherry are mere accents to the dense power. Very fine grain tannins pull the wine to a long and vibrant finish.
",Sangiovese
"This boasts a deep ruby/purple color in addition to sweet vanilla (from French oak), and lots of black cherries, raspberries, and currants with hints spice, Tuscan dust and minerals. There is a great texture on this full- bodied wine; it has a long, authoritative finish that combines power with elegance. So… pull the cork a few hours before you throw pork roast on the Q’ and enjoy the first days of spring.
",Sangiovese
"I do believe I can still sense the finish on the 2012 Baricci Brunello after tasting it in Italy.  For those who were fortunate enough to try the earlier vintages, you'll immediately recognize the style and be blown away by the lovely power, complexity and length of the 2012.  Baricci is certainly continuing their history of offering absolutely spectacular Brunelli from Montosoli at amazingly affordable pricing.
",Sangiovese
"Classic “Montosoli” nose with lots of terroir (Montalcino dust and lots of minerals).spice, cinnamon, cardamom and anise with a touch of leather and brings that to the palate as well. This will need at least a half a day of decanting and will drink over the next couple of years.
",Sangiovese
"Baricci’s 2012 is a magnificent wine and a first-rate follow up to the now legendary 2010 vintage. The nose is classic Baricci full of wild black cherry, cinnamon, anise, cardamom and leather with a bit of what I call sweet earth. Its superb southeasterly position on the Montosoli hill allows its character to shine through without being overly extracted and leaves it with that hint of earthy complexity. On the palate there is real focus, the wine is long, layers of complexity wrapped around its central core, with a vibrant palate presence and still while chocked full of complex flavors the wine is supple, lithe and smooth. This wine packs plenty of muscle but it’s not bulky muscle it’s power is long, elegant and graceful. The finish is….well it doesn’t finish it just seems to go on and on effortlessly. We sometimes think that aging ability is built on some massive structure but it’s not it is truly about balance and Baricci is one of Montalcino’s best expressions of complexity and balance. We here at K&L have been drinking Baricci Brunello for a long time, this is our 15th vintage and you can ask most of the staff members who were smart enough to buy earlier vintages the age sensationally. One of Brunello di Montalcino’s founding members, there were only 28 to start, this is a wine not to be missed!
",Sangiovese
"This boasts a deep ruby/purple color, lots of black cherries, raspberries, and currants with hints spice, Tuscan dust and minerals. There is a great texture on this full- bodied wine; it has a long, authoritative finish that combines power with elegance. I would drink this over the next couple of years.
",Sangiovese
"The nose is deep, concentrated, brooding it almost seems to keep you in the dark then swirls of smoke, plum, leather come towards you. On the palate this wine is powerful, it isn’t a giant tannic monster it is just dense, rich yet remarkably well balanced for the power it has. The flavors are ripe, black licorice, sweet plum and then a spice parade of clove, truffle, wild herbs and leather. The finish is in balance, there are powerful tannins but they aren’t bitter, just evident and housed in richness, and impressive wine. I love Capanna, but when you like Capanna you have to like big, structured, dense Brunello and then yearly you get to try theirs and it regardless of vintage stays true to form.
",Sangiovese
"The nose is classic wild cherry with bits of leather and hints of vanilla. On the palate the wine shows depth and richness while more savory flavors take over, salted plums, porcini and a bit of cherry. A very long finish, well balanced where the savory components still show their presence.  This winery has changed its name from La Mannella to the family name of Cortonesi, it has been a generational change as son takes over for father. The winery is located in the on the Versante Senese, the slope under the town of Montalcino facing Siena.
",Sangiovese
"You can really sense the richness of this wine that is dictated by Talenti’s Western Slope location, the wine smells of the afternoon sun. The nose is full of an umami spiked plum, far more savory than fruity yet the nose still has a dense fruitiness to it, it fills your nose almost like the difference between warm summer breezes that fills your sinuses in New Orleans versus a similar afternoon in Phoenix, there is a lushness to it that feels like humidity rich environments. On the palate the wine is agile, linear, while still reflecting that density that is ubiquitous yet it remains remarkably elegant and fresh on the palate. The flavors amble between those salty plum and dried wild cherry flavors with suggestions of Mediterranean garrigue. The finish has a certain lushness about it, but not overtly fat at all just a bit of weight on its bones that gives it more drinkability now. It still has the classic Sangiovese linear drive in it that gives the balance and freshness in the finish. BBQ pork chops with fresh rosemary for me with this wine, don’t overcook them they need to be a little pinkish. This wine will age well for another decade but is too delicious to wait!
",Sangiovese
"Any fans of the Framingham wines should stock up on these beauties at an everyday price for a Sauvignon Blanc that's a definite crowd-pleaser. Juicy, bright, fresh, and just plain delicious. I picked up a bottle last night to refresh myself on this wine and before I knew it, half the bottle was gone, it was so easy-drinking and light on the palate. Crisp and mineraly, this is quintessential NZ Savvy without the overly present vegetal qualities. One of my new favorites on the shelf and made by such a great winemaking team, I'm happy to pick up this wine for any occasion.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"Fans of Sancerre or any other crisp, mineral-driven white wines: LOAD UP. This one of the most ridiculous deals I've come across yet from my esteemed colleague Mr. Woodhouse, the man who's been bringing us K&L drinkers stupendous values from the Southern Hemisphere since his arrival. Made by Andrew Framingham, a man whose white wines have become household staples among our sales staff, the 2016 Ribbonwood might be the best Sauvignon Blanc deal I've ever tasted in my career now entering its eleventh year. It's saline and citric in its character, yet the wine has texture. There's an herbaceous note underneath all of that, but it plays second fiddle to the minerality and the hints of orange blossom on the finish. This is not your grapefruit-laden, super green Kiwi Sauv Blanc. It's not anywhere near that now ubiquitous profile. This is much more Loire Valley in its flavor, but with even more fruit and complexity. For the price, all I can say is WOW, WOW, WOW. Do not miss this one. Buy as much as you can afford.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"Everything you could want in a classic, everyday NZ Sauv Blanc. This wine exemplifies that fresh, crisp, juicy style of Sauv Blanc that put NZ wines on the map. The nose is bursting with white blossom, citrus peel, jasmine and passion flower. The palate is crisp and zesty but also has a soft textural element and more layers of flavor than anyone would expect at this price point. 2016 has proven to be yet another stunning vintage in Marlborough and this wine shows just what stunning values the region can produce. Ribbonwood is the second label of one of my favorite producers in NZ - Framingham. The wines are made by the inimitable Andrew Hedley who is without doubt one of the most exciting, passionate and downright awesome winemakers you could ever meet. Don't settle for mass-produced, commercial, bulk NZ savvy when you can have something like this crafted by a master of his trade.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"This is an absolutely lovely Sauvignon Blanc which shows round fruit, pretty, apricot blossom aromas, and doesn't fall too far into the peppery, green category of New Zealand Sauvignon Blancs. Rather, its refreshing, pleasant and crisp. A great buy at this price!
",Sauvignon Blanc
"What the 2015s lacked in acid balance, the 2016s have in spades. Unfortunately the crop is small because of frost and hail and then draught. Franck Millet has fashioned a fine wine here-as good as their exceptional 2014.  Lemony, spicy, totally easy to drink right now.  Bring on the cracked crab or clams. Lip smacking good.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"The 2016 Franck Millet Sancerre truly shows off the reason Sauvignon Blanc is the grape for Sancerre.  Pure fruit freshness and notes of mineral with no green flavors often associated with SB.  The Millet family not only bring us absolutely lovely Sancerre, but at a very friendly price.  This wine has brought many smiles to the faces of friends who 'don't like Sauvignon Blanc', it's truly hard to resist.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"The nose is classic Sauvignon, a bit of grapefruit (no green peppers) with hints of dried herbs. On the palate the chalky soils become visible making a crisp and snappy appearance yet in this warmer vintage the wine's mid palate richness balances it perfectly. The finish is hints of grapefruit rind, anise and a lively focus. Perfect for grilled salmon.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"I've made a lot of friends over the past few years thanks to the wonderful wines of Franck Millet. They remain one of my very favorite Sancerre producers and their 2016 speaks volumes. It's rounder and more concentrated than the most recent vintages with no shortage of chalky mineral notes, lime, lemongrass and crisp acidity. A Sauvignon Blanc not to be missed.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"Although bit of a frost touched the region, Mother Nature's hiccup was not enough to deter producers from this classic AOC from creating yet another exceptional expression of Sauvignon Blanc, and Franck Millet's is no exception. With perfect concentration and balance, the soft fruit notes are paired with racing acidity and a slight grassy tang at the end, giving it a sense of place.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"I have been very impressed with all 2016 Sancerre I have tasted so far and Franck Millet is no exception!. Fresh, vibrant, with great mineral content, juicy acidity and long-lasting finish. Just pure expression of classic Sancerre. Considering the price it just can't get any better!
",Sauvignon Blanc
"Our visit to the Loire Valley would not have been complete if we hadn't visited our dear friends Franck and Betty Millet.   Clyde, myself and a friend were traveling through the region and arrived a day early to have a relaxing meal in the village of Sancerre.  We actually surprised the Millets by popping in to see their new house which sits on the hill of the village overlooking the valley of Sancerre and its vineyards.  We had an appointment to visit them the next morning but they were so gracious even with our surprise visit, they began pulling out bottles of wine for us to try, offering us food and a tour of their recently finished house.  I often point to these kinds of occasions when trying to illustrate why we try to develop strong relationships with our Direct Import producers.  Even though we were just stopping by to say ""hello"" they went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and a part of their family.  And that's why the Millets are part of our K&L family.  When we finally did arrive at the winery for our scheduled appointment we retasted all the wines as well as some of the new tank samples for the 2016 Insolite.  They had fresh cheeses and bread all laid out for us because they knew we were going to be traveling a couple of hours to our next destination.  We discussed the difficulty of the 2016 vintage due to the early frost but thankfully they were not largely affected by the staggering crop losses that others felt.  The quality of the 2016 was outstanding as usual, classic grapefruit and lemongrass tones, chalky minerality and a long citrusy finish with a whisper of wild thyme at the end.  Clyde's specific comments were ""better than the 2015"" and ""more my style, racy and classic.""  When Clyde saw some magnums, we immediately explored the notion (Clyde's a sucker for large formats) of adding that to our inventory set.  I of course love the little half bottles which are new as well.  So, in whatever format you choose, halves, mags or standard bottles, you'll hopefully share in the sense of gazing out over the vineyards of Sancerre and sipping wine with our dear friends Franck and Betty Millet.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"The wines of Domaine Franck Millet are always elegant and this is no exception.  Millet is a third generation grower/producer working in the highly acclaimed village of Bue in Sancerre.  On the nose, there are notes of under-ripe stone fruit, lemon and grapefruit zest and tons of minerality.  Millet forgoes malolactic fermentation, preserving the zippy quality of this Sancerre.  It has great acidity but also has a rounder palate due to a regular stirring of the lees for a period of three weeks to give this wine some nice roundness and body.  This would be a well-suited partner for a salad with chicken and goat cheese.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"I love the focus and minerality of most of the 2016 Sancerres. I do not love the fact the crop is small because of frost problems and hail. What the richer 2015s was missing is here in the 2016s-fine acid balance and a clean smooth finish. This 2016 is one of the best I have had from Franck Millet-packed with so much fruit but also with tremendous acidity and length on the palate. We will not get a lot of this short crop of Insolite.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"We've just received another shipment of one of Sancerre's finest wines! Franck and Betty Millet might not be on the cover of Wine Spectator, but they are superstars at K&L. We discovered the Millets back in the 90's, and their wines have only become better with each forthcoming vintage. The ""Insolite"" bottling marks their highest tier wine, grown all in white chalk, limestone soils, and it is truly one of the best expressions of Sancerre character that I've come across.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"I've tasted every vintage of the Insolite we've carried, and I can honestly say I absolutely love this wine.  My garage is always graced by the lovely wooden 6 packs my husband can't bear to part with!  The 2016 follows their tradition of extraordinary value in a spectacular Sancerre.  Somehow  achieving a richness and clear raciness at the same time, showing the succulent fruit qualities of Sauvignon Blanc as well as the mineral qualities of the chalky soil.  I can't really ask for anything more from a Sancerre, this has it all.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"This scintillating and racy wine gushes with Melon rind, Guava, Grapefruit pith, savory herb and mouth watering minerals.  This manages to be both lip smacking and serious at the same time.

"Located just 2 hours south of Paris in the village of Bué, 3rd generation vigneron Franck Millet and his wife Betty cultivate 22 hectares of beautiful, rolling vineyards together with a focus on Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir.  Their premium Sancerre bottling “Insolite”  (translated unusual or uncommon) brings together the most  expressive old vines Sauvignon Blanc from the Domaine growing on clay-limestone soil.In the glass the wine’s bouquet develops with yellow flowers and a bold expression of citrus cream.  A firm vein of wet stone minerality is accented by notes of fresh field herbs like thyme, bee-balm and dried grasses.  A refreshing wine on its own, yet not delicate at all and would love being paired with seafood, white meats or of course local goat cheese is classic; Chevre.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"Back just in time for the Holidays!  The grapes for the Insolite cuvée are selected from the chalkiest soils on their property in Bué.  Franck and Betty (the husband and wife team behind the estate) allow the wine to macerate with the skins at close to 32 degrees to coax as much aroma and flavor as possible.  On the nose the wine is fresh and racy with pronounced mineral tones, freshly cut grass, sweet green herbs and lots of fresh citrus and stone fruit.  The wine has some texture, almost a creamy feel on the palate with a zippy, lively undercurrent of acidity.  Considering that Dungeness crab season is in full effect, I would happily pair this with a big old plate of the good stuff, but this would work with any seafood really.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"You can't ask for much more at this price point!  Crisp, refreshing and lively, this Sauvignon Blanc from Touraine is full of bright citrus, notes of ripe pineapple and cut grass and an intense minerality.  Perfect for any occasion and priced right, this is one to buy a few of and keep around the house!
",Sauvignon Blanc
"The Touraine AOC is quite large with approximately 5500 hectares of vineyards on both banks of the Loire River between Saumur and Orleans. A broad range of wines are produced – white and red and rosé, sparkling and still. For white grapes, there is some Chardonnay and Chenin Blanc, but more than 80% of the wine produced is Sauvignon Blanc. The 2016 Les Roches Sauvignon Touraine is one of the best values we offer in a Loire Valley Sauvignon Blanc, a less expensive alternative to the Sancerre and Pouilly-Fumé which is produced just upriver. Very dry and crisp in style with lively citrus notes. Lightly savory and intensely mineral in expression. Terrific value at this price point.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"Back in stock for spring, the bright Les Roches is a crisp, picnic-perfect value from Loire's Touraine region. This customer favorite somehow shows complex Sancerre sensibilities for under ten bucks. While the last celebrated vintage was a hit, 2016 is even flintier, displaying an intense, classic nose of cut grass, tropical fruit and lemons, with plenty of minerality, sharper than 2015 but just as drinkable. Super refreshing, 2016 Les Roches Sauvignon Blanc is a great choice for parties, alfresco dining, or just to make weeknights more enjoyable.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a lovely wine from the Loire Valley in France.  It is full of lively acidity, pretty aromatics of delicate white flowers, and fresh squeezed citrus.  A great paring with fresh shellfish.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"Even in a classic vintage like 2016 this bottling always seems a bit more generous and open than most other Sancerres.  This is filled with lemon blossom, honeyed citrus, crushed melon and a mouth watering finish of talc-like mineral.  A best buy for sure.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"The 2015 Momo Sauvignon blanc has all the flavor you would expect from the varietal in New Zealand, but with a unique light bouquet of lemongrass, basil and citrus. The wine is unfined and unfiltered, and the natural yeasts that populate the vineyard are allowed to aid in fermentation without disturbance. The result is a Sauvignon Blanc that has texture and depth, but with a light, fresh approach.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"One of the best deals out there in NZ Sauv Blanc. Momo (meaning ""offspring"") is the 2nd label of  Seresin Estate; this is organic and biodynamically certified wine, from one of the top producers in the country at $15.99! The Momo SB has all the classic hallmarks of Marlborough Sauv Blanc but with extra mineral complexity and great textural presence on the palate. Hand-crafted, artisanal wine at a better price than most of the mass-produced generic stuff.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"A very well-balanced Sauvignon Blanc from Marlborough. Tropical fruit notes upfront flanked by jalapeno, lime zest, and lemongrass aromatics. Juicy and lively on the palate, the minerality and freshness of this wine really shines. Unripe guava and passion fruit play with lime juice and grapefruit zest flavors. Great texture and lift to this wine. A quintessential New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc for under $20!
",Sauvignon Blanc
"Cool ripe fruit, clean light green notes, penetrating minerality and snappy acidity.  Yes please, can it be chilled and waiting for me when I get home tonight?
",Sauvignon Blanc
"This is one my absolute favorite Sauv Blancs from any country and it's a bonus that it also comes from one of my all time favorite producers. This wine packs a lot of flavor in, thanks to low cropping in the vineyard, which concentrates all the energy and flavor into the grapes instead of the canopy. It possesses loads of tropical fruit notes and is juicy, bright, and fresh. Subtle herbal character is present thanks to the soils from the Awatere Valley, but overall the vegetal qualities are low thanks to heavy leafing in the vineyard. The people at TWR are farmers and really care about making quality, organic wines instead of  something fancy and overblown. A truly great Sauv Blanc.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"This is super intense with snap pea, gooseberry, crushed citrus and lemon-lime aromas and flavors.  Palate cleansing, mouth watering and focused, this is as easy to sip as it is food friendly.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"This is my favorite New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc at any price. It has everything that I want from this now famous style- clean grapefruit and serrano pepper on the nose, medium to light body, and a great bright, long finish with no residual sugar. This is one of our most re-bought wines in the store for a reason... Get out of the industrial production game and try these small production gems. This is a great value!
",Sauvignon Blanc
"Amazing new staple wine with the longevity to get you from summer to New Year’s! If you love the bright minerality of Sancerre but not the expense, try the Domaine du Vieil Orme Sauvignon Blanc. Exquisitely crafted, refreshing, and at a price that far belies the incredible quality, this is party perfection in a bottle. Crisp and crowd-pleasing, the Orme showcases Touraine's dazzling rocky terroir while maintaining easy drinkability and layered texture. One of our best Loire whites of the 2016 vintage - sophisticated, complex, and most importantly, delicious.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"If you're looking for a crowd-pleasing white for a get-together or party, this Sauvignon Blanc from Touraine should be at the top of your list!  It's fresh and vibrant with lime, grapefruit and a sort of limestone minerality.  There's an undertone of slightly under-ripe pineapple and lemon blossoms.  While this is still crisp and zesty, there's a slight roundness on the palate, as this wine spends four months maturing on the lees, giving it a little bit of creaminess that makes this a great cocktail wine to drink on its own or an easy match for any number of food pairings.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"While I'm already a fan of good Touraine Blanc, this one raised the bar a bit for me. Zesty lime aromas are upstaged by generous citrus flavors, mouthwatering acidity, impressive mid-palate punch and a lengthy finish. A serious value Sauvignon for sure.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"This organically produced sauvignon blanc is a new staff favorite. Bright melon and peach notes, friendly minerality, and softness are the key components to this easy drinker.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"I picked up a bottle of this and had it over the weekend and it was the perfect choice  for the warm California summer we have been having. It was incredibly bright and fresh and had super juicy tropical fruits. The minerality and acidity really brought it to life and the bursting fruit quality smoothed it out and made it incredibly easy drinking. It's a smashable wine, but also a very interesting one at the same time. A great NZ Savvy, perfect for warm summer nights. Loved it!
",Sauvignon Blanc
"Tohu is a beautiful example of Awatere Valley Sauvignon Blanc. Many people don't realize that Marlborough is actually quite a large area composed of several quite distinct sub-regions. The Awatere Valley sub-region is cooler and more exposed than most parts;combined  its deep river gravel soils this makes for highly aromatic wines, with bright acidity, white floral characters and plenty of zesty fruit. At their worst they can be downright vegetal...think canned asparagus...at their best (as in this instance) they represent an fantastically vibrant, dynamic, distinctive expression of Sauvignon Blanc that can be found no where else on earth. This wine has beautiful ripeness of fruit, juicy mouthwatering acidity and a stony mineral persistence that goes on and on. I'm so happy that folks at Decanter weren't scared to reward such an inexpensive wine with such a huge score (often reserved for much more ""prestigious"" wines) as I think it's a beautifully made wine that is a dazzling reflection of its place. This will be a staple for many, many people this summer and beyond.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"From one of the cooler sub-districts of Marlborough.  This has a light, generous personality.  Open knit with lots of citrus ranging from mandarin to ruby grapefruit and just a hint of Sauvignon grassiness.  Crisp but not tart, the flavors echo the aromatics but minus the green component. Friendly, delicious and reasonably priced, I anticipate drinking quite a few bottles of this off in the next several months.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"Another exceptional vintage for this excellent Loire Valley estate has produced a Sauvignon Blanc of brilliant character and an elegant presentation. Aromas of honey-dew melon, lime zest, and fig-like qualities leads to a rich, yet snappish, clean, and crisp set of flavors across the palate, with undertones of a chalky, slate-like mineral nature. The finish is refreshing and mouthwatering. The Bean has demanded that I bring home at least several cases of this wonderful Gem to to serve with our shellfish dinners or to simply have with an aperitif plate in the afternoon. A MOUTHWATERING VALUE!. …A K&L WINE MERCHANTS’ DIRECT IMPORT… ***** 12.5% ABV *****

"I love new vintage of Cherrier! Super delicious, classic Sancerre. Pure minerality with very bright crunchy acidity and vivid, slightly tropical fruit expression. Very impressive for Sancerre under $20! Very fresh and vibrant.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"A refreshing and bright Sancerre from one of our consistently solid producers.  This Sancerre has a fresh lemon zest quality, a present but not overwhelming note of white flowers, and a slightly vegetal green note.  It's got a racy acidity and finishes very dry.  For those of you who like your white wines crisp, this is a must try.  This would be lovely with seafood, chicken and hearty salads.  Personally, I want to have a glass with a big bowl of steamed mussels.  Delicious!
",Sauvignon Blanc
"Racy Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc.  With a cooler fruit profile than typical, Chilled tropical and citrus fruits, delicate herbal notes and a hint of minerality.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"A classic Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc. Tropical fruit upfront; a plethora of guava, passion fruit, and gooseberry. Green bell pepper and herbs intermingle as well. On the palate, ripe guava and gooseberry come back to play with Meyer lemon with notes of chervil. Juicy; the acidity is racy, great texture. A fantastic Sauvignon Blanc for the price point; a perfect party wine or summer sipper.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"The 2016 Idiart Touraine Sauvignon Blanc is a classic Loire expression of the varietal. Winemaker Nicolas Idiart, who takes painstaking efforts in his craft, allows the grapes to sit with the skins to extract fresh, lemongrass flavors, and then cold ferments before aging the wine on the lees for a short time. There is a wonderful richness of texture in this spectacular value of a wine, due to the batonnage the wine undergoes during aging. Overall, one can't find a better Sauvignon Blanc at this price point, and lovers of Sancerre will swoon for this Touraine.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"With ideal weather conditions toward the end of the growing season the 2016 vintage has produced flavorful and fruit driven wines, especially for the Sauvignon Blanc plantings in Sancerre.  This years vintage of Domaine La Clef du Recit is juicy and refreshing with an almost passion fruit like tropical note on the nose along with lime zest and ruby red grapefruit flesh.  The fruit meets an intense limestone mineral component and the palate has mouthwatering, lip smacking acidity.  Perfect for lovers of a zesty Sancerre, but would also satisfy those who gravitate toward Marlborough Sauvignon Blancs.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"This wine goes through all stainless steel tanks during its fermentation, preserving freshness and vibrancy. It is a gorgeous Sauvignon Blanc with aromas of pomelo, grapefruit peel and lemongrass. This delightful white will pair beautifully with some smoked trout or grilled sea bass over a bed of greens and citrus.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"I'm always amazed when I taste the Carrick wines that they can be priced so incredibly low given their undeniably phenomenal quality. Everything that would make this an expensive wine - organic farming, hand picking, barrel fermenting are applied here and yet the price does not reflect these insane labors. Francis Hutt is without doubt one of the best winemakers in New Zealand and his farming and cellar skills are evident in this wine. Carrick is an underrated label and I wish I could put it in as many hands as possible. This wine is layered and complex, mineral driven, bright, juicy, and insanely delicious. One of the best white values in the store by far.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"A rare and unusual beast - Central Otago Sauvignon Blanc. In a region known for its premium Pinot Noir very few people plant precious acres to Sauv Blanc that grows so abundantly and successfully elsewhere. Yields, farming and and extreme climate in this mountainous region make it hard to justify planting a grape that rarely commands even half the price of its much revered competitor Pinot Noir. Therefore when I see people working with the grape in this region it generally peaks my interest. This is a beautifully flinty, mineral driven style. Grapefruit, jasmine, feijoa fruit mingle with struck match and savory lees qualities. Organically grown estate fruit, wild fermented in neutral French oak for texture and complexity.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"The Kalinda North Coast Reserve Sauvignon Blanc is a wonderful alternative for those who want a lighter white, but don't necessarily love grassy aromas or flavors. With lemon and salty mineral aromas, this Sauvignon Blanc delivers freshness, but also ripeness of fruit and an opulent texture. Served chilled, this is sure to be a fabulous wine for warm Summer gatherings, and a perfect compliment to grilled fish and vegetable kebabs.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"I am in total agreement with Clyde’s review of this amazing, killer SB. After being here at K&L for over thirty years, I have seen a ton of excellent SBs that were produced for us come and go, and I don’t think any of them would come close to the wonderful aromatics and flavors of this one. In the nose, you will be treated to a distinctive, opulent set of aromas of honeydew melon, lime zest, Chilean Jasmine, and ripe apricots, all of which carries over brilliantly to a bright, perfectly balanced, voluptuous, yet clean and crisp set of refreshing flavors that leads to a mouthwatering, rich, long finish. If you were to serve this Gem to me blindly, my first reaction would have been a great, single vineyard Sancerre from a great vintage and from a great producer. The Bean is absolutely in love with this Gem and has ordered me, in no uncertain terms, to bring home cases of this great SB for our consumption for the next three to five years. A K&L Wine Merchants' exclusive. SUPER VALUE!!!***** 12.9% ABV *****

"When I am not working in the customer service department,  I want to be at home enjoying our refreshing new Kalinda Sauvignon Blanc. It's clean and delicious and it makes me want to spend the entire day by the pool!
",Sauvignon Blanc
"The K&L owners started our house brand Kalinda in the mid-1980s so there have been at least 35 Kalinda Sav Blancs since then with many great successes from top notch estates. This new release may be my all-time favorite. Super clean and shining SB with striking aromatics of light apricot, lime and white flowers. Fresh, crisp and delicious; a fantastic warm weather sipper! Buy it early and heavy.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"This refreshing Sauvignon Blanc opens up with delicate aromas of "" Duchess of Angouleme"" pear  and citrusy undertones, which immediately reminds me of  Sancerre. On the palate it's clean, fresh and has lovely mineral touch. Light but full of charm and has wonderful bright acidity.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"This will definitely be my go-to summer sipper this year! Fresh peaches, bright citrus, pineapple and subtle spice come together in this Sauv Blanc and it's simply delicious. With high quality fruit coming from fantastic vineyards throughout the North Coast, you can't go wrong with this bottle.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"I've tasted a lot of Kalinda wines over the years (there have been many memorable vintages), but I've never been personally more excited to drink this year's North Coast sauv blanc. While the wine was produced in Napa (and some of the fruit hails from there), over 50% of the crop is from Lake County where it didn't get nearly as hot, so the wine is fresh, crisp, and clean on the palate. Rather than the grassy notes of New Zealand, the minerality of Sancerre, or the richness of white Bordeaux, the Kalinda brings something uniquely Californian to the mix: a perfect palate of fresh stonefruit. This nose is bursting with nectarines. Everything about it makes me yearn for summer and the warm months ahead. There's a ripeness of fruit, but there's plenty of acidity and the wine finishes clean and dry. My colleague Ralph Sands and I were trying this together in the tasting bar, looking at one another in delight, and envisioning Giants baseball on a Sunday afternoon with a few bottles of this in the ice bucket. This is a home run for our Kalinda label.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"Great Sauvignon Blanc sourced from the California North Coast and made by a high caliber, well known Napa producer.  The fruit is rich and poised, with lemon, melon, tangerine and gooseberry flavors, a refreshing acid zip and great balance.  This can be used either an elegant poolside sipper or the perfect accompaniment to a seafood feast but at this price you’ll probably want to grab a case to keep on hand this summer.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"This wine has pretty stone fruit and a slight herbaceousness on the nose. It's light and crisp and perfect for a warn sunny day. Nothing is overdone in this Sauvignon Blanc, it is balanced and the slightly tart acid keeps you wanting more.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"I give this a perfect score and it is the best Sauvignon Blanc we have made so far.  And that goes back to the first one 1984 from Boeger (still holding great color). This wine was made by a very famous winemaker from a very famous winery in the Napa Valley.  Hint- Mr Parker scored this winemaker as ""winemaker of the year"" a few years ago. And that is winemaker of the year for the whole world as we know it.Perfumey, floral aromas mixed with citrus nuances. Rich and lively on the palate-great zest and verve. Some spice, some lime and a very toasty character. Summer is approaching but this will do well served with a chicken dish.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"Back again a perennial favorite at K&L the Te Mata ""Cape Crest"" Sauvignon Blanc. This is no typical NZ Savvy; this is white Bordeaux in disguise; think Dom. Chevalier Blanc. Here we have a fully barrel-fermented wine consisting of Sauvignon Blanc (85%) with contributions from Semillon and Sauvignon Gris. The composition is actually a reflection of Te Mata's mature vineyards (25-30yrs) that are actually inter-planted field blends of these varietals draped across the slopes of the Havelock Hills. The fruit here is concentrated and ripe expressing yellow tree fruits, nectarine, poach pear and lilikoi with a subtle citrus cut. The French oak fermentation adds spice, texture and a rich yeast / lees component elevating the wine to another level. The presence and length on the palate is astounding. Whilst drinking beautifully now prior experience tells me this is also a wine that will only continue to improve with mid-term cellaring...I have some 2011 Cape Crest that is just singing right now. This is a very serious wine for a very economical price point. We have sold out of this wine fast in all prior vintages at K&L and it has amassed quite a loyal following with our customers and staff alike. Don't miss it.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"It's pretty clear that our NZ buyer Ryan Woodhouse is trying to put Sancerre out of business. The K&L staff loves the mineral-rich, crisp and clean flavors of French sauvignon blanc, but it's tough to justify spending $25-$30 when Ryan brings something incredible like the Fromm La Strada SB for $16.99 and it scratches that same itch. This wine is absolutely delicious, piercing with acidity and food-friendly flavor. It's a sauvignon blanc I would put in a top tier category, but our direct import pricing makes it seem like an every day deal. Don't be fooled, however. Serve this at an upscale dinner or a special occasion, but save some serious cash.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"Another facet of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc.  This wine has subtle concentration and richness, minerality and great cut.  It is not your typical lush, grassy Sauvy, in fact we sell Sancerres that can only dream of being this good!
",Sauvignon Blanc
"Really special Marlborough Sauv Blanc with concentrated citrus and yellow stone fruit flavors. Crushed herbs and pronounced flinty minerals add lovely complexity to the wine that has exquisite balance and persistence on the palate. A very fine example of why NZ Sauv Blanc is so celebrated.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"This Sauvignon Blanc has a lot going on!   Just about 15 miles inland from the Pacific coast in Chile's Aconcagua Valley is where this vineyard is nestled.  The nose has bright citrus, dried herbs, green apples and Satsumas.  The palate has refreshing acidity, with candied lemon and a hint of green peppercorn on the finish.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"This Savvy is extremely expressive with the fruit and bright acidity punching right out of the gate. I loved the tropicality of it and the minerality lended to it by its coastal clime. The fruit is juicy, energetic and fierce and the mouthfeel is full thanks to its time in both stainless steel and French barrique. This is a fun and lively Sauvignon Blanc and an absolutely perfect Summer wine.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"This refreshing Sauvignon Blanc has very nice fruit without being sweet, a subtle pepper like note on the nose, and no grassiness to speak of. The folks at Matetic in the Casablanca Valley have come up with a great summer sipper with this 2016!
",Sauvignon Blanc
"Real deal Sauvignon Blanc here! While Sancerre is synonymous with Sauvignon Blanc, and New Zealand continues to produce many great examples, Chile has been busily building the case for their crisp, mineral driven Sauvignon Blancs as well. Matetic produces one of the very best values. Its lively citrus, brisk salinity and granite driven minerality combine to make a refreshing summer white, one of our best values early on in the summer sauvignon season.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"Very refreshingly crisp, with an ever slight  pétillance. The tropical notes of guava along with grapefruit, make this well balanced Sauvignon Blanc a delight at any occasion, any time!
",Sauvignon Blanc
"Fresh, crisp and bright, the style of this wine is different from Rombauer's opulent reds and trademark buttery California Chardonnay but this is only their third vintage of Sauvignon Blanc and admittedly my first time tasting it. I was hooked at the first sip. Tropical fruit, lively acidity and a nice, long finish had me reaching for that second glass. Delicious.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"This wine is perfect for those who love a ripe style of Sauvignon Blanc, with flavors of white peach, pear, lemon & lime zest, and various tropical fruits.  For me, the acidity really stands out in this white wine, making this wine pop and bringing out a nice freshness. Slightly herbal note on this as well. A great domestic Sauvignon Blanc for under $20!
",Sauvignon Blanc
"I found this Sauvignon Blanc from Napa to be very Loir-like and surprisingly refreshing.  This is only a touch grassy with a middle of crushed citrus fruit and melon rind and a super refreshing finish hinting at mineral.  This is a real winner for folks who like their whites lively and crisp but with plenty of fruit.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"The lively, no oak influence Sauvignon has lifted aromatics of peaches and citrus, it is very refreshing, and a perfect accompaniment to salads, seafood and oysters. The fruit comes from the famed Ink Grade Vineyards, with its cool mornings and warm afternoons influencing the crispness, and ideal ripeness of this perfect aperitif wine.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"Named for the calcareous soils of the Tabordet Estate, ""Calcis"" is clean and dry, and as you might expect, has a long, mineral driven finish. There is some barrel fermentation in the production, which lends a slightly richer quality to the palate than other Pouilly Fumés, but the overall impression is delicate, with notes of white peach and lemon zest.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"A lovely aromatic profile with notes of dried tropical fruit and lemon peel accompanied by a bouquet of fresh tarragon and chervil, bourbon vanilla, and ginger. On the palate, flavors of dried pineapple and lemon curd are accented by crystallized ginger. While the wine possesses a round mouthfeel, there is an inherent freshness to the wine. This charming Bordeaux Blanc is drinking quite nicely now. If contemplating cellaring, this will age gracefully over the next 10-15 years. A fantastic choice when needing to choose a white wine for a special occasion
",Sauvignon Blanc
"This rich white wine is a powerhouse! It is composed of 75% semillon and 25% sauvignon blanc from d'Yquem's estate vineyards in Sauternes. It has the right amount of honey to set off the grassy notes of the sauvignon blanc, and an unbelievable amount of length and laser like focus. They use 80% one year old barrels that were used once for d'Yquem, and the balance brand new oak, and yet the oak is barely a feature in the wine. This is concentrated stuff!
",Sauvignon Blanc
"Pineapple and coconut aromas.  Perfect botrytis and acid balance. Liquid gold.

"Our visit to the Loire Valley would not have been complete if we hadn't visited our dear friends Franck and Betty Millet. Clyde, myself and a friend were traveling through the region and arrived a day early to have a relaxing meal in the village of Sancerre. We actually surprised the Millets by popping in to see their new house which sits on the hill of the village overlooking the valley of Sancerre and its vineyards. We had an appointment to visit them the next morning but they were so gracious even with our surprise visit, they began pulling out bottles of wine for us to try, offering us food and a tour of their recently finished house. I often point to these kinds of occasions when trying to illustrate why we try to develop strong relationships with our Direct Import producers. Even though we were just stopping by to say ""hello"" they went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and a part of their family. And that's why the Millets are part of our K&L family. When we finally did arrive at the winery for our scheduled appointment we retasted all the wines as well as some of the new tank samples for the 2016 Insolite. They had fresh cheeses and bread all laid out for us because they knew we were going to be traveling a couple of hours to our next destination. We discussed the difficulty of the 2016 vintage due to the early frost but thankfully they were not largely affected by the staggering crop losses that others felt. The quality of the 2016 was outstanding as usual, classic grapefruit and lemongrass tones, chalky minerality and a long citrusy finish with a whisper of wild thyme at the end. Clyde's specific comments were ""better than the 2015"" and ""more my style, racy and classic."" When Clyde saw some magnums, we immediately explored the notion (Clyde's a sucker for large formats) of adding that to our inventory set. I of course love the little half bottles which are new as well. So, in whatever format you choose, halves, mags or standard bottles, you'll hopefully share in the sense of gazing out over the vineyards of Sancerre and sipping wine with our dear friends Franck and Betty Millet.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"I've made a lot of friends over the past few years thanks to the wonderful wines of Franck Millet. They remain one of my very favorite Sancerre producers and their 2016 speaks volumes. It's rounder and more concentrated than the most recent vintages with no shortage of chalky mineral notes, lime, lemongrass and crisp acidity. A Sauvignon Blanc not to be missed.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"The nose is classic Sauvignon, a bit of grapefruit (no green peppers) with hints of dried herbs. On the palate the chalky soils become visible making a crisp and snappy appearance yet in this warmer vintage the wine's mid palate richness balances it perfectly. The finish is hints of grapefruit rind, anise and a lively focus. Perfect for grilled salmon.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"This wine is fresh, with a slick texture and a round mouthfeel with edgy acidity. The fruit and minerality complement each other beautifully. A crisp white wine that has great flavors and a long finish—what more can you ask for?
",Sauvignon Blanc
"The gorgeous Elephant Hill Sauv Blanc is a benchmark for Hawke's Bay. It's certainly not what you'd expect from most $15 NW SB! The nose is powerfully rich and complex, but without the typically grassy notes, instead lovely herbaceous mineral quality and deep ripe lemon fruit. It's somewhere between a great Graves White and a top notch Sancerre. The palate is textural and equally complex with a subtle building acidity and a lovely touch of brine on the finish. A stupendous example of the potential here and a stellar price.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"I recently re-tasted this wine and fell in love all over again.  This bottling from Domaine Di Vieil Orme is richer and waxier than their entry-level selection.  It's delicious, unique and a fun departure from your ""typical"" Sauvignon Blanc.  There's a peachy, stone fruit note along with citrus blossoms and limestone.  The fuller body carries a lovely texture onto the palate and stays fresh with well balanced acidity.  This is well worth the couple of extra bucks!  This would also be a great choice to bridge the gap with family and friends who all like differing styles of white wine.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"This is one special, complex wine from the Touraine region, which is 100 percent Sauvignon Blanc, but presents a complex bouquet of dried stone fruit, chalky mineral and bright lime blossom. When I tasted it with the staff, we were all compelled by It's oily, waxy texture and rich midpalate, which was tempered by a balanced acidity and distinct minerality. Inphini is ridiculously delicious and surprising, and a must have for those who typically enjoy Vin de Savoie blanc, but want to try something a bit unusual.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"The ""Iphini"" represents Vieil Orme's ""Cru"" Touraine. Here there's more weight, concentration and riper fruit flavors than their outstanding regular bottling and the added richness and complexity are worth the slightly higher price. Great on its own or with food.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a killy Savvy from one of New Zealand's most exciting producers. The fruit is coming off a malnourished, stony part of the vineyard, which may not sound like ideal conditions, but actually forces the vines the concentrate all their energy into the flavor of the grapes, because they struggle in that environment. The Sauv Blanc is light and bright with great concentrated fruit and no vegetal character thanks to a lot of leafing in the vineyard. Andrew Hedley is a minimalistic winemaker utilizing wild yeast fermentation, neutral barrels and extended lees contact to give depth and body to the wine. Finally, a different expression of the most popular NZ varietal and definitely something to put on your tasting list.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"Grown in a high elevation vineyard in the Adelaide Hills, this Savvy definitely highlights the cooler climate with bright acidity and zippy citrus fruits. This is not your typical Sauvignon Blanc from Australia and not one you will find by many other producers in Oz. This is more akin the Sancerre than to other whites in the same area. It’s expressive, vivid, and juicy. A great choice if you’re looking for something different or are new to Adelaide Hills.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"I'm stoked on these new wines from Radley & Finch! The labels are quirky and fun but the wine inside is way more serious than the sub-$10 price point suggests. Radley & Finch is a new project / partnership between young gun, rising star winemaker Thinus Krüger and boutique S. African wine importer Pascal Schildt. Basically they got sick of cheap, poorly made S. African wines flooding the market and decided to do something about it. Thinus makes the majestic FRAM wines that we also sell at K&L and has access to great fruit. Pascal has the know how to get the wines here economically so we can sell this premium juice at super sharp price points. The Sauv Blanc is a zesty citrus driven wine with clementine, mandarin and zippy acidity. Some subtle herbaceous edges are balanced out by a dash of Chenin Blanc in the blend that adds depth and texture. Porch pounder / summer sipper...have at it!
",Sauvignon Blanc
"Another release that over-delivers from staff favorite Ancient Peaks! Hailing from the southernmost (and coolest) point in Paso Robles and aged for five months in stainless steel, this Sauvignon Blanc is crisp and bright with subtle muskiness and vivid tangerine fruit.  The 2015 is a killer value to drink well beyond summer.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"This wine goes through all stainless steel tanks during its fermentation, preserving freshness and vibrancy. It is a gorgeous Sauvignon Blanc with aromas of pomelo, grapefruit peel and lemongrass. This delightful white will pair beautifully with some smoked trout or grilled sea bass over a bed of greens and citrus.

"Another winner from Amici! I tried this for the first time on Tuesday, 30 August and just fell in love with it. My palate runs toward acidity and citrus flavors and this beauty has that in spades. Lemon/lime, grapefruit and an wonderful minerality make this a domestic version of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc. Although it is does see some oak, it is very light oak and well-integrated, at that. Some tropical notes on the finish. Do NOT wait to buy it! Minuscule production.

"Granny smith apple, lemon zest,  chalky minerality and a bit of toast and texture from lees contact and barrel fermentation, with very refreshing, zesty acidity. This is one drinkable Sauvignon Blanc!
",Sauvignon Blanc
"A wine that was many years in the making. Talking with owners / winemakers Jason and Anna Flowerday about this wine was very revealing. For many years they have flirted with the idea of making a single block, barrel influenced Sauv Blanc from their home block of vines. They have repeatedly kept a small parcel separate and fermented it in a large 600L neutral French oak Puncheon barrel...but year after year they ended up blending it into the TWR ""regular"" Sauvignon Blanc bottling. However - in 2015 the wine quality, their confidence and the fruition of the ""SV5182"" program (a marker that distinguishes their BioGro organic certified estate wines from a couple wines that included growers fruit) meant that this experimental wine finally made it to bottle as a singular expression...and boy was it worth the wait! This is next level  stuff. This wine was ultimately conceived in the vineyard; the rows selected for this endeavor are set up from the very beginning with this expression in mind.  Super low yielding, hand tended vines mean concentrated fruit with depth and texture. The influence of the barrel is purely for lees contact and oxygen rather than any noticeable oak flavor. The wine has amazing purity, layers of texture, intense minerality and a persistence of flavor intensity that elevates it above it's multitude of Marlborough counterparts. I suspect it will age beautifully as well...certainly putting a case in my cellar to find out!

"Fresh gooseberry, citrus, and tangerine on the nose, followed by juicy tropical notes of pineapple and mango fruits on the palate. Combine those with refreshing acidity and a nice oak notes, this is a CA SB lovers dream wine!
",Sauvignon Blanc
"Bright citrus, exotic pineapple, juicy peach and a silky finish makes this wine easy-going and a smart pick for an everyday Sauvignon Blanc. The combination of new oak, neutral oak, stainless steel and concrete egg aging give this wine complex flavors, medium body and some subtle mineral notes from the concrete. Lovers of fruity whites should give this a try!
",Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a must-buy for any California Sauvignon Blanc drinkers. On the nose, fresh lemon and lime first welcome you. Bright acid and exotic tropical fruit fill the palate, while soft hints of oak help give it structure and a great dry finish.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"This has great, clear passion fruit flavors with mineral smoothness and a racy acidic core.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"A delightful Sauvignon Blanc. Crisp and refreshing without being aggressive or tart.  Ripe apple with hints of citrus and a whiff of grass.  Pleasantly textured this is a great wine to have around the house.  Perfect for poultry, fish or any assortment of vegetarian dishes.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"Snappy and focused, this single vineyard Sauvignon Blanc from Comartin is a new favorite for me. The wine is neither too light nor too vegetal, yet maintains a crisp, citrus-dominated acidity that keeps it fresh and vibrant. On the mid palate it shows lovely round exotic fruit and honeydew melon notes. Very well-made and sure to appeal to a variety of palates!
",Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a super tasty Napa Sauvignon Blanc in the make of great Bordeaux Blanc. It is beautifully crisp and fresh with great florals and citrus notes complementing ripe lychees. Where the comparison to Bordeaux comes in is with the wonderful texture. The primary vineyard in Rutherford is planted to mostly Musque clone and Semillon - responsible for the floral tones and weighty texture respectively. The also gracefully blend Sauv Blanc and Semillon from around Napa to give freshness,  lift, and intensity to the wine. All for a smashing price.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"Yes, Cos makes an excellent Bordeaux Blanc (since 2005) which is a blend of 75% Sauvignon Blanc and 25% Semillon barrel fermented in 15% new oak.  Smokey and exotic, bright and tropical with gooseberry, citrus, pomelo, and crystalline minerality. We won’t get much but we secured what we could on the spot.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"Blows you away from the first sniff with lime blossoms, crushed seashells and white flowers while on the palate. Sour lemon, pink grapefruit and spice all marry with just the right amount of rich oak accents.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"We loved this at the property- refreshing, lively entry with long, clean finish.
",Sauvignon Blanc
"85% Sauvignon Blanc.  Clean and lemony on the palate.  Good Value!
",Sauvignon Blanc
"The white Avocat for me is a classic white Bordeaux. It processes a nice balanced richness, with a lanolin, honeyed nose, along with a broad palate. The addition of Sauvignon Gris definitely makes its beautiful presence known. The full breakdown of the cepages is 50% Semillon, 40% Sauvignon Blanc and 10% Sauvignon Gris
",Semillon
"A perfect 5 for value. 2015 Sauternes are fabulous. The yquem 2015 in 375 ml sells for 179.99. A case of this or a bottle of Yquem?  The fruit in this bottle comes from the Suduiraut vineyards so it can't be bad.
",Semillon
"One of the best deals in all of Bordeaux and a Sauternes of Classified Growth quality.  This is lush and lively with tons of tropical fruit and creme brulee.  The mouth watering flavors of Pineapple are over the top on this outstanding value.
",Semillon
"This is a great choice for those seeking a rich, flamboyant style of Sauternes coupled with mature flavors and texture.  Deep golden color and a viscous texture compliment the mature flavors of Apricot, toasted marshmallow, baking spice and clover honey. A slight hint of paraffin adds aromatic complexity to the thick, smooth finish.
",Semillon
"Perfect Sauternes year and near perfect wine.  Great value. Lush but balanced.
",Semillon
"This is drinking nicely now and shows lots of life for the future, with a zing of bright acidity still keeping the richness in check. Heady beautiful nose  with botrytis and apricots dominating. The palate is layered with pineapple upside down cake coming to mind, burnt sugar, graham cracker, baking spices and lemon curd and a finish that doesn't quit. Wow.
",Semillon
"There are some grassy, maybe slightly musky aromas on the nose, but a nice clear, floral aroma that is able to punch through. Yet the real exciting part of this wine is what happens on the palate. I was totally blown away by this wine. It has the beautiful, refreshing body and texture. The acidity is totally dialed in and exactly where it needs to be. The fruitiness is scaled back--this wine exudes sheer elegance. The lemon notes are there, as well as some quiet tropical tones, but the texture, weight, and balance of this wine really does all the talking.
",Semillon
"I tasted this at our weekly Staff Tasting on Tuesday, the 9th of May. I have always been a fan of Smith-Haut-Lafitte, both the red and the white but, this 2013 vintage Blanc is simply outstanding. It has the Smith-Haut-Lafitte cleanliness but, has a quite rich center palate with nectarine, melon and tart lime flavors. A very nice, lingering finish. This vintage for this wine is just lovely! Do not be afraid to stick it the cellar for a few years...it should age beautifully!
",Semillon
"Thick fruit, with complex pear and persimmon notes.
",Semillon
"This semillon is one of the most inspiring Argentinian wines that I have ever tasted. The Aleph is loaded with waxy, complex, intriguing flavors, and has full body, not from oak, but from real concentration. It might seem expensive in context with other wines from the same country, but is an outstanding value as a wine. This would be a great ringer in a lineup of expensive white Bordeaux!
",Semillon
"Argentina has around 900 remainining hectares of Semillon vines, many of them brought over in the first half of the 20th century. In this case, these 70 year-old  vines yield a lovely wine with waxy white fruit and a soft texture. Roberto, whose family hails from Galicia, Spain, suggests serving this delicious white with octopus.
",Semillon
"Very cool Semillon. Classic green tinged, waxy, yellow tree fruits, stony minerals and citrus pith. The old vines (1940) lend great concentration and soil quality to this. Great value. I love Semillon!
",Semillon
"Crafted from vines planted in the 1940s, this  Semillon is an incredibly interesting wine – especially for the price!  The nose is rich with honeyed citrus, spice, and tropical fruit.  The palate has that classic Semillon weight and texture, but is also extremely fresh.  The Aleph really showcases how great and balanced Semillon can be when made with care.  A must try!
",Semillon
"Not overly sweet and very fresh, the 2015 Suduiraut is balanced and fine. For me it seems like a more delicate wine then in years past. Expressive and lively.
",Semillon
"This is just lovely stuff; just a classic Sauternes in every way. There's a perfect balance of lush hedonistic fruit, with ample sweetness, and a long, lingering finish of candied lemon zest and mango followed by just enough tanginess from the acidity. Wow.
",Semillon
"There's a lovely tropical mai tai note right on the entry of the 2015 Coutet, followed by a firm mineral note on the mid-palate and mouthwatering acidity on the finish. There's a new school of thought in Bordeaux at the moment that perhaps more Sauternes should be enjoyed young as an aperitif, rather than solely as a mature dessert wine. This Coutet is a prime candidate for that new mindset. It's absolutely delicious now!
",Semillon
"The ’06 vintage was not great for Sauternes due to heat and other climatic conditions, but properties who took the time to crop and leaf thin to attain ripe, pure grape fruit made some excellent wine, and this includes Doisy-Védrines. There is a lack of botrytis in this vintage, and with this  wine, but it is still wonderfully rich, honeysuckled, succulent and thick on the palate. The nose is perfumed and distinctive, with ripe floral notes and a butterscotch set of aromatics. All the guys have told me that this will be our house sweetie for the month. 13.5% ABV. (Jim Barr)
",Semillon
"THE WHITE WINE DEAL OF THE VINTAGE. You heard it here first. In all seriousness, this was one of the most impressive wines I tasted from anywhere this vintage and it was on our last night in Bordeaux (when I was about ready to stop drinking wine period!). It was lovely and subtle on the palate with a leesy richness and a firm mineral note on the finish. There was finesse. There was beauty and elegance. There was soft fruit and refreshing acidity. I've just convinced myself to buy some now having written this all out.
",Semillon
"**One of the wines of the vintage** At our first tasting of the 2015 d’Yquem 'en primeur', we immediately knew it would rank along the epic 2001 and the reveled 2009 Chateau d’Yquem. The botrytis aromatics and perfume jump out the glass. The palate is incredibly saturated – exotic yet precise, pure, and lifted finishing incredibly balanced, so long, and in reserve. This is a singular Chateau d’Yquem and absolutely breathtaking. All purity and class.

"One of the greatest wines I have ever tasted is the 2001 d'Yquem. Upon tasting the 2015 d'Yquem my immediate thoughts were that it could rival the 2001!! Liquid gold doesn't do this wine justice, absolutely loaded with dried pineapple, apricot and butterscotch notes this powerful, almost painfully seductive wine is as smooth as it is rich. If I were on my deathbed my last wish would be for a glass of this elixir.
",Semillon
"This is indeed ""liquid gold"" We tasted it in April 2016 at Cheval Blanc and we were knocked out by its purity and seamlessness. By far the best Yquem since the glorious 2001 vintage.  This may surpass it in quality. Honeyed tropical fruit, orange marmalade, pineapple, and sweet creme brulee aromas In the mouth, it is full-bodied with gorgeously refreshing acidity as well as massive concentration. Refreshing and as perfect as perfect can be.
",Semillon
"It is very hard for any wine as venerated as Chateau d'Yquem to live up to the expectations that its fame creates. This 2011 delivers on all promises- it is great wine. While it is only a light straw color now, it has authoritative viscosity, full, clean botrytis sweetness and a kaleidoscope of complexity that is impossible to duplicate. Put this in your cellar and forget it for many years and it will be even better than it is now. Wow!
",Semillon
"I don't know if I should call the 2015 Yquem the best wine I've ever had, but I can safely say that no other wine in my decade of working in this business has made my knees buckle, my heart murmur, and my mouth utter an F-bomb in the middle of a fancy en primeur tasting event. We were at Cheval Blanc for lunch and the 2015 Yquem was being poured as an aperitif in the parlor before the meal. I took one sip and it was like angels were trumpeting down from the heavens. I looked at my co-worker Phil and I could see in his face that he was having a similar, quasi-religious epiphany. Then I swallowed, closed my eyes, and took in the breathtaking finish. The 2015 Yquem is the whole package. It's a once in a lifetime wine, perfect in every way, without one symmetrical flaw. The fruit is so pure and concentrated you can almost see the dried apricots in your mind's eye, the acidity so balanced against the lush fruit and sweetness that any potential fatigue or overload from pure decadence is quickly erased. Your taste buds will be begging for more, and that's how the 2015 Yquem tastes right now...in its youth!! Imagine in a decade or two where this thing might be at. This is as perfect of a wine as I've ever tasted. I'm just hoping I get to taste it again someday.

"The 2015 Y'quem was one of the highlights of the highlights of the 2015 Bordeaux vintage trip! Ultra rich and complex with layers upon layers of fruit, this wine shows hints of pineapple, citrus and honey. The finish seems to go on forever. This is truly a special wine that I would love to have in my cellar!
",Semillon
"Garnering two possible 100-point scores plus a swath of high ninety point marks, the 2015 d'Yquem is already flirting with perfection.  Boasting a complex nose of apricots and dried pineapple, I found the wine to be particularly racy on the palate, especially considering how warm the vintage was. There's no shortage of superlatives when it comes to d'Yquem as it is unquestionably the finest dessert wine on the planet.  This is a ground-floor opportunity to secure a potentially historic wine and considering the going rate for what its been compared to already, its an absolute steal!

",Semillon
"The balance of the 2015 is what caught my attention when we tasted in Bordeaux this year. I thought the wines were utterly drinkable in their youth, yet classically structured with acidity simultaneously. The Guiraud is the perfect example of this phenomenon. There's bright acidity on the entry, but it's tempered by delicate flavors of tropical fruit and ample sweetness, all in perfect harmony. I'll definitely be going deep on Sauternes as they become available.
",Semillon
"Bright and fresh with hints of lemon and orange, the Doisy Daene is clean and elegant in the mouth. It is high toned and lively on the finish. Great acidity!
",Semillon
"This is a fantastically elegant bottle of dessert wine from the producer that has the most right to call themselves the greatest wine in the world. Full of pure stone fruit on the nose, this wine is only now getting a slight hint of caramel after some time in the bottle. This is a perfect foie gras Sauternes, which is not so heavy as to slow down the rest of the meal, and with plenty of long, focussed acidity to cut through the richest of pate.
",Semillon
"The best Yquem I've had in years, complex layers of coconut, pineapple yet focused, not allowing the sweetness to overpower it truly a great one. I'm unsure of how long to put the drinking window on this wine, I'll be long gone by the time it runs out of vigor!

"Such a fun, clean, and easy-going Syrah from just off the Columbia River. The nose shows plenty of black fruit with a hint of bacon fat, which really pulls you in and gets you excited for the first sip. Great texture and concentration, the touch of black pepper and truffle on the palate flavors will pair brilliantly with some BBQ! At this price, get a few while they last.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"Typically, wines at this price don't possess the dense, ripe depth of fruit that this fun and juicy Syrah does. Traditional blackberry and boysenberry fruit on the nose and palate is accompanied by a subtle touch of pepper and vanilla.  A touch floral on the nose, the Columbia Crest delivers and then some with its beautiful blackfruit and baking spice palate and long smooth finish. 
",Shiraz_Syrah

"Talk about bang for your buck! The 2015 Columbia Crest Syrah is a juicy, medium-bodied red that jumps from the glass with flavors of cocoa powder, spice, vanilla bean and black cherry fruit.

"Don't let the $9.99 price fool you: Columbia Crest has been pumping out deals like this since I was a teenager, consistently and continually providing some of the nation's best bargain bottles with no-frills, straight-forward wines like this Columbia Valley Syrah. What will wow you about the 2015 expression is how much it tastes like real, classic American Syrah. It has dark-fruited concentration, hints of pepper and spice, with blueberries and bramble on the finish. It's clean, well-made, and should provide you and 20 of your friends with plenty of good juice for NFL Sunday afternoons or holiday parties where volume and efficiency hold more weight than complexity. I can't say I'm surprised the wine tastes this good, but I can that I'm stoked we have plenty of it.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"It's hard to find this quality of Syrah for this price anywhere in the world let alone the Rhone Valley. The 2015 of the Remizieres Crozes was a breakthrough wine for us as it gave our clients access to the Northern Rhone for a very reasonable price.  No doubt it was special as people came back for more, again and again.  It became one of our best selling northern Rhone wines of all time.  And from a small estate producer??  But that's what our Direct Import program helps us do - bring you quality wines at great price points.  So how does the 2016 measure up?  Beyond favorable, it is brighter and more overt than the 2015 which makes it so appealing now.  It has great acidity and smoother tannins, sweet black plum fruit and savory spices.  The 16 is not as concentrated, as 2015 was a warmer vintage overall, but it is fleshy, vibrant and good to go.  I am thrilled we were able to establish this direct relationship with Remizieres.  They have continued to wow us at all levels of their production from this humble little red, to their sultry whites to their deeply powerful Hermitage.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"This is a tremendous follow-up to the epic Remizieres 2015 Crozes-Hermitage we offered last year. If what we as the staff buy at K&L is any indication of quality, I bought more of Remizieres Crozes-Hermitage than any other wine, ever. Currently, I’m on track to beat that with the 2016. For lovers of Syrah, this is an absolute must-buy. Where you going to find a $16 Syrah anywhere that has the focus on quality and the hand-made production you find here? It’s upfront and fruity with all of that black pepper and spice goodness that you’re looking for, along with zesty acid and black fruits. It’s broad and full without going over the top, and retains that balance you’re only going to find in the northern Rhone. I can’t say enough about the staggering quality for the price of this wine.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"The newest vintage of this direct import was decidedly young upon its arrival at K&L. But with a couple months to rest in the bottle, it has relaxed into a wine perfectly representative of everything that makes me such a nerd for Northern Rhone Syrah. The woodsy cedar and sawdust on the nose, accompanied by a dusting of white and black pepper, are folded into the layers of brambly raspberry, blueberry, red currants, roasted herbs, violets, and subtle dark cocoa. Medium-bodied with extremely comfortable, seamless acidity, this is versatile, food-friendly, and remarkably affordable for Crozes-Hermitage.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"This delicious bargain Syrah seems to be getting a bit richer with each new vintage yet retains the white pepper and violet aromas as well as the palate coating but fresh blue and black fruits.  This is an all around great N. Rhone red that over delivers.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"I've been fortunate enough to visit the cellars of Remizières a couple of times now and it is always an impressive journey. The attention to detail that Emilie and her brother Christophe Desmeures have is evident throughout. This is fully revealed upon wandering the rows of concrete tanks, the beautiful barrique, and the large foudre - all of which are of the highest quality. From top to bottom, whether it be an entry Crozes, small parcel selections like the Cuvee Christophe, or to the top tier Cuvee Emilie Hermitage, the wines have beautifully delineated fruit and clarity of terroir. It's no surprise that the 2015 ""Cuvee Emilie"" Hermitage was a huge standout. First tasted from tank in 2016, it was deeply concentrated loaded with raspberry coulis and coffee notes. It was one of the reasons we struck up our direct relationship with them. In early 2017, we visited again to check the progress of the wines and it had gone from an almost overwhelming mouth-filler to a classic Hermitage. Deep dark fruit with harmonious flavors of roasted black raspberries, candied dates, and soft notes of vanilla and sassafras. The wine was still mouth filling, but all the final components had been married together for bottling and it showed the detail and poise I had come to expect after tasting all their other wines. There was a nationwide distributor that originally imported the Remizières wines with severe mark-ups, but our direct relationship provides a clear path to a benchmark wine for the best price in the US market. On a side note, we had lunch with the Desmeures clan after our cellar visit last year and they brought out some older Crozes and Hermitages for us to taste through. With the beauty and complexity those wines displayed, there is no doubt the 2015 Cuvee Emilie Hermitage will have a long a prolific life and should round out to be one of their greatest wines produced.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"Their 'Originals' Syrah is made from the oldest plantings they have and are also the oldest in the Ballard Canyon. Because of the age of the vines and use of dry farming, the yield is less than other blocks on the property. The small clusters of fruit they do produce are both rich and concentrated. They sort the fruit, using mostly whole clusters and ferment in cement, relying on the stem influence to add wood texture and tannin. The wine is elegant, powerful and focused allowing the limestone soil to fully show its influence on the vineyards. Blackberries and blueberries are in the fore front while undertones of pretty red flowers, smoke, and just the right amount of black pepper give the wine complexity and richness.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"With a creamy texture and rich, vibrant flavors, Holus Bolus produces some of the most delectable Syrah of Sta. Rita Hills. Mocha, cedar, brambleberries, black pepper, and vanilla fill out an impressive flavor profile and silky, but powerful texture. Pair this with roasted lamb for a perfectly hedonistic dinner.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"This is exactly the kind of domestic Syrah that I'm looking for! Not some ripe, extracted berry bomb, but a bright, spicy balanced red that packs a punch on the nose with some straight-off-the-vine wild berries, crushed pink peppercorns and savory smoked meat gaminess. While it did take a few minutes for the dynamic aromatics to appear, it was well worth the wait because the marriage between the articulated bouquet and the ample yet lifted weight on the palate demonstrates how using grapes from a slightly cooler vineyard in a ""warmer"" SoCal climate can lead to a syrah with elegance and balance.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"Another outstanding effort from Black Sheep Finds. Showing substantial blackberry and blueberry fruits upfront with voluptuous body and a trace of sweet spiciness on the nose. Oak is present but elegantly restrained and there is a vivacious acidity that balances everything out into a long, satisfying finish. A fantastic expression of Sta. Rita Hills fruit from producers that never disappoint.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"I always enjoy this gem from Santa Rita Hills, and the 2013 has all the usual depth and dark berry fruit, plus a smoky quality that elevates the whole drinking experience. Although richness is evident, Holus Bolus feels more Northern Rhône than traditionally juicier California Syrah, and will pair well with gamey food.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"A bright and spicy Shiraz with the perfect amount of juicy fruit without the opulent texture that many have associated with Australian Shiraz. This is alive with red berry character and that high elevation, cool climate acidity that balances everything out. A great value.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"For those in the know Eden Valley is a very special place. Sitting adjacent to its more famous neighbor Barossa Valley (though often lumped in together) the higher elevation and cooler climate of Eden produces a very different breed of Aussie Shiraz. The wines from here, as exemplified by this fantastic release from Yalumba, have beautiful balance and finesse to go along with the powerful fruit and richness Aussie Shiraz is known for. The fruit is fragrant, juicy and vibrant (likely elevated by the dash of Viognier in the ferment).  The wine has lovely exotic spice, some floral notes and savory elements like peppered bacon and hot stones. This is still a medium to full bodied wine with tons of concentration and power but it has a beautifully judged element of restraint that makes is such a pleasure to drink and very versatile with food. At this ludicrously low price point I'll certainly be breaking this guy out at plenty of BBQs this summer season - simply unbelievable value for money for a wine of this quality.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"This is an incredibly unique take on Shiraz from Yalumba. This winery has knocked it out of the park with a wine that is mineral driven and more elegant than many Barossa Shiraz's. This wine exhibits the richness that Shiraz in Oz is known to possess, though it manages to do it without any of the overly ripe flabby character. I was pretty blown away by the price on this guy given the value I think it brings to Aussie Shiraz. If you are unfamiliar with Eden Valley, this is the perfect, affordable wine to bring you into the fold.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"Yum! All the juicy flavor of real syrah/shiraz with none of the cloying, overly-sweet, ridiculous ripeness that made most of the genre impossible for me to drink for nearly a decade. This is balanced, savory, perfectly-finessed Northern Rhone style wine with smoked meat aromas and a peppery finish, all for a price that allows daily drinking. I'd recommend anyone with a bias against Aussie shiraz to try a bottle and free their mind. The secret is Eden Valley's higher elevation and cooler climate versus the hotbox that is Barossa. Go deep on this one if you like value and true Rhone style syrah.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"Tasted on 8/16 in our Hollywood store, this wine was a WOW.  Light on its feet, bright fruit and smoky black pepper, I was instantly in love. I've since had this wine with the classic dish ""chicken marbella"", and the slightly less elegant Amici's pizza...it was a winner each time!

"I'm pretty picky about my syrah. I like them fancy and cool climate. Very few under $20 suit my palate, but this exceptional offering should prove to everyone that Hawke's Bay is capable of making world class syrah for an incredible price. We already know Te Mata is the gold standard in NW, but at this price point it's also becoming one of the best value driven producers on our shelves. A nose of dense dark pepper, herbal brambly red and purple fruit and heady sandalwood. The palate is perfectly structured with evident but approachable tannins and a lovely lifted acidity. This is one to buy by the case and drink over the next 5+ years without questions one of the best values of the year.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"Building directly on Te Mata's reputation as one of the premier Syrah producers in NZ with the monumental ""Bullnose"" bottling this Estate Syrah brings much of that class and character to the table for a fraction of the price! A juicy, fruit driven style with ripe red / black fruits, spice and freshly ground pepper, this is the perfect wine for grilling this summer. Easy drinking, mid-weight, tons of depth and character to stand up to hearty foods. Exceptional value -  K&L direct import.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"I thought this was a spectacular offering from northern Rhone especially for the price. There is a lovely nose of red and blackberry that are underlay with a savory, almost meaty, component and dried floral notes. The body was restrained and focused although there was still plenty of fruit and structure. An absolute delight of a sub $20 wine.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"This (along with the other wines from Ferraton Père et Fils) really blew me away at our last staff tasting.  Michel Ferraton produces the wines with all native yeast strains and minimal new oak. They adhere to a bio-dynamic philosophy, although they are not certified bio-dynamic.  The nose on this is just SO good!  It's a melange of white pepper, bacon fat, beautiful floral aromatics and lovely dark fruits.  The palate is balanced and clean.  It's got great length but doesn't come across as super intense.  A really great wine for under $20!
",Shiraz_Syrah
"While this bottle still needs some serious decanting, and/or much needed time in the cellar, it's definitely worth it, once you do decide to open it.  Elegant, and super pretty, this is the bottle for Hermitage drinkers. After decanting for three hours and letting sit in the bottle for a full day, it was finally ready to drink, and the beautiful tannic structure was still lingering, showcasing wonderful flavors of nutmeg, black currant, and cinnamon. Easily one of the nicest bottles I've had from Northern Rhone.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"Here is a super complex yet elegant Syrah that sells for a song.  This has spicy blue and black fruits along with hints of red meat, pepper, iron and traces of iodine.  Despite the warm and generous  mid-palate the long finish is sweet, clean and crisp showing more traces of iron and pepper.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"This wine is a game changer.  Once you try this, you will think of New Zealand, Hawkes Bay in particular, when you hear Syrah.  The combination of climate and soils create a unique expression of this classic varietal.  Dark fruit and bright berries, cracked pepper, a savory element on the finish and enough acidity to focus all of the previous elements.  Dark, bright, rich and savory, what more can you ask for from Syrah? Oh yeah, it is only $20, try to find a Syrah with that much character for that price from anywhere else in this world!
",Shiraz_Syrah
"Notes of blackberry, violet, plum, white pepper and smoked meat are followed by silken texture and balancing acidity. An inviting Syrah that has depth, complexity and elegance all at a reasonable price point. Grill and chill with this full bodied gem from Elephant Hill.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"This vintage of the Elephant Hill Syrah is blend of 3 vineyards from around Hawke's Bay. This combo really helps to give the wine a great sense of balance with elements from all 3 vineyards and a true expression of the appellation. This Syrah has meaty notes that are balanced with stunning purity of fruit. Spice and structure from the small percent whole cluster shine through and the fruit is weighty and dense without being overly ripe or flabby. A killer red from a very highly regarded NZ producer, this wine showcases why Hawke's Bay has the stellar reputation it does from producing stunning Syrahs.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"Back in early 2011 I visited Elephant Hill for the first time and was simply amazed by the quality of the Syrah they produced. The 2009 release I was tasting at the time was a revelation to me and cemented my suspicions that Hawke's Bay could, without exception, produce some of the best Syrah on the planet. 2014 was a warm vintage by New Zealand standards which is good news for varietals like Syrah when they're planted in a traditionally cool climate region. This wine strikes a perfect balance between traditional northern Rhone type characters of violets, spice, smoked meat and earth; combining them with a more modern purity of fruit, polished texture and brightness. Any review of this wine would be remiss without a mention of the wine's deliciously ""umami"" cracked black peppercorn notes. The consistent presence of this fresh ground pepper character is something that I believe sets Hawke's Bay Syrah apart and makes it truly unique. This is an exceptional wine, from a great vintage, direct from the winery at a ridiculously low price point.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"This Hawkes Bay Syrah from Elephant Hill was the red wine standout of our New Zealand staff tasting. If you love the classic Syrahs of the Northern Rhone, you owe it to yourself to try this beauty. It has a classic nose that explodes with white pepper, and medium to full body with excellent texture. Minty, eucalyptus like flavors last and last with good tannin and excellent acidity on the finish. Perfect for leg of lamb now, or the cellar for later!
",Shiraz_Syrah
"The Elephant Hill wines from Hawke's Bay have long been a staff favorite, but I think in this 2014 Syrah, the winery has reached new heights of greatness. This is honest, clean and classic in style, but with nice depth and intensity. Stylistically, this reminds me of some of the better northern Rhone wines, with strong black pepper spice, medium body and elegant red berry fruit. Yet there is a generosity and openness here that makes the wine eminently drinkable and delicious without having to stash in the cellar for years. Easily one of our best Syrah values in the store!
",Shiraz_Syrah
"This is a different take on Aussie Shiraz than most of our customers are used to as it comes from Langhorne Creek in South Australia. The cooling maritime influence this region possesses give this wine a lighter, slightly more saline/mineral-driven style instead of a deep, rich, supple one. There is still plenty of fruit here to showcase the varietal, but it's presented in a different way than from a region such as the Barossa. If you've been avoiding Shiraz from Oz because you think it's too fat or high in alcohol, or if you just want to taste a good, interesting Shiraz, this wine should be your next buy.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"Deep and brooding with dried plumb, cranberries, hits of sun baked, fresh raisins and a nice toasty essence that pulls it all together.  On the palate the wine is lush and fruit driven with additional notes of baker’s spice, and a distant camp fire in a woodsy setting echoing in the distance.  The tannins are gentle but the outside label is certainly anything but…
",Shiraz_Syrah
"This is not what you would expect looking at the label, and it has an awesome label.  This is not a fruit bomb, it has plenty of dark berry fruit with a little bit of earth and touch of spice and a wisp of classic savory Syrah.  It has just enough tannin to back the fruit and give a sense of restraint.  An ideal middle of the week, red wine.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"I'm in danger of repeating myself once again here...but this wine is just a perennial favorite that year in, year out delivers simply phenomenal value for money and fantastic consistency of top-notch quality. For those of you that haven't heard to story before here's a brief outline: John Duval is one of the most heralded winemakers of the modern era. He made one of the world's most awarded and coveted wines (Penfold's Grange) for 15+ years as Head Winemaker at Penfold's. He knows the Barossa like the back of his hand and sources the best fruit the region has to offer from some of its oldest vines. After moving on from Penfold's, John set up his own, eponymous label and continues to produce wines that are nothing short of world-class at prices that continue to amaze me. Our continuing support of these wines year after year means that we can offer the very best pricing on these wines that are already significantly under-priced to begin with, in my opinion...but I'm certainly not complaining!
",Shiraz_Syrah
"I am typically not one to be attracted to bigger, full-bodied wines such as Shiraz from the Barossa, but on occasion I run across one which changes my perspective. Duval's Entity Shiraz is just such a wine. With lengthy experience both at Penfolds and on his own, Duval is a winemaker who truly understands the Barossa, with its particular strengths and shortcomings. His wines are neither too over-blown, nor too restrained, rather they showcase the power and richness of the region in a perfectly balanced way. The Entity Shiraz is dark-fruited, full-bodied and soft, with excellent structure and good spice, but also clean and poised, without being over-ripe or flabby.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"This was one of the major standouts to me when tasting through the Ferraton line. Although I thought the entire line-up had a lot to offer, this one punched well above its weight class. Bright fresh berry nose with a little savory herb and leather leads to a precise and clean, open but with great length and focus. Classic notes of berry, spice, pepper, and floral all intermingle while leading to a long finish.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"During a recent staff tasting of Rhones, this wine stuck out in terms of Northern Rhone Syrah values.  It has a very bright and expressive nose of raspberry, violets, blackberries and black pepper, with good rich fruit but a nice balancing element of acid and earth.  This would be a knockout with a wild game meal.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"Truly a remarkable deal in Crozes-Hermitage! This wine is not only priced irresistibly, but drinks remarkably well even at this young age. Elegance and richness play well together here, presenting a wine that is full of open, soft, black fruit, but retains some cut and minerality that keeps the wine from being flabby or over-ripe. Domaine des Remizieres continues to impress at every level, and will no doubt reward some cellar time, if you can manage to hold on to a few bottles.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"I was stoked to add this producer to our roster last year after our visit. The Christophe takes Syrah up a notch with some élevage in oak foudre and demi-muid (larger barrels). More select parcels and richer fruit lead to a sensational palate of blue and black fruit with harmonious baking spices. It is a delicious star from the 2014 vintage.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"This is a softer approach to Syrah then a lot of it's California counterparts. The grapes are sourced from vineyards that sit 2500 ft. in the mountains and is one of the highest elevation vineyards in the state. The wine has velvety tannin and packed with elegant dark fruit. A flinty and mineral tone are found from the nose to the finish giving the wine complexity and texture.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"Last year this winery had a coming out party with its 2014 releases. They were highly scored in Wine Advocate and the door was ajar. Orders flooded in and the wines were sold out in a matter of days. This year we may run into a similar problem as again the scores are good and 2015 for Halcón, like most in California, was a very, very small vintage. This 100% Syrah blend from the estate vineyard high in the Yorkville Highlands (2,500ft) was fermented with 40% whole clusters and is full of the meaty savor that I love in Domestic Syrah. Superb aromatics of fleshy wildberry, crushed stone and burnt ends lead to supple caressing flavors of bacon, braised meats, blueberry and darkly roasted artisanal coffee. This wine is just beginning to unravel and if the past vintages are any indication will age slowly and gracefully for some time.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"Halcon's estate vineyard in Yorkville Highlands is one of the highest in California and has soils similar to that of Cote Rotie, giving Northern Rhone inspiration for the Alturas Syrah. This impressive, full-bodied Syrah shows elegance and aging potential with its complex aromatics and structure on the finish. Blackberry, pomegranate, vanilla, spice and subtle hints of floral notes bring this beautiful wine together.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"I cannot say enough great things about the people and the wine from the Stolpman Vineyards, they really are some of the nicest people in the industry. On top of their generous nature, the latest offering from their ""Estate"" Ballard Canyon Syrah is an instant classic and worthy of a multiple bottle purchase. Dark fruit, currant, fennel, and fresh herbs dazzle in the glass. The wine has an opulent and rich full body smothered in blackberries and fresh lavender. A long sophisticated finish make this almost irresistible. Try it with roasted lamb or grilled wild mushrooms.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"Kay Brothers continue to deliver the very essence of McLaren Vale. This is absolutely a regional classic that optimizes varietal and place. The perfume sways back and forth from dark fruit, to earth, to floral tones and back to savory smoked meat tones. Deep plummy fruit invades the palate with briary / garrigue notes, toasted spice, cured meat and liquored cherry. The palate is lush and concentrated, with fine, supple tannin and beautifully sustained length thanks to the wines natural acidity. This is an absolute joy to drink now and assured to go another decade in the cellar if you wish.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"This is the very definition of a classic Shiraz from one of the most well-respected and oldest  producers in McLaren Vale. It has a rugged, yet polished feel to it, clearly letting the land the grapes were grown in shine through. The centuries of practice this winery has had to perfect it's Shiraz have clearly paid off with a wine that showcases the best the varietal has to offer. Rich, but not fat, earthy, but not harsh, this is the epitome of balance and a beautiful example of what happens when McLaren Vale fruit and years of winemaking experience meet up.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"Kay Brothers Hillside Shiraz is truly one of the iconic wines of Australia's McLaren Vale and a perennial favorite.  Violets, chocolate and intense plum dominate the palate, however layers of dried meats, cracked pepper and fragrant spice are interwoven throughout.  It is long and deep with mouthwatering, savory layers emerging in the glass and a nicely balanced level of acidity and fine tannin. Uou will be forgiven for thinking of the great syrahs of the northern Rhone when tasting this beauty.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"Keep in mind that Hermitage can only come from one beautiful hillside above the town of Tain l’Hermitage. Just one. The granite soils, the steep slopes, and perfect south-facing rows produce a wine unlike any other. Due to these limitations, you typically pay an arm and a leg for the world’s greatest expression of Syrah. The 2014 Remizieres  “Cuvee Emilie” was priced so reasonably I swore that there had to be something off about it. There isn’t. This is stone-cold Hermitage, with insanely dense concentration, and a formidable wall of tannin that ensures this wine will be drinking great for years to come. I was further shocked at how well the wine performed after a decanting. This is a total gateway Hermitage for anyone who has been curious about the wines but turned off by the price. This one is worth it.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"Another example of what Syrah should REALLY taste like! Deep, blackberry fruit, hints of chalk and licorice, lush, full and complex. The finish goes on and on and on. Simply put, just a wonderful release from this producer that gives immediate gratification and pleasure.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"Entirely destemmed, the rouge captures the purity of Hermitage. It is deep and profound and requires just a short time in your cellar or maybe a long decant before consumption.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"It's easy to see why the Torbreck winery has stood the test of time with wines like these. Definitely crowd-pleasing and a good representation of the popular style of Shiraz coming out of the Barossa. This wine is not shy with its fruit and depth and has some structure and spice that play up those qualities nicely. If you are looking for a light bodied, lean-style wine, this is definitely not for you. It is unabashedly big, but seems to represent that style very well. A great BBQ wine and something many tastes will enjoy.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"Vineyard designate, limestone planted, 8 different Syrah clones, 35% New French Oak. This under $30 syrah is full of bacon fat, smoked meats, graphite, juicy blue and black berries, with good tannic grip. Really, really delicious syrah that is dynamite at the price!
",Shiraz_Syrah
"This latest offering of Syrah from Beckmen is one that absolutely speaks to me. Blackberry, pepper and bacon fat are all layered nicely on the nose. A soft and approachable full-bodied wine that offers plenty of generous fruit. Boysenberry richness gives way to a long, refined finish. Really great wine for under $30.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"This is a beautifully made syrah. It exhibits all the polish and finesse that we've come to anticipate from Eric Kent, yet without diminishing the raw, gamey quality of the grape. The wine is full-bodied with plenty of black currant and huckleberry notes up front, but with a lovely smoked meat quality on the finish and very subtle savory herbal notes. The tannins are firm, but ripe, and will certainly allow for aging if desired.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"OH MY WORD, this is a tasty, tasty Shiraz. Made from grapes from cooler sites, there is nothing but finesse, juicy notes, subtle minerality, and crisp dark fruits here. The hand-picked grapes are a revelation here as much of Oz is machine harvested because their innovative tech is often used in the vineyards. The gentle touch with the grapes is obvious, giving a vibrant and fresh mouthfeel. The inclusion of whole cluster gives more texture and structure to this wine and the unfiltered sediments mean it will age beautifully. This is one of the better Shiraz's I've come across in Oz and I sincerely hope I don't buy it all before the customers have a chance to try it.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"The Domaine de Tourettes is fleshy and rich.  Full bodied with loads of dark berry and brambly fruit.  The underlying character of a Hermitage comes through but right now fruit is on the menu.  Give it a couple of hours in the decanter or cellar for 5-10 years to release all the depth this wine possesses.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"New Zealand Syrah is far and away different from its continental counterpart to the west; Australian Shiraz.  The cool oceanic influence flowing over the famously gravely soils found in the benches of Hawks Bay bring together a confluence that rises to another level for the Southern Hemisphere.  Precision, expression and intrigue can emanate from the Syrah crafted with a master’s hands in this region.  The results have more in common with Northern Rhone than any misguided association with the closest famous neighbor; Barossa.  Trinity Hill’s 2015 “Homage” first presents itself with energetic tones that leap out before you even make it to the rim for your first whiff.  Blackberries, saddle leather and dry forest floor are the first salutations you receive which quickly broaden into cassis, bay leaf, and freshly crushed blueberries and raspberries.  The fruit is ripe, not cooked thanks to the chilling influence of the pacific.  On the palate the power of the wine is apparent but its exuberance is reined in by the notable structure.  The tannins in the young wine are ripe already and do leave plenty of room to experience the blackberry and bramble in a tactile expression.  While thoughts of beauty and synergy were some of my last impressions here, my true last contemplation was beef short ribs braised for hours and all would be perfect…
",Shiraz_Syrah
"Easily one of my favorite wines I have tried within the past year. The origins of Homage have their roots in the northern Rhône, with founding Winemaker John Hancock working there during the 1996 harvest. Trinity Hill first planted Syrah vines in 1995 at Gimblett Gravels, with cuttings from Hermitage specifically being planted in 2001. Both the original plantings and subsequent Hermitage vines are used to make Homage. The nose invites you with aromas of perfectly ripe blackberry, plum, and boysenberry. The bouquet is wide ranging, exhibiting spicy black pepper and floral potpourri, to woodsy characteristics, grilled meat, and charcuterie. On the palate, the wine possesses both power and grace. Berry medley, currants, and plum flavors are accompanied by lingering fine tannins. There is a noted herbal and garrigue flavor, with elevated acidity as well. The spicy flavor notes and robust nature of this wine make it suitable with North African cuisine. Think lamb tagine as a possible food pairing. This New Zealand Syrah clearly demonstrates its ability to last another 10-20 years with proper cellaring. An all-around showstopper of a wine
",Shiraz_Syrah
"The top scores across every publication are well deserved given the incredible complexity and quality of this wine. While it is showing a little tight and structured now, it most definitely has the capacity to age beautifully. The smaller yields of 2015 give this wine great concentration and definite black pepper spice at this stage in its life. It is lean and bright and a little grippy, but will open up, show its fruit, soften its tannins and will become an absolutely phenomenal wine in a few years time.  The cool New Zealand climate has done its work here and given us a wine with depth and intricacy. One of the stand-outs from Hawke's Bay and any lover of past vintages should jump on this one as well.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"The past two vintages of this remarkable Syrah sold out in a matter of days and it's very easy to see why.  On the palate, this is dead ringer for a refined, cool, and vibrant Northern Rhone collectible - a young and extremely promising bottling.  Perhaps a bit more lift and tension than the past few vintages, it has all the structure and depth to age for a few decades but will turn heads even now with a good decant.  If you're looking for finesse in Syrah, or value in collectible, ageworthy reds, this is a bottling that needs to be on your radar.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"The magic of David Powell's wines is quite hard for me to put my finger on. Sure they're powerful, rich, highly concentrated wines with explosive aromas and flavors...but then many wines deliver that type of experience. I recently tasted his ""entry level"" Barossa Shiraz here alongside another very highly regarded Barossa shiraz producers comparable wine. Both delivered real quality and the type of fruit weight and purity I would expect but this Powell & Son wine just had something extra. A sense of place, another dimension of savory, soil driven quality underpinning all that decadence. Callum (the ""& Son"" part) is starting to make his mark on the wines too. After an extended vintage working with the legendary Jean Louis Chave, Callum has implemented the use of more large format oak instead of barriques and seeks more finesse in the wines. There's a bright energy to the wines lifting all that density and keeping it long and vibrant. Seriously good...and what a value given the quality and pedigree.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"Barossa Shiraz is something that has to be tip toed around sometimes.  There can be too much baggage for some people, understandable.  This is a wine that is boisterous and exuberant but it is not over the top.  It is that last part which has been the problem.  Most people really like rich dark fruits. Most people like spice. Some people even like a little tapenade in their wine.  This wine has plenty of the former and a respectable amount of the later two.  Medium tannins and the secret ingredient, enough acidity to tie everything back together.  This is the wine to reacquaint you with Australian Shiraz.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"Powell & Son has become a standout in Barossa for its classic Shiraz style with an elegant and refined twist. While there is the beautiful fruit quality the sunny climate of Barossa is known for in this wine, it is in no way overly rich or ripe due to the structure and restrained winemaking style of this family winery. The excellent farming techniques ensure this Shiraz is picked early enough to retain acidity to balance out the succulent fruit. One of my favorite examples of Shiraz from this area, it has become the new standard for Barossa.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"As an advocate for all alcoholic specialties, I'm a big believer in understanding the essence of any particular style before criticizing it. I have to admit that I thought I understood the nature of all Barossa Valley shiraz years ago after getting hit over the head with high alcohol, big jammy fruit, and loads of sweetness. ""This wine just isn't for me,"" I remember thinking. My colleague Ryan Woodhouse, our buyer for Australia, has enlightened me over the last few years however and forced me to rethink some of my former prejudices. The Powell & Son Barossa shiraz is definitely big and powerful, but at no point is it out of balance of heavy-handed. In fact, it's deeply-concentrated, explosive, and lush on the palate with gorgeous aromatics and plenty of meaty undertones. ""This is what REAL Barossa shiraz should taste like,"" Ryan would go on to say. Now I've changed my tune completely. The Powell & Son wines offer bold flavors and incredible complexity to any wine drinker. Fans of zinfandel or smoky syrahs will want to grab a few of these. They're at the apex of the category in my humble opinion.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"Grown on a high elevation in Adelaide Hills, this Shiraz is nothing like one you would find in Barossa. It's leaner, higher acid, bright, with juicy, but not big or flabby fruit. If you are hesitant to try Aussie Shiraz because you think they might be too jammy, this is THE ONE you want to get your hands on.A winner and a great food or cocktail wine.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"As esteemed Australian wine writer James Halliday notes Shaw + Smith have a strong reputation as one of the best cool climate Shiraz producers in Australia. What I love about this wine is that it's not funky, under-ripe and savory just for the sake of proving a point. It's driven by juicy dark red fruit, lush ripe tannins; it stands with a medium-full bodied physique and is certainly not shy. What you won't find in this wine are big gobs of stewed black fruit, a burning sensation from 16% alcohol or charred new oak leaving slithers in your mouth. It's a sleek, pure, balanced style of Shiraz that gives you up front fruit, exotic spices and hints of gaminess but without any of the pit falls that beset wines on either end of the ripeness spectrum. This will be a big hit for lots of people especially at this price point.
",Shiraz_Syrah
"I was shocked after tasting this wine when I saw what it was priced at. I think this is an unbelievable deal for what I consider to be one of the better Shiraz's I've had this year. There is a lot of complexity in this wine and it hits all the elements I look for in a Shiraz. I appreciate the weight, but at the same time it's not overly ripe or flabby as some warm climate Shiraz's can be. The bottom line is, it is utterly delicious and something I'd be happy to pick up for any crowd.

"Syrah's are my all-time favorite red wines and the Streicker Bridgeland Block is a winner! The aromatics are mixed with some spicy notes while the balanced tannins and dark fruits please the palate on this medium-bodied Syrah.

"You don't often see Syrah coming out of Margaret River, as it is often regarded as Cab Sauv and Chardonnay territory. With incredible flavors like these though, I wish more people in the area were making it. There is a leanness and brightness here that can sometimes get lost in the warmer Aussie areas and a great mineral character from the soils here. I love the spice notes and thee pure fruit quality. This is one I will keep in my rotation.

"This single vineyard Syrah Rosé from K Vintners hails from Phil Lane Vineyard in Walla Walla Valley, which is distinct for It's distinctly rocky soil. This imparts a scintillating chalky, stony minerality into the wine, which distinguishes it from many other Rosés of It's ilk. Not only is the minerality extraordinary, but the wine itself is very light on the palate, with refreshing melon notes. There is amazing clarity in this Rosé, and it is absolutely perfect for a dinner party, as it can easily translate from an aperitif wine to a food wine.

"Dumol produces very little Syrah, but their offering in the category is an exceedingly vital contribution to the category. This bottling has more in common with Cote-Rotie than it does with other California Syrah, showing rather restrained at the moment, with loads of promise in the cellar. Dark, brambly blackberries and blueberries, a dusting of finely ground black pepper, savory roasted herbs and an earthy, clay-like minerality all contribute to the stunningly classic flavor profile. It is exceptionally well-structured; the tannins and acidity strike an interwoven harmony that deftly binds everything together without coming off as too ""grippy"" or ""tight"". This is enjoyable now with a few hours of airtime, or in 5-7 years with some lamb sausage.

"After spending my first three years working all over Napa and Sonoma County in the wine industry, one could say my palate is slightly burnt out on Napa and Sonoma wine; however, I still love seeking out new and exciting wines from the Central Coast and Santa Barbara, and the Para Maria from Stolpman is definitely a crowd-pleaser. Fruit forward, yet well balanced with acidity, for under 20 bucks, this wine is a very pleasant experience. Want to bring something nice to a dinner party without breaking the bank? Look no further. The Para Maria is an outstanding red blend, truly showing just how good Santa Barbara wine is.

"Deep purple color and sleek, ripe, purple fruit greet the nose with a slight rustic prickle. Just the right amount of richness on the palate with a touch of tannic grip and lively acidity.

"Arnot Roberts is a favorite of the wines of balance geeks and there's no doubt that they're doing something really special up there in Healdsburg. That said this does not strike me as something that should be reserved for the geeks, while it's certainly a vin de garde, there's an obvious depth and complexity beyond just the wild acidity. A wonderful ethereal violet color in the glass. Deep dark aromas of fresh cracked pepper over dark blue fruit. Wonderful earthy and exotic woodsy tones and a racy structure hints at the incredible depth behind the fabulous wine. IT's begging you to put it away til 2020 and I think those who can commit to a longer term relationship with this special bottle will be seriously rewarded.

"There's a good reason why so many of my colleagues have given praise to this wine. Not only is it a fantastic Rioja value, it has plenty bottle age and is drinking beautifully right now. Black tea, fresh herbs and earth is intertwined with lovely red fruits, firm tannins and a long, dry finish.

"So, so, good, this 2005 Lesmos Reserva! Having recently re-tasted the wine, I can say that it still shows intense, bright fruit, all the while with great aged nuances as well. Piercing dark cherry fruits and dark chocolate aromas on the nose lead to some terrific flavors on the palate. Adding to the strong attack and mid-palate intensity is a lengthy finish, tinged with salinity and a subtle woodsy,/littoral quality. Rich, layered, and begging another sip, this tastes like it should be, conservatively 2-2.5x more expensive than it is.  Drink now or cellar with confidence for another decade.
",Tempranillo
"Consistently one of my favorite wines in our Spanish selection! This small winery in Laguardia is one of the gems that buyer Joe Manekin brings in directly from Rioja Alaveza. Thankfully for us, they have deep cellars, with plenty of older vintages like this 2005 to charm drinkers! 2005 was one of the greatest Rioja vintages in recent history, and this little Reserva wears its bottle age beautifully. The wine is full bodied with dark fruits and softened tannins, the aromas are of leather, exotic spice, and blackberry. On the palate the wine has great length, and still shows fresh vibrant fruit, with just the right amount of softening and mellowing influence from its time in the cellar.
",Tempranillo
"One of my absolute favorite Riojas! Dry, savory and spicy. It has predominantly red fruit red plums), bright acidity, low but firm tannins, incredibly long finish that just never quits. Amazing wine to pair with lamb.
",Tempranillo
"Over ten years old, with lots of potential and only $20, I love this wine! A very complex nose that you just keep going back to over and over.  On the palate it is medium full with much more intensity than you would expect for any wine in this price point.
",Tempranillo
"Classic Rioja from a celebrated vintage, this lush Tempranillo shows some cherry and earthiness on the nose but finishes with deep elegant fruit, leather, fennel, softer spice, and that caskiness Spanish fans love from a good Reserva.  I am always in the Lesmos camp but this release in particular impressively over-delivers — unbelievable value for less than twenty bucks!
",Tempranillo
"What happens when you combine great flavors of rich, fleshy dark fruit, leather, and cocoa with great tannins and decent age?  You charge an arm and a leg, right?  Not so, with Señor de Lesmos Reserva Rioja!  This gem is drinking great, and you won’t have to skimp on the perfect steak to accompany it!
",Tempranillo
"With a decade of age, it is remarkable how much complexity and depth has developed in this decidedly underpriced bottling from Rioja. Maybe it's the excellent vintage, or maybe it's the traditional winemaking technique of the producer, but either way, this is a phenomenal effort that continues to reveal its layers of flavor (red currants, dried cherry, fennel, mushroom, and thyme to name a few) by the minute. While this could easily age another 5-7 years, it is in a superb window right now for pairing with lamb or Spanish morcilla. The price point is just stupid - it might be the best $20 wine in the store right now.
",Tempranillo
"This wine at this price almost seems to be a mistake. Beautiful and balanced the wine greets the nose with ripe dark fruit and hints of smoke and chocolate. The palate is full and lush, with a little tobacco spice blending into the ripe berry notes. Fine tannins complement the body and lead to an excellent lingering finish. A delicious Rioja from an amazing year and at a price that allows you to drink a few.
",Tempranillo
"Rioja fans take note! When ""wine geeks"" say that great bargains can be found in Spanish wines, this is exactly what they are taking about. At 20 bucks, you'll get a delicious example of a reserva from the excellent 2005 vintage! The wine is the color of deep maroon and radiates the scent of cherry soda and sandalwood.  On the palate, the flavors are more restrained, with notes of dark fruit reminiscent of fig and plum. Slightly peppered with clove and hints of tobacco, the body is medium, silky, and round with just enough fine tannin to keep everything delicately in balance. This is super drinkable tonight, and definitely worth putting a few bottles in your cellar for years to come. Super recommended!
",Tempranillo
"I love Rioja! With a vintage like 2005 you can't go wrong. This is very traditional bottle with wonderful earth and spice. The oak is very well integrated, so it is not over powering the plush fruit and spice on the palate. Rounded out by good acidity and super dry finish. Perfect for lamb or the next taco truck you hit.
",Tempranillo
"Roasted herb, leather, and iron meet up with salty, balsamic, caraway notions, and light shadings of toasted coconut, on the nose. Somewhat fresher than the nose might lead you to believe, the dusty fruit on the palate is still well seasoned with spice and anise. The tannins are fairly gentle, though sufficient to imagine a future for this wine: whether you hold it will be down to how patient you are! The acidity, while there, never makes its presence obvious. Great Riserva for a great price!
",Tempranillo
"A great deal in traditional Rioja, this wine is full of red fruit, spice and earthy undertones. This wine has the structure to last quite a while, yet it is drinking beautifully now. All for $20!
",Tempranillo
"Absolutely classic old-school Rioja! Earthy goodness with concentrated fruit and spice. The wine is very food orientated, dry, structured and with bright acidity. If a rack of lamb is in your future, this wine should be too!
",Tempranillo
"One of the best Rioja's I have had this year. Hailing from a warmer '05 vintage, this wine has in the moment appeal, as well as the depth and structure to last for another 10  without breaking a sweat. Red fruit and spice are wrapped together to form a wine of intesity and intrigue.
",Tempranillo
"From my favorite Rioja producer, this stunning, complex, high-profiled “Reserva” offers all the elements that I look for in a great wine: an opulent bouquet, abundant structure and depth, exceptional mid-range, focus, a broad and powerful fruit presentation, and a finish that is satisfyingly long and warm. Medium deep ruby in color, the nose is loaded with an anise spiciness in concert with currant and cassis-like fruit characteristics, with undercurrents of game and mild toasty notes. All of these remarkable features carry over to its extraordinary set of flavors and overall presentation. This Gem will age easily for another ten to fifteen years, but you will find it difficult to keep your hands off of it for the near term once you taste it. Rusty has anointed this wonderful Gem as one of our house reds for however long it is around and has ordered me to buy cases of it for our cellar. 13.5% ABV
",Tempranillo
"Stunning value for a fantastic Rioja. Very classic, soft spices, incense, raisins. Medium tannins, delicious and ready now, but it will age beautifully still.
",Tempranillo
"Upon first whiff, the 2010 Viña Alberdi is spicy, with the cedary oak notes nearly stealing the show. There are of course baking spices and pretty fruits as well, which both become more evident on the palate, where they combine with the oak for a nicely balanced, ""bien clasico"" expression of Rioja. This level of quality and traditional craftsmanship at under $20 makes this a must in your regular rotation!
",Tempranillo
"The 2010 vintage in Rioja was an exceptional one, and this Viña Alberdi Reserva is a great expression of the respective year. Comprised of 100% Tempranillo, this wine is aged for 2 years in American Oak barrel. The first year of aging is in new oak and the second year is in older aged barrels. The wine was manually racked four times by the light of a candle. Ripe red fruit aromas intermingle with notes of vanilla, dill and seasoned leather. Medium body, with silky tannins on the palate. Juicy ripe cherry, spiced plum, and tomato jam qualities reveal themselves on the finish. This wine is a quintessentially approachable Rioja. A fantastic choice to accompany various pasta dishes and meat-based paellas
",Tempranillo
"I tasted this bottle after it had been opened for our staff for 2 days (the good stuff always seems to get opened on my weekends...). It is still tasting great. The lovely nose is full of cedar box and deep dark blackberries. There is a strong mineral component to the lithe body. Somewhat unusual for being 100% Tempranillo, this is a perfect wine to explore the classic markers of the famous Spanish grape for those who wish to study. At under $20 bucks, its the perfect wine to enjoy any day you need a great bottle of red without fail.
",Tempranillo
"A modern approach to classic Rioja. Juicy raspberries and blackberries set the tone, while savory herbs and high toned acid round it out. A touch of cinnamon and pretty floral notes give way to a long dry finish.
",Tempranillo
"If you like medium bodied, earthy reds that go with food, this is a wine to buy a case of. Last night, Cinnamon and I had the Vina Alberdi from La Rioja Alta with a winter beef stew that I made. It was a stunning wine and a great combination. The savory dark Tempranillo fruit had just the right amount of rose like aroma to contrast its frame of cake like American oak and plenty of good acid to cut the rich stew. We found the 750ml size a bit small for something so easy to drink!
",Tempranillo
"The most important fact to know about the 2010 Alberdi is that it needs to breath. The difference between this wine thirty seconds after opening the bottle and thirty minutes is night and day. I decanted this beauty and was absolutely spellbound once the initial intensity blew off and the fruit opened up underneath. This is classic Spanish food wine, full of dark berries and chewy tannins. It's not a big juicy garnacha by any means, but rather an old school Rioja with finesse and style. It has restraint and on the finish there are lingering notes of wood and dark berries. Cook up a steak or a rack of lamb and dump a bottle of this in the decanter for some mighty fine living!
",Tempranillo
"Pours a beautiful deep brick red color, and offers dense aromas of raspberries, ripe strawberries, and aged leather with a hint of salinity.  On the palate, robust but fully integrated and silky tannins combine with a vibrant acidity for overall outstanding structure, underlined by the slight influence of vanilla and spice notes from the oak.  A powerful and well-balanced Rioja from an outstanding vintage.
",Tempranillo
"This wine over-performs. It offers delicious nice soft fruit flavors that are balanced out with structure and acidity. It is a young wine that is dry but packed full of flavor. Medium-bodied and ready to drink now.
",Tempranillo
"Quite a value for only $11. Initial aromas of fruits such as cherry, plum, and prune. Accented with a bouquet of soft baking spices and vanilla. On the palate, this wine shows a really wonderful elevated acidity and balance to the ripeness of the fruit. Tannins are well-integrated additionally. Flavors of red cherry, blackberry, and strawberry along with leather and spice. Tasty and affordable, this is a fantastic choice for a red wine under $15.
",Tempranillo
"Perfect party wine!  Here you have a flirtatious, ripe, red fruited nose backed with generous fresh cherry flavor and a hint of oak spice. This is a luscious, value-driven sipper perfect for your next BBQ. Recommended!
",Tempranillo
"An early release from one of our favorite Rioja producers, Bodegas Puelles, this delicious Gem is deeply colored, with a pure fruit bouquet that offers white pepper to black cherry to black olive scents with just a hint of slate-like minerality and cedar that accentuates its upfront tones. Broad, lush, deeply flavored, concentrated, and rich across the mouth, this Gem is still elegant and balanced to the finish, with a lovely complexity and focused presentation. Rusty has demanded that I bring home cases of this Gem for our enjoyment for the next five to ten years. AN AMAZING VALUE!!! >>>A K&L WINE MERCHANTS’ DIRECT IMPORT<<< ***** 13.0% ABV *****
",Tempranillo
"It’s hard not to gush about any release from favorite producer La Rioja Alta, but the 2008 ""Viña Ardanza"" Reserva is especially gorgeous. Cherry fruit, reminiscent of the most classic Tempranillo, shines from the glass immediately, with hints of smoke and heady spice followed by leather notes.  There’s lifted acid indicative of the colder vintage and brighter-than-expected red fruit, but this still drinks with all the deeper, old world elegance of serious Rioja. It’s both focused and luxurious in texture, and will age beautifully.  Perfect for the holidays and well beyond.
",Tempranillo
"The 2008 Ardanza (one of my favorite bottlings from one of my favorite producers) is brighter and leaner than the riper, juicier 2007, and is all the better for it. Dried, sour cherries waft from the glass, mingling with clove-y spices, cedar, tobacco, and that dried, autumn leaf quality I always get from the best Rioja. The medium-bodied palate continues to showcase the lifted, almost tart cherry while revealing more rustic, earthy tones. After almost ten years of ageing before release this is a great wine today, but has potential to age another ten.
",Tempranillo
"There is a wonderful freshness to the 2008. The nose is full of ripe cherries, pungent herbs, a little tobacco and spice, but most of all, a clean bright fresh scent. It's almost floral, but I can't place what flowers it would be. There is a great balance of acidity on the palate. It meshes perfectly with the toasty American Oak and notes of baker's chocolate. The body is full, but silky smooth. The tannins are very refined. I'm pleased to drink this bottle now and put a few in the cellar for future aging. A splendid way to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Vina Ardanza!
",Tempranillo
"The La Rioja Alta wines have been one of the most overlooked values in the entire wine industry since I can remember, and this 2008 Vina Ardanza is yet another example in a long history of great deals. Not only are you getting a serious Rioja for the money, you're also getting a wine with serious bottle evolution and secondary flavors like iron with savory, meaty undertones. This is a lamb or steak wine without question, and it drinks like some of the $100 - $200 bottles of great older Bordeaux vintages I've had in my lifetime, yet for a fraction of the price. We've sold wines like this from La Rioja Alta before, and we'll continue to sell them in the future. I just hope that each time we bring in a wine this good we continue to initiate more drinkers into the fold. It's not your fruit-laden, silk smooth, California Cabernet. This is old world wine with bottle age and complexity. It's exactly the flavor that makes great wine expensive, even though in this case it's shockingly affordable.
",Tempranillo
"This bottling of Viña Ardanza marks the first vintage where the Garnacha (20%) was sourced from the La Pedriza vineyard in Rioja Baja. The remaining majority of the blend is composed of Tempranillo (80%) sourced from their 30-year-old La Cuesta and Montecillo vineyards. An expressive nose of dark and red cherries, plum, and boysenberry; supplemented with notes of vanilla, clove, leather, and tangerine. The palate possesses well-integrated oak, elevated acidity, and silky tannins. Also has a marked freshness for being almost 10 years old. Dried cherries and mixed berries move into tertiary notes of earth, leather, and a noted vanilla and spice characteristic. An age-worthy Rioja that is showing quite nicely at the moment, but will only get better as time goes on. Can easily go for another 10-20 years in the cellar. All this for under $30? Done!
",Tempranillo
"One of the new Spanish releases I look most forward to tasting every year is La Rioja Alta's Vina Ardanza. The 2008, celebrating the 75th anniversary of this iconic bottling,  is absolutely delicious. In this colder vintage, the red fruit not only seems to have more cut than usual, but more intensity as well. Focused and refined, this bottling is the first featuring Garnacha from La Rioja Alta's Pedriza vineyard, where vines are planted in a bed of pure stones - there is no visible topsoil here. As usual, when this wine is on, we are truly hard pressed to think of a more delicious - or more ageworthy - red in the store for under $50.
",Tempranillo
"This is a fun and flirty Rioja!  Lively lush fruit, with balanced tannin and acid.  Hints of violets, juicy red berries and little cola on the nose.  This wine does not see any oak, so it is very fresh and ripe on the palate.  A great party wine, and under $10!!
",Tempranillo
"This is exactly the type of Rioja I seek out when the holidays come our way: inexpensive, brightly fruited, no oak whatsoever, juicy and surprisingly structured, with a fresh acid structure that makes it sing with food.  Unoaked Tempranillo is not always the easiest wine to produce, as it can show a heat stamp in warmer years and be reductive and firm in cooler ones. In great vintages like 2015, however, unoaked wines represent one of my favorite types of Rioja as they accentuate the grape's delicious inherent fruit, and show off the pleasing lightly tannic grip of a young red wine. For under $10, this won't break the bank, and you can afford to stock a case to have plenty of wine on hand for visiting friends and family. Highly recommended, sub $10 house red!
",Tempranillo
"If you are looking for a lively, energetic, every day red wine to meet all your basic needs, look no further. The Palacio Del Burgo Tinto Rioja is racy, fruit driven and bright on the palate, with notes of raspberry, red apple, stewed cherry, pomegranate and licorice. Tannins in this wine are soft on the palate but somewhat pronounced on the back end, which makes it a wine that can easily transition from hors d'oeuvres to the main course.
",Tempranillo
"This under-$10 Rioja is here just in time for the holidays. Bright fruit is front and center in this tinto from Palacio del Burgo, as it does not see any new oak aging whatsoever. Berry medley, baked cherry, grilled plum, and bramble aromas to start. A slight hint of dark roast coffee as well. On the palate, its freshness is apparent. I’m a big fan of the elevated acidity, as it balances nicely against the ripe fruit quality. Blackberry and ripe plum flavors are accented by a slight leather note on the finish. This wine’s price point is perfect for parties, as you can easily buy a dozen or so without breaking the bank. Two thumbs up for this value Spanish red!
",Tempranillo
"What a marvelous Rioja at a great price. I'll admit, I don't drink a lot of Rioja's usually, and this one specifically is a great introduction. With 8 years of age currently, this Rioja is smooth, slightly fruit forward, and overall a nice drinking experience.
",Tempranillo
"I am definitely a fan of this winery and was excited to get to taste a new one (for me) from La Rioja Alta and I was not disappointed in the slightest. This is one of those bottles that helps to showcase why I like Rioja as a region so much. Bright red fruit notes with plenty of earthy notes. Alternating sweet and savory notes with a lovely mouth feel, I was fortunate to taste this a day after it had been opened and it was screaming good.
",Tempranillo
"This bottling of Viña Arana is mostly Tempranillo with just a touch of Mazuelo (~5%). I was struck by the rustic nature of this wine. Aromas of hard cheeses, incense, clove, and cinnamon. There is a noted umami characteristic to the wine as well. Strawberries and red cherries are followed by orange peel, hard cheese, and a hint of Portobello mushroom. Ample tannins and a fresh, bright acidity throughout. Drinking fantastic now, it also can further improve with prolonged cellaring (aging potential is high with this bottling). Perfect with grilled meat or assortment of aged cheeses
",Tempranillo
"The Vina Arana is the type of wine that launches a lifetime of interest in Spanish wine, mainly because it's so damn good and so splendidly affordable at the same time. I fell into Rioja in my mid-twenties because it was the only category it seemed where the top wines were in reach of my elementary school teacher salary. The 2009 Vina Arana from La Rioja Alta is like a flashback to that time in my life: you get the benefit of some bottle age that has softened the wine over the last eight years, creating a silky and soft fruited palate that glides over the tongue. There is fruit, but there is also just a bit of sandlewood and savory notes--enough to entice you even further. In short, it's a wine of simple deliciousness and yet utter complexity. Best of all, you get both of those qualities for less than thirty bucks. You can feel like you're splurging here for a very modest price.
",Tempranillo
"As delicious as the ""904"" bottling is from La Rioja Alta, the Vina Arana gives you plenty of  traditional Rioja character, as well as a very good representation of house style, at one of the most consistent, and certainly one of my favorite, Spanish wineries in La Rioja Alta. Quite frankly, I could drink a bottle of this myself, particularly with a mixed plate of cured chorizo, cheeses and bread. It is the archetypal, traditional Rioja, showing off fresh and dried fruits, dried orange peel and pipe tobacco on the nose. Bien clasico! This leads to a palate that is bang on Rioja: supple, slightly savory, fruity, yet dry with balanced acidity. I should also add that it is mellow and more-ish, two key descriptors of the kind of Rioja I love to drink. While the nose shows some lovely development, on the palate the fruit shows admirable poise and freshness, as well as surprising volume and depth for an under $25 wine. It is no surprise that this is the wine of choice amongst the team of coopers, cellar and vineyard workers at La Rioja Alta! One of my absolute favorite reds in the shop right now, this wine is for drinking in quantity (quick pro tip: like the other wines in this stable, the Arana will also age a while!)
",Tempranillo
"Earthier and denser than the Vina Alberdi, the Vina Arana cries out from the forest floor. It has the wet earth tones of healthy soil blended beautifully with boysenberry and olallieberry sweetness. Fresh cut cedar adds a spicy intrigue on the long and vibrant finish. This is a textbook example of Rioja value.
",Tempranillo
"A remarkable direct import from K and L, the Castillo De Vinas, or ""Castle of the Vines,"" label from Rioja strives to produce ""Classic Rioja, rich and balanced,"" which is a fine description of this beauty. Aged a minimum of three years, the 2012 Reserva is a fine value, with lifted spice and floral aromas suspended over bright bing cherry, stewed strawberry, plum and creamy vanilla. The palate is medium bodied, but with a strikingly smooth, rich texture, with fine tannins and a very well balanced acidity. This elegant, effortless wine is just as well enjoyed on It's own with some good conversation as it is with a serious meal.
",Tempranillo
"This wine is an extraordinary value for the price point. A lively nose right off the bat with stewed red cherries, intense plum, and blackberry accented with aromas of cedar and clove. Lively acidity on the palate accompanied with integrated tannins. Notes of unripe red cherries, leather, and pointed vanilla. Subtle bouquet of cinnamon, dried herbs, and black pepper additionally. Fantastic choice with grilled chicken or pork chops.
",Tempranillo
"Be forewarned: Do not don one of the unwieldy medieval helmets shown on the front label while attempting to drink this robust Rioja, as it's far too tasteworthy to waste a single drop! Attired in deep red hues, this forward-drinking, effusive Reserva spent 18 months in both American and French oak. It resonates with fragrant aromas of black cherries, vanilla  and raspberries, revealing a layered palate of riper dark fruits embellished with a tinge of earth and char. Enjoy this now or over the next decade.
",Tempranillo
"Another immediate favorite from our newest Direct Import (DI), Castillo de Vinas! This Reserva is just beginning to demonstrate some of the more savory secondary elements that come with a few years in the bottle. Nevertheless it still exhibits quite a bit of fresh, full-bodied, dark berry fruit. The whole is tied together with classic Rioja ""red earth"" and spice notes, resulting in a very drinkable and delicious medium-bodied wine with excellent balance and length.
",Tempranillo
"Our newest Direct Import Rioja, this 2012 Reserva shows the richer, darker fruit quality of  this warm vintage. The wine also has underlying toasty and subtly smoky barrel notes combining with balanced acidity for a plump, richer expression of Reserva Rioja done right. A great wine to check out for those curious about Spanish reds.  There is a whole lot of material and a lot to like here....
",Tempranillo
"Hailing from a great vintage in Rioja, this delivers a whole lot of wine for under $20. Prunes, tomato jam, blackberry, and cherry intermingle with hints of vanilla, leather and red licorice. Dried red fruit and lengthy, plush savory notes are accompanied by a long finish. Texturally, this wine is rich but possesses a lively acidity that dances on the palate. Complex as it is crowd pleasing, this wine is perfect for your next dinner party with friends and family.
",Tempranillo
"Puelles is a classic Spanish producer that in previous releases has straddled the line between modern, fruit-forward drinkability and more traditional dusky Rioja. The 2005 – a killer vintage – feels like a throwback to the older style, more restrained than the powerful 2004 but just as enjoyable. There is balance here, with a distinct savory quality, but Tempranillo’s bright cherry fruit still shines through, with hints of tobacco and leather on the finish and noticeable (though well-integrated) oak. Puelles is a Direct Import that truly is a crowd pleaser: a rich but easy going Gran Reserva that sings with quality, unbelievably only $20.
",Tempranillo
"Puelles continues to release traditionally aged, beautifully crafted and developed wine with their Gran Reserva 2005, a classic Rioja with simultaneous depth and lift. Classic, if slightly darker, almost Bordeaux-like flavors abound: cherries, plums, crushed flowers, anise, olive tapenade, tea leaves, woodsy spice, tree bark, and graphite all kept afloat by the weightless acidity and wrapped in soft, dusty tannins. I'm hard-pressed to think of another $20 wine in the shop that comes close.
",Tempranillo
"Here is an amazing deal on ready to drink wine from  a very good vintage.  In Rioja Gran Reserva indicates the best of the best and here is one boasting 10 plus years since the vintage and still selling for less than $20.  This old vines bottling shows wonderfully mature flavors and aromas of dried cherries, cedar, a dusting of old leather and even a slight hint of maple.  Despite the complexity and maturity of the flavors the structure is fresh, lifted and fine.
",Tempranillo
"I must have sold over 300 bottles of the 1999 Puelles Gran Reserva Rioja myself, back in the day. At twenty bucks, that was one of the best crossover ""mature"" red wines we've ever carried as a company. The flavors had evolved into a rich and earthy character I usually associate with the finest Bordeaux wines, so I made sure to send all of my best Bordeaux drinkers in that direction. Enter the 2005 Puelles: the same wine from a more recent vintage, at the same price, that I think might even be BETTER than that legendary 1999. Tasting this with Joe Manekin, our Spanish buyer, I was practically jumping up and down. The wine pours over the palate with a soft and silky core of fruit, but not the ripe and juicy red berry fruit you see in a young Rioja. After 12 years in the bottle, there's a rancio character and a fineness to the tannins that one can only experience with older wine. The problem with recommending old wine to the general populace is that it's usually expensive! Not in this case, however. Here with this 2005 Puelles you're getting serious, serious quality and a fine look at how great red wine matures for a price that's almost too good to be true. Load up. Load up big.
",Tempranillo
"Quite a simple breakdown for this wine: Great vintage (check); fantastic producer (also check), carefully bottle aged for you by our DI  partners and 8th generation vineyard owners in the Puelles clan (yes!) The result is a wonderfully savory, sumptuous, beautifully balanced traditional Rioja that is delicious now and will continue to drink well for years ahead. At under $20, this might just be our best value in aged red wine in the store.
",Tempranillo
"I know calling this wine the best value in our store would be a bold statement, but it’s one I’m prepared to stand behind.  It spent two years in barrel, another decade in bottle and it is showing its age beautifully.  From a particularly warm vintage in Europe, the fruit is rich and layered but still retains its freshness and vibrancy with a bright acidity and smooth, integrated tannin.  It has savory notes of mushroom, forest floor and crushed gravel and that wonderful perfectly integrated Puelles oak profile.  Nothing compares at this price point.
",Tempranillo
"While I was a fan of the 2013 vintage of Ercavio, the 2014 is even better! With riper, more generous fruit, this vintage strikes a great balance between soft, luscious fruit, good toasty oak, and a hearty structure. This is a big, bold style of Tempranillo, that is well-composed and drinks beautifully now.
",Tempranillo
"This is the most serious Tempranillo I've seen from La Mancha. It is generously dark fruited, with hints of savory, wet tobacco underlying in the background and an impressive mineral thread running through the wine. Under $10 wines are occasionally tasty, even delicious, but rarely are they delicious and as seriously put together as this wine. I was impressed by the 2013, but this 2014 ratchets up the intensity while maintaining even more balance between the fruit, tannins and wood. The Wine Advocate review states ""It tastes like a much more expensive wine,"" I wouldn't fault someone for finding that cliché, but  if Luis Gutierrez says it then this praise is truly earned. I'm very impressed.
",Tempranillo
"A blend of Tempranillo and Graciano, this 2014 Crianza shows loads of delicious red fruit character and intensity for under $12. Our newest Rioja DI, Castillo de Vinas has Tempranillo and Graciano situated on prime, stony higher elevation terroir in the Rioja Baja, the result being a wine with loads of richness and character. Highly recommended.
",Tempranillo
"This is wine is a real value that delivers what it should and more . It is a medium bodied and dry with nice dark fruit and subtle earthy flavors. It will go well with  pork and chicken dishes. A good example of an easy to drink Crianza Rioja.
",Tempranillo
"For a long time my go to table red for $10 was a Rhone wine, and while I still love it this new Rioja may take its place. Although this wine opens with rich red cherry and blackberry note it is surprisingly light on its feet. Fresh acid moves it along and allows for a somewhat tart finish. This is a lovely little food wine and one that makes a great everyday offering that tastes more complex than the price would lead you to believe.
",Tempranillo
"This is a phenomenal deal in Crianza from a new producer in our portfolio! Clean, polished, and modern in style, this Crianza bottling has all the elements required in a favorite weekday red! The fruit is round, accessible and pleasant without being jammy or flabby. Likewise, the structure is just soft enough to allow for near-term drinking, without compromising any integrity or balance. Overall, a great deal, and a new K&L favorite!
",Tempranillo
"Cune is one of the oldest Bodegas in Rioja, so its safe to say they make great wine.  This Crianza is awesome!  The thing that stood out most to me about his wine was the balance.  The nose had a nice ripe raspberry characteristic, and a nice aroma of earth and spice.  This is a great food wine, with medium body and great acidity.
",Tempranillo
"Spice, structure, lively acidity and fruit are jammed packed into this awesome, unbeatabley priced Crianza. It begins with a lively nose and characters of fresh blackberries and cherries then leads you into the soft spice and well integrated structure. Complex, approachable and delicious.
",Tempranillo
"For value seekers, Rioja continues to be fertile ground to find great deals at every price point. Cune Crianza has definitely become one of these values in the Rioja under $12 category. They have applied extra attention to this fairly ubiquitous (in Spain, that is) bottling  over the past 5 years, and it clearly shows in the quality of the wine. Supple, red fruited, very easy drinking, this functions perfectly as everyday house red or party wine, with the added bonus of some undeniable, unique regional style points - tough to get in such an inexpensive commercial production many other places in the world.
",Tempranillo
"An easy-going, tasty Crianza. Initial aromas of red cherries and plum, along with a bouquet of herbs, dust, and cedar. On the palate, a pleasant and lively elevated acidity, along with flavors of both dried and ripe cherries. Some plum and vanilla on the finish. A quintessential wine pairing with a plethora of various tapas choices; think Serrano ham or Manchego cheese
",Tempranillo
"This is captivating Rioja.  The nose tells you everything you want know about it.  Subtly intense, with layers and layers of fruit, both dark and red, a crazy mélange of spice and dusty earthy tones.  I'm content just to sit and nose the wine, kind of....The palate delivers everything that it promises on the nose but with super fine tannins and a long lingering finish.  This is a great wine that you will be hard pressed to hold on to, but please try, it will just get better and better.
",Tempranillo
"Now I love Prado Enea in most any vintage (of course they do not make it every year, only in the best years), but even given that context, the 2009 is truly fantastic. A wonderful year in Rioja Alta, you can truly appreciate the intensity, fruit purity, precision and outright deliciousness in this wine. Spicy/sweet aromas of blue fruits and wild mixed berry compote, a touch of cassis as well, lead to a palate of perfectly ripe fruit that also gains in freshness and minerality as it sits in the glass and you take another sip. Great wines as balanced as Prado Enea, particularly in perfectly ripe years, are really tempting and enjoyable to drink young, but certainly will repay mid to long term cellaring, so ideally you can enjoy a bottle or two now and stash away many more. Muga's Prado Enea is one of the most consistent, cellar worthy values remaining amongst the word's great wines.

"A composition of 86/14 Tempranillo/Mazuelo, this young Rioja has a long life ahead of it.  Don't get me wrong, the wine is showing exquisitely well already, but your patience will pay off if you can keep your hands off of it for another 5-8 years.  It's woody, spicy and deliciously dark fruited.  This wine has a delightfully youthful nose of coconut meat, vanilla, dark berries and black currant.  A great wine that will only get better.
",Tempranillo
"This starts out with complex aromas of cedar, tar, earth, leather and spice.  The mid-palate is dark and concentrated with layers of smoky black cherry and jammy raspberry fruit.  This thick, lively and fresh wine is still a baby and though already delicious will be much better in 5 years.
",Tempranillo
"I always have a soft spot for this wine. The first Rioja that I ever purchased to put into my cellar was the 1989.  The '07 is my favorite release since the '94.  What makes this wine stand out for me is the balance, on every level.  The aromatics carry fruit, spice, something floral and the right amount of oak.  This is not as powerfully built as some of the more recent releases, it dances on the palate with fresh dark and sour red fruits gliding over polished tannins and playing with integrated oak spice and plenty of earth.  The finish just goes and goes.  Drink it tonight but put a couple of bottles away, I'll be checking in with this wine again in about 10 years.
",Tempranillo
"Such beautifully composed wine, every facet fits perfectly in place to create a beautiful wine. Up front notes of cassis and wild cherry, coupled with damp earth and a kiss of oak richness. Giving way to a palate that strikes in impeccable balance between fruit and structure. A Supple but firm tannic structure gives the perfect frame work for fruit that is weighty without being sappy. The wood is seamlessly integrated into the wine, practically effortless. For those of you who are familiar with our direct imports, this wine fits right between the more rustic Lesmos and the more modern Merino wines.
",Tempranillo
"Elegant and refined, this Gran Reserva is like a cross between juicy modern and rustic traditional styles of Rioja, which is unusual for a normally more flashy Murrieta. Crunchy red plum, dried cherry, cassis and spice, with very nicely integrating oak- this wine is juuuuuust thinking about starting to develop the classic leathery, savory character of Gran Reserva Rioja. If you are looking for a way to explore the wines of Spain, but are not quite sure where to start, this wine would be a great buy!
",Tempranillo
"Delicate floral nose with surprisingly bright cherry through the palate and bigger berry fruit on the finish, 2007 Ygay presents a more linear style for the typically fruit-driven Murrieta.  There’s the oak and licorice that you’d expect from a Gran Reserva, but this is a leaner offering due to the colder, rainy vintage, an aspect that I think actually serves Tempranillo well.  Castillo Ygay is beautifully smooth and only gets better with air.
",Tempranillo
"This is my favorite Pruno to date. We have sold tons of earlier vintages, but it is always gratifying when the latest truly is the greatest and we can confidently opine as much!  Given the relatively cooler growing season, the 2013 Pruno has lovely aromatics, savory dark fruits with a spicy, almost leathery quality, as well as some balanced oak notes such as roast espresso and grilled bread. This is not as soft and fruit forward as the 2012; instead it has a bit more acidity, more tone. Structured and serious but very tasty to drink right now if you so choose. Lovely, expressive, and true to Ribera del Duero, this is one Pruno that you will want to drink!
",Tempranillo
"For those enamored with old-school earthy Spanish wines, or the expressive rusticity of honest wines from the Ribera del Duero, this wine is a gem! Deep, earthy forest aromas give way to dark fruit and game notes on the palate. As the wine opens up, the fruit expands and develops deeper, intricate spice notes. Truly a top-tier wine despite its playful name.
",Tempranillo
"Another fantastic bottling from our friends at Casa Juan Señor de Lesmos. Initial aromas reveal a lovely rustic charm to the wine, with a bouquet of dried herbs and dusty earth. Aromas of cherries and berries also come through as well. On the palate, flavors of dried fruits like dark cherry and berry intermingle with notes of earthy minerality. The wine's lively acidity lends it as an obvious choice for various food pairing applications. A great example of a Crianza Rioja, and a good value as well for being under $15.
",Tempranillo
"A classic, quite dry, savory expression of Crianza Rioja, the 2014 Lesmos opens with desiccated dark fruit and umami notes, with elegant wafts of anise. The palate is light and spice-dominated, with loads of dark, tart plum, cassis, a touch of iodine, and saline minerality. Though this cellar-worthy wine may need to breathe a bit, it does show nicely now. I would love to try it with grilled octopus!
",Tempranillo
"This dark-colored Ribera packs a lot of punch. Plenty of rich red fruit, earth, spices, chalk, and a soft, round mouthfeel with great texture and an even better tannin profile. Awesome.
",Tempranillo
"This is the type of bottle you bring to a party where it absolutely destroys every other wine on the table. California fans who appreciate milder Cabs, heavier Pinot Noirs, balanced Zinfandels, and silky tannins from front to back will likely fall head over heels for this lovely little Ribero del Duero. There's a reason the experts have been predicting a Spanish renaissance for years at this point: the quality-to-dollar ratio is absolutely insane (just like partying in Barcelona, you end up getting a carafe of wine, a cheese plate, and endless snacks for like nine dollars). The Monasterio is a seamless wave of absolutely gorgeous red berry fruit that creeps slowly over the palate with precision. I have to imagine the fruit will reside over time and secondary flavors will emerge, but when it tastes this good right now you'd be hard-pressed to lay off.  This is beautiful stuff. It's accessible, yet complex. Easy to like, but nuanced and layered. Like I said at the beginning, bring this to a dinner party and set your watch; they'll be oohing and ahhing in a matter of minutes.
",Tempranillo
"There is often plenty of upside to difficult vintages and this bottle is a prime example of such. I'll roll the dice any day when I know that some incredibly high quality (and generally incredibly expensive) fruit is declassified and blended into an entry-level, or estate bottling.  This wine is just seamless, showing notes of dark berries, leather and mocha.  This should age gracefully for much longer than your average Crianza.  This bottle is definitely worth a hard look but frankly, I don't expect it to be here for long.
",Tempranillo
"Never mind Napa, here's a Ribera Del Duero to sink your teeth into! This bold Tempranillo shows power and intensity from start to finish. Framed with ripe, red berry fruit and dark flavored spices, this is lush on the palate with a fine tannin finish.  What a killer steakhouse wine, that won't break the bank! Recommended!
",Tempranillo
"Impressive, the nose of this wine is a complex blend of concentrated fruit, spice and earth that reaches out to you and beckons you in. It isn’t bursting out of the glass, it’s pooling under the surface. On the palate this is a really focused, well made wine, in a bit of an “international” style but for someone like me who doesn’t like “international” style it’s not over the top. The wine is dense yet very linear, not clunky or fat. It’s a powerful, yet supple wine; tannin is evident but with its linear axis aligned the tannins elongate and balance. The finish carries through with a savory, complex fruit character, long and balanced.
",Tempranillo
"A stunning wine, the 2013 Hacienda Monasterio Ribera Del Duero knocks your socks off from the very first sniff from the glass. Loaded with seductive aromas of raspberry, rose petals and spice notes this elegant, delineated wine displays remarkable finesse and complexity. Red fruits, spice notes and cola subtly weave around a core of fine tannins and bright acidity. This wine is delightful and is the perfect match for pork, veal or lamb dishes with its bright red fruit and great balance.
",Tempranillo
"Here is an excellent addition to our Spanish offerings! The wines of Ribera del Duero are often more hefty and intense than their neighbors in Rioja, and this wine doesn't stray from the profile. However, big and bold as this wine is, it yet retains an excellent sense of balance. The dominate force here is a great sense of terroir--cool black fruit elevated by a mineral note from the soil, and accented by a kiss of French oak. You can feel the depth and character from the old vine fruit as well. The bolder side of Tempranillo is underscored and showcased very well here.
",Tempranillo
"Hacienda Solano comes from vines (many of them 80 years old) in one of the most prized vineyard towns of Ribera del Duero, La Aguilera. This fact combined with an elevage in used French barrels produces a rather dry expression of this region, marked by expressive dark fruits, limestone, and orange rind - what I often refer to as the trifecta of typical flavors for great, young Tempranillo, whether it comes from Rioja or Ribera del Duero. In Ribera, though, the structure, and tannin build of the wine sets it apart. While there is more than sufficient fruit and chalky minerality to balance out these tannins, I would not be surprised to discover a much more complete, seriously overachieving bottle of red if allowed to cellar for another several years or longer.
",Tempranillo
"You rarely come across wines that have the ability to be all things to all people. The 2010 Contino Reserva is one of those rare finds. Fruit? Absolutely - sweet, supple and incredibly pure. Savor? Yes - complex but not overwhelming flavors of earth and wood. Freshness? Without a doubt - bright acidity and mineral tones carry the day. Drink now? Happily - you will not be disappointed. Collectible? You bet - this wine is built upon vineyard pedigree that is second to none in Alavesa. Price? At $40 this is both the savvy collectors dream and a reasonable stretch for the budget conscious. Wines like this do not come around often - Enjoy!
",Tempranillo
"A superb example of the 2010 vintage. The cool vintage leaves this wine feeling super bright and fresh. The higher acidity balances out the intense dark cherry and purple fruit profile and highlights the tremendous minerality in the wine. The French and American oak regimen delivers a powder keg of spices, vanilla, cedar box, and refined tannin. It is extremely elegant and graceful, but never shy. I hope to drink this bottling for years to come because it will no doubt be a prized collectors item. Unfortunately for me, that will be a massive challenge since it's hard to not drink all of it now. I must concur with Joe's assessment that at this price, it is one of the best Rioja's I've had all year (and I just got back from a week in Rioja!).
",Tempranillo
"The 2010 vintage was widely celebrated growing season in Rioja, and the respective Contino Reserva was a great example of this. A blend of predominantly Tempranillo (85%), with a splash of Graciano (10%), and the remainder being Mazuelo and Garnacha. Classic nose of dark cherry, stewed cranberries, and plum. Some prunes as well. A juiciness on the palate, with flavors of ripe red fruit, cherry in particular. Secondary notes of old leather accompanied by a dusty minerality. This wine would be a fantastic choice with food items that have a slight gaminess to them, such as rabbit, wild boar, or morcilla (Spanish blood sausage).
",Tempranillo
"One of my all time favorite Rioja estates, Contino Reserva is always delicious: a lovely balance of ripe, forward, rich fruit, baking spices, savory tones and bright acidity. As wonderfully consistent as Contino is, it really excels in certain vintages - typically cooler years and vintages where acidities and tannins tend to be a bit higher than normal. Due to their protected, slightly warmer site, it is these vintages where Contino often produces something truly special, and 2010 is the most recent example. Aromatically a rich confit of cherries and plums, along with baking spices, leads to a palate that in  short order delivers waves of rich, intense fruit, followed by the balancing acidity which refreshes and should allow for long ageing in bottle. Perhaps there is no Rioja that will appeal to as wide a range of wine drinkers as Contino. For the price, this may be the best Spanish wines I've tasted this year.
",Tempranillo
"This 2014 Crianza primarily consists of 90% Tempranillo, with the remaining 10%  comprising of Garnacha, Graciano, and Mazuelo. The oak influence in this wine draws from multiple sources: the oak barrels used in fermentation are French Oak barrels and the barrels used in the 13-14 month aging process are American. Dominant fruit aromas of ripe blackberries and raspberries, macerated cherries, and plum. Bouquet of vanillas, balsamic, cedar, and dill. Warming spices as well, underlying. On the palate, dried berries and cherries play with a wonderful lively acidity. Tannins are there, but certainly not overwhelming. The mouthfeel and acidity lend it to being a great option with food pairings: think roast chicken and bell peppers or pork chops
",Tempranillo
"I really love this wine, an easy drinking Rioja.  Fresh red fruited and medium bodied, with nicely integrated oak, and a subtle hint of vanilla.  The palate fished with dried strawberry and a scooch of anise.  A fun party wine, great with some crudite and 80's pop music.
",Tempranillo
"A slightly richer style Rioja that starts off with a tart and direct nose but leads into a full bodied, structured wine with nice oak character integrated with blackberry and raspberries. A steal at under $15!
",Tempranillo
"Vina Real Crianza is a model of consistency: year in, year out, it is a lovely brightly fruited Rioja.  The wine always comes across with admirable freshness and poise, well integrated background barrel notes (here, in the case of the well delineated, fresh feeling 2014, they are really quite subtle) and, most importantly, drinkability for days. I go through drinking phases like anyone else, and may find a new regional rabbit hole to explore while temporarily retiring another, but I will simply never tire of  Riojas as delicious and affordable as Vina Real Crianza.
",Tempranillo
"Rioja is home to some of the most magnificent, age-worthy wines on earth, as well as many that display in their youth all the convivial charm and vibrancy that attracts the immediate consumer, the spontaneous gathering, the sitting on the deck with a good read, wines that are friendly and engaging and delicious, and so well-priced in the bargain. Such is the Alesanco, medium-bodied and oozing with flavors of red cherry, plum, savory tobacco, iron and clove, with delicate acidity on the smooth finish. A welcoming, amiable wine to open with a saffron-infused paella of poultry and chorizo.
",Tempranillo
"This beguiling wine is rich, smooth, wonderfully dry and crammed with cherry,  raspberry and dark plum fruit.  There are hints of cedar, leather, mineral and mushroom embedded in the fine grip of the long finish.  A serious and complex wine that is delicious now and has a long life ahead of it.
",Tempranillo
"The 2011 Vina Real Gran Reserva is everything I love about both older Rioja and older wine in general. It's really in a great spot for those who still like supple fruit and a fleshy mouthfeel, but want a bit of evolution and earth in their reds. There's a lovely dark fruit note that blends in seamlessly with the oak, but the wine seems more decadent than it is. It tastes expensive. It's an effortless expression and the price is great.
",Tempranillo
"This wine has it all, supple fruit, savoriness, and approachability.  This Rioja is in a great spot right now, showing supple fruit as well as soft secondary characteristics, and a balance of minerality.  This wine is a great example of why I am so drawn to the wines of the region, such elegance and finesse.
",Tempranillo
"If I could pick the perfect food wine, this one would be pretty much there. An incredible blend of fruit and savory notes lead this bottling to enhance almost anything you choose to pair it with. There is good base structure that is overlayed with deep fruits and slight minerality, which definitely makes this wine approachable now.
",Tempranillo
"The time in new French and American oak brings a beautiful richness and baking spice to this superb Rioja. A touch of Graciano in the wine adds graceful aromatics and the bit of Mazuelo brings a beautiful deep color and texture to the wine. A great vintage with mellow, integrated tannins and long lasting acidity makes this a wine easily enjoyed now with the expectation of a great tomorrow.
",Tempranillo
"The Viña Real Gran Reserva Rioja from Cvne is crafted with a balance of modernity and tradition in mind. The 2011 is a beautiful expression of that philosophy, with classic aromas of stewed raspberry, red apple skin, dill and spice, but with a pronounced minerality on the palate. A bit lighter and more energetic than you might expect from a Gran Reserva Rioja, this is an elegant, modern interpretation.
",Tempranillo
"Often times listed as ""Cune Vina Real,"" Vina Real may be under the Cune corporate umbrella, but it functions as its own independent winery (an architecturally award winning one at that) with its own unique fruit contracts in Rioja Alavesa which lend its bright, fruit forward style to the wine across the board. It is also made in  smaller quantities than the large sized production of wines such as Cune Crianza, for example. In 2011, the Vina Real GR style is one that I can best refer to as ""generosity, defined."" As in, the fruit is generous, perhaps even flirting with lush, but clearly defined by a thread of acidity that leads to a wonderfully fresh finish and points towards great drinking for years to come, or at least (conservatively) 7-8  additional years. Savory, meaty notes are only just beginning to emerge, with tell-tale notes of sweet baking spices flirting with the fruit, though ultimately it is the beautiful mixed berry fruit which carries the wine. Expect lots of deliciousness, endless pairing possibilities, and a nicely drawn out drinking window for this fairly priced, iconic Rioja.
",Tempranillo
"This wine stands out in the 2011 vintage with more liveliness and bright fruit than typically seen that growing season. An expansive nose of dark cherries, plum, and dates followed by caramel, oak barrels, and spice notes. The flavor profile on the palate evolves seamlessly with prunes, both dark and red cherries, and strawberries. Cocoa powder flavors play with silky tannins and the aforementioned elevated acidity. This wine is built for the long haul; drinking nicely now but another 4-6 years would put this in a really fun place. Pair with paella; preferably of the fennel sausage and rabbit variety!
",Tempranillo
"Defined primarily by its ripe, luscious fruit profile, this Gran Reserva deserves a decadent meal for accompaniment (perhaps duck breast with a cherry compote). Medium to fuller bodied and rather voluptuous on the palate, it reveals raspberries and cherries, buttery pie crust, cinnamon, cocoa, and a hint of leathery earth, all without ever veering to closely to sweetness.
",Tempranillo
"A great Rioja from the excellent 2010 harvest, Vivanco is an example of a winery making carefully crafted Rioja which combines the richer, more succulent fruit of a modernly styled wine, with the experience and know-how of an estate that has been at it for quite some time. A hefty chunk of Graciano (10%) seems to contribute to the darker fruit profile and overall sense of fruit purity and balance. For someone whose experience with wine is largely based on California wines and is looking to branch out into Rioja, this would be a terrific place to start. In addition to Dinastia Vivanco's winery, there is a HUGE museum of wine on the premises; you could easily spend a few hours admiring the collection of wine related exhibits, explanation of production methods, and amazing collection of pieces which the Vivanco family has acquired. The Vivanco property is located in the town of Briones, just a stone's throw away from our own direct-import producer, Miguel Merino.
",Tempranillo
"A more serious, young Ribera del Duero I have yet to taste, except for perhaps one or two fresher, more aromatic vintages of Vega Sicilia (the 1999 comes to mind) I don't draw that comparison lightly, particularly as Vega Sicilia costs upwards of $350 upon release, and of course is the original high end Spanish collectible wine. That said, if this 2013 vintage of Domninio del Aguila is any indication, I think it's not a stretch to say that this wine is every bit as good, and perhaps nearly its rival in terms of long term ageability. Time of course will tell, but I love this wine for its salted plum flavors, with a truly Castillian soil inflection and mineral backbone, alongside balanced, subtle spicy/sweet notes from the oak (35 months in oak, in fact, not quite Vega length elevage but certainly longer than the normal these days).  I encourage anyone  - Vega Sicilia collector or simply Spanish wine fan - to check out this fantastic new Ribera del Duero producer.
",Tempranillo
"From the provincia of Burgos, the largest of the sub-zones of Ribera del Duero, Condado de Haza is Pesquera's sister winery and wine. This 2014 vintage shows great delineation and freshness, with aromas of pomegranates and freshly cracked peanut shells. On the palate it is red fruited, perhaps a bit edgier and more tense than usual, but sure to open up with a decant, and likely to continue improving for some time. Very good Ribera del Duero.
",Tempranillo
"Often, our wine reviews will lead with the value proposition at hand: an extremely limited production, terrific value for money, the complexity of aromas and flavors. In this case, I find it necessary to open with  an introduction of one of the more towering personalities in the wine world (or in any world, for that matter) I have ever met: Ezequiel ""El Brujo"" García. El Brujo studied with the great Bordeaux oenologist, Emile Peynaud. He made the incredible Cune wines of the 1960's. He was responsible for fine tuning Cune's Monopole white, a wine which absolutely dominated in its day (and a style which has become fashionable once again). He also became a friend of mine later in his life, someone who would enthusiastically discuss Rioja history, his experience informally advising wineries (amongst them, Lopez de Heredia), and really anything related to the region's local traditions and culture of wine. I love the name of this Rioja, Los Autores, because it was crafted by a true auteur. Ezequiel drew the image on the bottom right hand side of the label. He had an intimate understanding of the vineyards which would form the blend, as well as an idea of what proportion of the various grape varieties should be involved (typical of El Brujo's wines, there are important components of Mazuelo, Garnacha, and even white Viura grapes included).  Finally, Ezequiel also selected the well seasoned, 8-10 year old barrels that the wine would age in for 36 months.  Now to the wine: how does it taste? It's old school, light on its feet, history in a bottle.  2011 is a generous vintage if you're drinking it now, capable of early consumption, though this wine will undoubtedly reward cellaring. It reminds me of Tondonia, with its understated dark fruit, soft texture, and incredibly easy to drink profile.  Sadly, this is the last wine that Ezequiel ""El Brujo"" would ever blend as he passed away last August. I would encourage you to stash some bottles away, being sure to enjoy at least one of them now and toast to the legend of ""El Brujo.""
",Tempranillo
"Coming to us from the late, great winemaker Ezequiel “El Brujo” Garcia, formerly of Cune Bodega, the 2011 Los Autores is beautifully integrated and developed, ready to sing. With a complex bouquet of subtle vanilla, sweet hoisin and dill, stewed and dried cranberry and raspberry, dried rose petal and strawberry seed, this wine energetically expands on the palate. With bright acidity, soft, dusty tannins and slightly briny persistent minerality, nothing is out of balance.
",Tempranillo
"A quintessentially classic Rioja. This wine holds the name El Brujo, which roughly translates to ""the wizard."" This was the nickname bestowed upon winemaker Ezequiel García, who made the legendary CVNE Riojas of the 1950's-1970's. This 2011 Reserva was selected by García from top vineyards in both Rioja Alavesa and Rioja Alta. The aging process was performed in the traditional manner (3 years of aging prior to release, with at least 1 year of aging in oak barrels). The wine leads initially with aromas of dill and vanilla. A bouquet of cocoa powder along with notes of fresh cherries, berries, and plum also reveal themselves. A distinct dusty minerality shines on the palate along with elevated acidity, and flavors once more of plum; some cherry coulis, leather, and savory notes too. Quite nicely balanced. A fantastic wine; especially as an accompaniment to food.
",Tempranillo
"This wine is simply gorgeous! Great snappy fruit with cranberries and cherries, spices that translates to great persistence and length in the follow through for such an aged Rioja. Oh, and the well seasoned tannin structure is what you can only get with time in the bottle. The perfect holiday wine.
",Tempranillo
"Powerful, yet without any avoirdupois, this is a terrific example of a Gran Riserva Rioja at a very reasonable price. While the fruit is softened and transformed by virtue of the lengthy barrel & bottle aging, it still has integrity and is identifiable as such, taking its place along with the leathery-earthy-spicy aspects, rather than being subsumed within them. For those of you who like aged wine, but lack the patience or the space to mature bottles yourself, this is easily one of our best bets, and bears consideration alongside our older, direct buy Bordeaux.
",Tempranillo
"This is a fabulous, classic, old school Rioja. I opened it last night to enjoy on it's own and the intensity of the dark cherry fruit after 17 years was incredible. It really has a lovely primary fruit that blends seamlessly into the more developed flavor profile of leather, spice, and tobacco. The American oak has also integrated beautifully. This is an exceptionally graceful example of aged Rioja, and without breaking the bank too! It is so good now, but will certainly reward continued patience and cellaring as well.
",Tempranillo
"If you're looking for a Rioja with some age on it, you won't do much better than this bottle for the price. The earthy, dark fruit profile makes this a big, rich wine. That being said, the acidity and long finish make it distinctly Spanish. Fantastic wine!
",Tempranillo
"Classic Rioja and so much age for the price. Inky and interesting with a casky elegance, Lesmos shows dark cherry fruit balanced with easy minerality.Also makes a great gift: Spanish wine fans may happily recognize the traditional style and quality, and the velvety richness should impress Bordeaux and Napa Cab devotees (who might even think you spent a lot more).  A winner.
",Tempranillo
"Sultry only begins to describe this exquisite wine from Lesmos.  Showing mulled raspberry and strawberry fruit on the nose, it quickly evolves into notes of leather (like really good expensive leather) and grilled chorizo.  Beautiful spice and chalky notes round out the flavors.  I've tasted the '98 several times and it has always impressed.  This should continue to evolve for years to come but what an impressive wine it is right now.
",Tempranillo
"This Gran Reserva Rioja is great wine, and an unbelievable value for the quality. Cinnamon and I had this Bodegas Casa Juan Senor De Lesmos last night with thick cut pork chops and Spanish rice and were blown away by its class and intensity. This Rioja was one of the most concentrated and intense old school wines I have ever had. Rather than being blown away by oak, we were treated to intense savory red fruit and a laser finish that flattered the meal to no end. It held up to the spice in the rice with no problem and is on my list to buy today!
",Tempranillo
"This is a gorgeous wine! Moving gracefully into its secondary characteristics, with stewed cherry, hints of leather and earth. Still had medium plus acid and fine tannins, leading me to believe this puppy will continue to age well for at least another 5-10 years. Drink it now after decanting, and you will not be diasppointed!
",Tempranillo
"Funny, when I saw this wine's stark black and white label my brain ran through reels of old Japanese monster films from the 1950s, those fabulous Toho Production classics like Rodan vs. Gamera or Ganko Fights Godzilla. OK, I know ""Ganko"" didn't really fight Godzilla, but it turns out the word means ""stubborn,"" a nickname that winemaker Olivier Riviere acquired from his clever Japanese importer. Olivier inhabits his own skin, and like Ghidra or Godzilla, is not one to waver, but fortunately his singular Rioja wines are anything but abrasive or indelicate. Grown at altitude on very old vines, the result is a wine of veritas and virtue, brimful of lustrous, high toned fruit--pomegranates, red berries, minerals and lovely potpourri spice. Hardly a kaiju behemoth, but all the better for that! And yes, the ending is guaranteed not to disappoint. Astonishing performance from a cast, er, bottle of one...
",Tempranillo
"Truly a remarkable and unique Rioja that deserves your attention. Especially if you're up for trying something unexpected and wonderful. Ultra bright and fresh, this Rioja is made up of Granacha and Mazuelo, but not a drop of Tempranillo. It has incredible aromatics and a lively floral quality that you are more likely to find in Burgundy or the Willamette Valley. The acid is tremendously refreshing, but balanced perfectly with the ripe red fruits. The tannins are fine and the finish long. This is a special wine that is extremely versatile in food pairings from light fish to hearty chorizo paella and some of your favorite vegetable dishes to boot.
",Tempranillo
"The Ganko is made up of a an equal bend of Mazuelo and Garnacha.  As much as I adore the Tempranillo based Rioja that I am used to drinking, I was super excited to taste such a different expression of Rioja.  These old vine grapes grow in the high elevation, this allows for them to ripen slowly.  This wine has a beautiful nose, black fruits, mocha, dried violets, and exotic spices.  It has great acidity, and nice structure.  I think it would drink nicely with chorizo or other charcuterie, it would also do well to rest in the bottle for a while and drink on a special occasion.
",Tempranillo
"""Pretty"" is a descriptive term I use, and know I should refrain from, but when I come across a wine like Olivier Riviere's Ganko, it's one of the first things that comes to mind.  Aromatic, bright, lifted red fruit, fresh, herbaceous...just pretty.  It's elegant, light and delicate but still carries some structure.  It's refined and drinks just like the 1er Cru village Rioja Olivier considers this to be.
",Tempranillo
"Original, category defying wines are difficult to place. This is definitely the case for the most distinctive Spanish red I have tasted year to date, the 2014 Olivier Riviere ""Ganko."" Unlike our other featured Riojas, this one has no tempranillo whatsoever, instead consisting of Garnacha and Mazuelo grown in high elevation vineyards, kind of way out in the sticks on the southern, Sierra de la Demanda side of Rioja Alta. Olivier brings his Beaune training and French sensibility to this wine, which comes across as incredibly bright and perfumed, fresh and high toned but structured and serious as well. In a wine world where Barbaresco meets a fresher style of southern Rhone wine, you will find this wholly original, subtly spicy, intense, freshly fruited Rioja. It is beautiful now, though likely to improve for at least another 7-8 years. For the Rioja completist or simply anyone who is curious, I think you will find a lot to like in this beauty. Highly recommended.
",Tempranillo
"Does slightly peppery, fresh and dark fruited Tempranillo hold some appeal for you? How about one bottled in a one liter bottle, for maximum bang for buck? For value red seekers, whether or not you veer towards Spain, this is absolutely a delicious Tempranillo to try.
",Tempranillo
"Founded in 1890 by five families of deeply passionate wine growers, La Rioja Alta is one of the most iconic bodegas of Rioja, and its delicate, exquisite wines rarely fail to captivate and enthrall. Situated in the historic town of Haro with neighbors that include Bodegas Muga and López Heredia, this winery has maintained strong traditional roots while implementing new technology when necessary to enhance quality. The 2000 Viña Ardanza Reserva is a classic rendition, having spent up to three years in older oak barrels before release. The result? A prismatically elegant, perfectly-aged wine redolent of cured tobacco, crushed raspberries and sweet spice, achieving an ideal balance between fruit and acidity. Complex, layered and superbly nuanced, the Ardanza will dictate what to serve with it, not the other way around, although I might suggest a pork tenderloin.

"A wonderful offering from La Rioja Alta, this reserva is NOT to be missed!  Driven by complex notes of dried red fruit, baking spices, tobacco and cedar, this rioja possesses excellent balance and acidity.  This is the perfect match for your favorite rustic cuisine!
",Tempranillo
"The addition of a good dose of Garnacha in the Vina Ardanza adds structure and depth, and makes for a wine with a more prominent and darker fruit profile than their Vina Alberdi, which is traditionally 100% Tempranillo. The nose reveals a complex bouquet of fruit and spice aromas interlaced with the more developed, savory aromas that I have come to love about good Rioja with some bottle age. Though mature now, still-ripe flavors of raspberry and blackberry support the developing dried fruit, caramelized nuts, and earthy flavors on the palate.  This is a wine that is perfect to enjoy now, but the firm tannins and long finish indicate that it will continue to evolve for a few more years in bottle.
",Tempranillo
"From the Arribes D.O., which is basically the far western extreme of the Spanish portion of the Duero River valley before you hit the border with Portugal and enter the Douro Superior sub-zone, comes this delicious new arrival from Alvar de Dios. Aromas are pungent, mineral, just slightly reductive and redolent of red fruits as well as (and I'm quoting two of my colleagues here because I think it's right on the money) jackfruit and peach. Intense flavors are driven in equal parts by minerality, fruit, acidity and tannins. A delicious wine to expand your Spanish wine range.
",Tempranillo
"Muga is one of the quintessential Rioja producers and this 2011 dishes up classic Tempranillo flavor in a style that should appeal to just about anyone. The balance of fruit, earth, fine tannins, and cocoa remind me of all the flavors I love in Cabernet as well, making the Muga a potential crossover Spanish option for California or Bordeaux lovers who want to try something new. You'll be impressed.
",Tempranillo
"This Muga offers up an incredible richness and expression and is in my opinion one of the best Riojas in the store. The palate and rich and fruity while the oak adds structure and depth to help round out the wine. The fruit is juicy and deep and is highlighted by some bright acidity that helps balance tannins. This wine has some great weight, not too ripe or grippy, but eloquent and striking. Don't miss this.
",Tempranillo
"I have a new obsession with Riojas and this Muga is bringing me in deeper. The  prominent nose is filled with fresh red fruit, baking spice and dry earth. The smooth but impactful structure is elongated on the side palate with flavors that match the nose. A mix of dried herbs and deep, engulfing fruit adds a vivid strength to the finish. This is a gorgeous food wine that is easily enjoyed now!
",Tempranillo
"Deeply concentrated nose of dark cherries, boysenberries, cedar, and stone. The palate is expansive, both bright and complex. It shows layered notes of cola, cherry, blueberry, mocha, cedar box, tremendous minerality and length. The finish is dry, with slightly dusty tannin but lengthy. It definitely leaves you wanting another sip, and perhaps a bite of a succulent roast. If you're not familiar with the incredible value that Muga has to offer - this is the place to start. This is a hugely versatile wine that would make a great cocktail party or complement your favorite meal - not to mention convert all your friends to Spanish wine lovers.
",Tempranillo
"When I think back to the first great red wines I tasted in my early twenties - the wines that would ultimately shape my palate and send me into the wine business - the reserva Riojas from Muga might have been the most influential. Not only were the flavors rich, robust, textural, and complex, they were within reach of my limit budget back then. There was no way I could ever splurge on a $150 bottle with my elementary school teacher salary at the time, but I did find a way to scrape together thirty bucks or so for the Muga, a wine that I think represents the essence of what makes Spanish reds so attractive: their quality-to-value ratio. The 2011 Especial Reserve is the best of two worlds, in my opinion. It has fine tannins, a bit of earth, and a rusticity that should please Bordeaux lovers, but it has lush fruit, hints of oak, and a fleshiness that should appeal to those who like riper California reds. More importantly, it's a wine that extends over the party lines and unites all drinkers under one umbrella. I'd be hard-pressed to find a cab or merlot lover who didn't enjoy immensely the character of the tempranillo-dominated Muga. It's so versatile and friendly in so many ways. The point, however, is that I think Muga is a gateway wine. It's a wine that expands horizons and opens doors to exciting new worlds. Without Muga, I never would have found my way to K&L, that's for sure.

"We are excited to have two fully mature, extremely affordable examples of Reserva Rioja from the esteemed Martinez Lacuesta in their 1987 and 1991 bottlings. I suspect that everyone will have their favorite, as this 1991 is quite tasty though distinct from the '87. Aromas initially were a combination of leateher and leather conditioner, though after opening up they became meatier, less leathery, and the palate rounded out and became less taut and tangy. While I maintain that this '91 shows more evolution than the older 1987, a co-worker just mentioned that they prefer it. Either way, a fully mature bottle of Rioja from a very good vintage is never a bad thing! Particularly if there happens to be a grilled ribeye served alongside it....
",Tempranillo
"An inviting Rioja that is easily one of best values in the respective category. Ripe plum and berries are at the forefront of this wine’s aroma profile, but not overly so. Leather and baking spices also come through. On the palate, flavors of prunes, blackberries, and vanilla give way to dry tannins and an elevated acidity. Quite food friendly; will go well with charcuterie and various stewed meats. A prime example of the modern-classic style of Rioja
",Tempranillo
"Vitola may be Miguel Merino's most affordable wine - a reserva bottling, at that - but here affordability is not to be conflated with ""simple"" or ""entry level"" as this is a serious bottle of wine. Primarily Tempranillo from 40+ year-old vineyards in the prime Rioja Alta village of Briones form the basis of this structured, yet fresh and limestone laden medium to full bodied red. Aged for 22 months in barrels with American oak staves combined with French tops and bottoms, Vitola is a great introduction to the wonderfully tasty Riojas of this boutique Rioja Alta bodega. Buy some to drink now and some additional bottles to cellar for up to another (conservative window, here) 7-8 years.
",Tempranillo
"This is a beauty of a Rioja from a vintage rated unanimously ""excellent"" by the Control Board. With a deep garnet hue that verges on black, this wine has wonderful clarity. Classic aromas of fresh dill and ripe and dried plum hit you first, while raspberry preserves and red apple follow in a complex trail. The palate is expansive and powerful, but with a soft, integrated tannin and very well balanced acidity. Lush, with ripe and tart fruit notes, the wine finishes on a spicy, lingering peppery note.
",Tempranillo
"Nicely showing very pretty oak and brambly fruit with fine grained tannins, this is an amazing bargain.  Purely Rioja, but with a modern twist.  Grill up some lamb chops and open this for a fantastic dinner!
",Tempranillo
"This is a lot of wine for this price. It has an expressive nose  that is layered and inviting. In the mouth this complexity continues with full bodied dark fruit flavors that are dry and complex. There is a subtle hint of earthiness. This will go great with hearty foods.

"A blend of 50% Tempranillo and 50% Garnacha from trusted vineyard sources, this is Rioja with the Bryan MacDonald treatment! Turns out that ends up delivering you an amazingly fresh, red fruited wine with great cut, purity and poise. This tastes like no other young Rioja I have ever tried, and yet even as a Rioja fanatic (ok - at times, purist) I want more. How does Bryan Mac D do it? While it obviously starts in the vineyard with terrific sources, I also think that Bryan approaches wine making rather differently from most of his colleagues in Rioja. The result is a wine that you must try, regardless of whether or not Rioja is your thing. Super tasty and interesting wine, a real eye opener!
",Tempranillo
"Bodegas Riojanas makes fine, traditionally styled Riojas, and it is the Monte Real which is their more limited bottling, particularly in vintages where they produce a Gran Reserva. Tempranillo, Mazuelo and Graciano from  vineyard land located near their Cenicero winery, this wine shows all of the wonderful fruit purity and acid cut of the 08 vintage, with the sweetly savory, developing complexity appropriate for a Rioja nearing the 10 year mark. Drink it now or age it a while longer, either way you are in for a real treat.
",Tempranillo
"In 1994, Miguel Merino made his inaugural Rioja wine, a Reserva. To this day, the Reserva is  the most important, and at a modest 7,000 total bottles, his largest production wine. I love this 2011: it is every bit as richly fruited, sweetly spicy and delicious as usual, and I find the oak at this early stage to be nicely integrated into the wine. Tasting this, I am reminded of what drew Miguel to the beautiful village and vineyards of Briones (it wasn't merely the pretty scenery!) Black cherry, blackberry confit, dried orange peel, and underlying baking spices combine in this delicious Rioja. While this will age gracefully, there is no reason to wait as it is showing beautifully now. A perennially under the radar gem of a wine that we are happy to have on hand for those who know their Rioja.
",Tempranillo
"My personal favorite Miguel Merino wine I’ve had the pleasure of tasting thus far. A blend of 96% Tempranillo and 4% Graciano, this wine is layered with notes of dark cherry compote, fresh berries, baked plum, bourbon vanilla, and bread pudding. On the palate, crunchy dark fruit flavors are accented with spice notes and vanilla once more. Slight hint of blood orange additionally. What makes this wine truly stand out from others is its silky tannins and structural balance. Drinking well now, but will age gracefully for another 10 years. Pair with Iberian ham or Manchego cheese
",Tempranillo
"The 2011 Reserva is forward and vibrant while also offering dark rich black cherry  fruit with spice box and beautifully integrated oak in a lovely modern and enticing style.  There is a lot of brightness here, but a great backbone to hold this wine up for ageing also.
",Tempranillo
"This excellent, and affordable, Rioja gives the best of both worlds. It has New World juiciness and brightness, with Old World spice and (subtle) tannin for complexity. Bright red fruits with bright acidity makes this wine a winner for nearly every meal. At this price, why not buy a case?
",Tempranillo
"Like a fighter that punches way above his/her weight class, this is pound for pound one of the best wines in the store. The ripe red fruit is supported by a mineral backbone and plenty of spice. There's plenty of body here, but the snappy, lip-smacking acidity on the finish is classic Rioja! Drink up!
",Tempranillo
"One of our best deals in Spain. Medium bodied with dark red fruits accented with spicy oak and earth, a classic Rioja.  Where this wine stands out is the intensity of its flavors, it has the persistence and depth of a wine more than twice its price.

"What has become some of my two favorite Rioja producers are Bodegas Puelles and the productions from this fabulous house, Bodegas Casa Juan Senor de Lesmos, which are DI's for us.  Medium deep ruby in color, this 2009 Gem offers a traditional style nose of cedar, an antiqueish tone, and red fruit driven aromas. In the mouth, it is balanced, complex, integrated, broad, and deeply flavored. It is a truly wonderful wine at a very reasonable price. Rusty has informed me that I need to bring home at least several cases of this Gem soon, and you need to do so, too. ***** 13.0% ABV *****
",Tempranillo
"We love this Rioja. As one of our favorite direct imports, it pulls off the mean feat of delivering great typicity for it's region, as well as presenting something unique, a different angle on a landscape of wines we thought we had known fairly well prior to finding these folks. Perhaps its the 15% Mazuelo, the particular organic sites in Laguardia and Villabuena de Alava (we are talking about vineyards in great equilibrium, with no need to even add any organic compost), or Angel's exacting winemaking. It all adds up to delicious wine that drinks beautifully now, as it will continue to for years to come.
",Tempranillo
"It's almost embarrassing how many excellent deals in Spanish wine there are right now. Sometimes it can be hard to cut through the noise, but this traditionally-styled 2009 Rioja from Lesmos is a cut above, and for only 12.99, an easy choice to make for almost any occasion. Bright red fruits with tea leaves, baking spice, and tomato give the palate a complex but fresh appeal. The acidity is integrated and consistent, making this a great pairing with anything from pork medallions to Spanish ""gambas al ajillo"" (garlic shrimp).
",Tempranillo
"Classy, elegant OLD SCHOOL Rioja! The ""904"" references the year that La Rioja Alata purchased Bodegas Ardanza (1904). Soft, velvety texture gently glides across your palate, with tons of pure dark berry fruit and gentle spice.  It's very drinkable now (try with a rack of lamb), or age it for another 10 years for a truly properly aged treat.
",Tempranillo
"Valbuena is not a second wine. It is in fact a vineyard selection from Vega Sicilia's property, one that features some of the best Tempranillo in all the world, farmed meticulously on their estate vineyards, first planned and planted in the latter half of the 19th century. Like Vega Secilia, this wine manages to blend powerful dark fruits with fresh acidity and surprising finesse. It is also able to be cellared for a long time; a few years ago we tasted the 1987 and it was fantastic.

"A longtime participant in the wine business, having sold wine for wine distributors in the States as well as working as an export manager, Miguel has found success along every step of the way, and then decided that rather than retire, he wanted to fulfill his dream of owning vines and making wine. Based in the Rioja Alta town of Briones, Miguel Merino makes, as he likes to put it, an ""updated classic"" style of Rioja, all from his own 2 hectares of vines and several hectares of vineyards owned by a close friend. All the fruit is from sloped vineyards (Miguel is a fan of his slopes) within the cooler climate Rioja Alta town of Briones, which makes these wine a terrific showcase of the terroir (especially in a region where wines blended from various villages are more often the norm). This Gran Reserva is from some of their oldest Tempranillo and Graciano vines, planted in 1931 and 1946.

"Still a baby by most standards.  Great extraction and full of complexity, this has rich blackberry fruit, spice box and celeriac notes.  The wine goes on and on but a few more years wouldn't hurt.
",Tempranillo
"Composed of all Tempranillo from Cenicero (Rioja Alta), this wine shows great fruit purity, intensity and poise, with just a hint of a leathery quality emerging but ultimately a wine where the fruit is a bit more at the fore than their current release Gran Reserva bottling of Monte Real. For $25 this traditionally styled Rioja Reserva is about as solid as it gets.
",Tempranillo
"Quite a pretty nose; highlights include prunes, blue fruit, dried currants, and leather. On the palate, prune flavors appear again along with dried dark cherries, dried blueberries, and cocoa dusted chocolate truffles. A classic Gran Reserva, though on the younger side currently. An ideal candidate to add to the wine cellar. This wine can be enjoyed as a food pairing option with roast chicken or pork tenderloin. Decant for at least 30 minutes before serving
",Tempranillo
"Merino's two oldest vineyards of Tempranillo and Graciano are included in this Gran Reserva - in my mind the most age-worthy of Miguel's stable. Initially somewhat reticent, the spicy oak and dark fruit confit - with rich, dried fruit aromas also present - give way to a palate that opens nicely with air. Plum and blue skinned fruit flavors continue to gain in freshness in this young Gran Reserva. You can enjoy now with a nice decant, though for my money this is as solid a 10+ year cellar candidate Rioja as you will find, particularly for fans of fruit and more richly styled wines from this region.
",Tempranillo
"Miguel Merino's Grand Reserva 2009 offers the best of classic Rioja and modern.  Absolutely lovely rich fruit still showing plenty of youth with a warm creamy cocoa underlay.  The tannins are smooth and long, luring you into drinking right away but some time in the cellar will truly reward you.  Produced from his 2 oldest vineyard sources, the quality of the original fruit is very apparent and 2009 blessed us with a wonderful vintage.
",Tempranillo
"The fruit sources in this wine from Miguel Merino are from vines up to 80 years old. It also uses exclusively French Oak (around 40% new), being one of the only wines in their portfolio to do so. A nicely layered nose of dark fruits, plum sauce, vanilla, cedar, and a touch of soy. Texturally, this wine shines. It possesses richness but is complemented by lively acidity. Long finish. While drinking well now, this wine will only get better with age. I recommend holding this for at least another 3-5 years
",Tempranillo
"Take fruit from Miguel Merino's two oldest vineyards (planted in 1931 and 1946), hand harvest, sort and ferment as normal, and then rack to exclusively French oak barrels, a portion of which are new, and leave the rest to the winery's heir apparent, Miguel's son (also Miguel), and you have Unnum. It's a big wine, more deeply pitched than the Gran Reserva, and in some ways more tightly structured. It is a lot of wine, capable of improving nicely in bottle. One of the more fascinating wine ageing experiments I plan to conduct involves ageing the same vintages of Miguel Merino Gran Reserva and Unnum, and seeing where they are at 10, 15, 25 years old.  Same vineyards, different barrel and bottle ageing. I will have to report back once the results are in....

"The 2017 fall releases from Ridge have dropped and they are just as we'd expect from the famous Zinfandel producer - fabulous! Lytton Springs, situated in the Dry Creek Valley, is always an incredibly approachable, elegant Zinfandel that is a great introduction to Ridge. It is not overwhelmed by new oak (only 15% is new) and is layered with dried herbs, oak spice and black fruits. This iconic wine will only get better as time goes on, but don't be afraid to enjoy now!
",Zinfandel
"The Ridge ""Lytton Springs"" has always been the Zinfandel to give to people who say they don't like Zinfandel. It's one of the most elegant, poised, and serious red blends made in the entire state and the 2015 takes that complex and layered formula to an entirely new level. More like a Bordeaux blend than a classic Zin, the addition of 16% Petite Syrah adds serious grit and structure, but it's brilliantly done and bolsters the richness of the fruit beautifully. When you start to think about what goes into crafting a great wine, not just the quality of the fruit or the location of the vineyard, but also the blending of different varietals to make something greater than the sum of its parts, the Lytton Springs is high on my list of iconic blends. As you decant the 2015 vintage, you'll notice more and more complexity as the air unlocks all that intrigue: berries, spice, brush, earth, excitement!
",Zinfandel
"This wine is pure class from the first sniff. The elegance, polish and purity that this wine possesses belies it's rugged old vine source. This wine has so much elegance, refinement and poise. Often when we think about ""Old Vine Zin"" it conjures up ideas of massive dark fruit, wildness...and sense of untamed raw material. This wine has all the concentration and intensity one might hope for but it presents itself so immaculately. The lifted, brambly fruits delineated from the Asian spice, leather, earth. The underlying tannin structure (from the Petite Sirah) is formidable but fine grained and beautifully wrapped with the wines flowing medium bodied fruit. The mid-palate has a generosity and softness but the wine also has a linear shape on the palate and beautiful length. This is just incredible wine and a serious bargain when you consider its pedigree and proven longevity.

"The latest offering from Ridge ""Lytton Springs"" Zinfandel is one of my favorites I have tried this year. A blend of 74% Zinfandel, 16% Petite Sirah, 8% Carignan and 2% Mataro (Mourvedre). Fresh blackberries and cherries are accentuated by rich vanilla and a dash of pepper. Nicely integrated tannin and acid give this Zinfandel balance and focus. Soft minerality and a touch of licorice, and fig add to the finish of this polished classic.

"Planted before the turn of the last century by the original owners, the d’Agostini family, this old, head-pruned vineyard sits at an elevation site in the Sierra foothills that is one of highest in California (bordering 3000 feet). Yet, it consistently produces one of the riches, most complete and complex Zins to be found domestically, and at an unheard of ridiculously low price. I thought that the 2014 was one of most complete, definitive Zins to come from this estate and that it would be near impossible to duplicate its overall quality; that is, until this 2015 'Rocky Top' showed up at our door. Medium-deep ruby in color, the opulent, magnificent bouquet of blackberry, currants, violets, white pepper, and anise with undertones of cedar, mocha, and lava earthiness minerality, is profoundly distinctive and room-filling set of aromas. In its rich, lush, viscous, well-structured, yet elegant and balanced palate presentation, you will be treated to a complex, silky, round and totally assimilated Zin that has a long, warm, flashy finish. Regardless of price, this remarkable Zinfandel Gem is one of the best available on market, and Rusty and I plan to bring home cases of it for our consumption over the next three to five years. One final quick note: I was lucky enough to get a half of a ton of grapes for two years running, from this vineyard from Leon Sobon in the mid-1990s that, in both years, made some of the best wines that I have ever created. AN AMAZING VALUE - ENJOY!!! ***** 14.5% ABV *****

"This wine is a great option for weekday dinners. This medium bodied wine offers soft tannins and balanced fruit. I've enjoyed a glass with pizza, bbq, pork dishes or all on its own after a long day at work. It's hard to believe you're getting a special reserve Zin for only 9.99. You'll be glad you did!

"Not surprising that Banshee, the Sonoma winery that takes its name from a mythical Irish demon, would name one of its deadly delicious wines after a voracious raven of Scandinavian folklore. And this Zinfandel, crafted from ancient dry-farmed vines, is something of a throwback style, before so many Zins became synonymous with something you spread on an English muffin! There is of course an array of delicious fruit: blackberry and red raspberry flavors, complemented by refined notes of licorice, graphite and spice. A superbly wrought Zinfandel to charm and enthrall your own ravenous palate....

"""Old vine"" is one of those terms you see on wine bottles that I'm not sure everyone understands, but nevertheless is used as a marketing tool by wineries to tout the quality of their hooch. It's kind of like ""small batch"" for Bourbon in that it implies something special or unique, but there's no real regulation regarding either term; it's really up to the integrity of the producer when it comes to the usage. What's so special about old vines then? It depends on which winemaker you talk to (as it can be a controversial subject), but old vines often give more concentrated fruit and a better sense of place when it comes to terroir, as the root networks extend deep into the soil, criss-crossing like veins through the heart of their terrain. Some winemakers say that old vines have a better ability to cope with diverse weather conditions because of their life experience—they have wisdom, so to speak. With every vintage, they gain a better understanding of their environment; plus, there's a reason they're still around after decades and decades, right? Someone must think they're pretty special to have left them in place for so long, while other vineyards get ripped up, replaced, and replanted. 2015 Valravn Old Vine Zinfandel: a wine that really impresses. It's made by the same team behind the Banshee project, focusing on 50 to 105 year old bush-pruned vines in Sonoma County that are all hand-harvested to preserve the varietal's full glory. What you get is concentrated red berry flavors, rich and juicy on the palate, but accented with savory spices, brush, and licorice-like peppery notes.

"The one wine that you’re most likely to find from Bedrock, as all of the wines are quite limited in production, is the “Old Vine” Zinfandel. Made from a selection of historic vineyards from throughout California, averaging over 80 years old and coming from some of the biggest and best names in Zinfandel,  this is not only one of the best Zinfandel values on the market but one of the best values period in the world of California wine. Lustily fruited this intertwines both higher toned red fruits and lower toned black fruits on the nose along with exotic spice notes of Szechwan pepper and star anise. Fully weighted but with soft and flexible tannins and a velvety mouthfeel this is a rare find in the world Zin. Wild berries, 72% dark chocolate, cherry coulis, ground white pepper and a finishing flair of black cardamom all combine for one tremendous and very affordable Zin.

"Bedrock is one of my all-time favorite Zin producers in the world, on par with Ridge for my top spot. Winemaker Morgan is an absolute genius and one of the best winemakers in the US. What I love and find unique about his wines is his search for old, forgotten, decrepit vineyards that he finds and revitalizes and turns into the beautiful wines under his Bedrock label. There is no better example of that than in this ""Old Vine"" offering combining some of the best Zinfandel vineyards in California. Everything I look for in a great wine is present here: bright acidity, rich, balanced fruit, and complex minerality for balance.

Pagani Ranch contains some of the oldest vines dating back to the 1880's and Ridge has been sourcing from them since 1991. The 2015 blend consists of mostly Zinfandel, with Alicante Bouschet and Petite Sirah adding color, fullness and dark elements to the wine.

The palate is packed with similar flavors, full-bodied and very fruit forward but with beautifully judged extraction. Sure the flavors are ripe (it's from one of the warmest, earliest harvests in living memory) but there is delicious freshness and vibrancy to the wine. Nothing about it's fruit profile stewed or roasted. People are going to love this wine from the get go...it's the perfect essence of Zinfandel.

"While the 2015 Lytton Springs is more a more structured and nuanced wine, the Pagani Ranch is the real crowd pleaser. It's so soft and loaded with sweet cassis fruit right off the bat with hints of violet on the finish and a texture that's like velvet on the tongue. I'm far from what you'd consider a big, rich California wine lover, but as a professional I like anything that's well made. I really enjoyed this wine, from its immediate charm and juicy character to its plush mouthfeel and seductive sweetness.

"I first got to taste this little gem with Scot and the other Bilbro brothers (Jake and Sam) at the winery and instantly fell in love with it. It was Zin but it was Zin with a twist. There was the beautiful upfront dried raspberry and wild blackberry with clean crushed bramble and savory spice, but there was a subtle elegance rarely seen in a young Zin. I tasted it again when I opened it for the staff a while later and fell in love with it in a whole new way. There was so much potential to this unassuming Zinfandel, Petit Sirah & Carignan blend. Along with the wild berry notes were now aromatics of honeycomb, rose petals and fresh golden raisins along with some clean scorched earth. I was automatically transported to Bordeaux and couldn't believe how an old school field blend could be so reminiscent of such an esteemed wine region. Enjoy this beautiful little blend now for a sophisticated and beautiful blend that would pair with any Springtime fair, or squirrel one away for a few years and be pleased with the brilliant choice you made to actually age an Zin-based blend!

"The Marietta Old Vine Lot Blends have always been some of my favorite daily drinkers from California.  The briary spicy nature captures the essence of the olden days when a Zinfandel field blend was a fun and financially sound way to enjoy good wine every day.   Let's take that up a few notches now with the ""Angeli.""  Still the essence of spicy brambly fruit, the wine exudes much more richness and polish than the Old Vine.  Now competing with the likes of the Prisoner, Robert Biale and Carlisle but at half the price, this wine is long and persistent on the palate but shows more of the lifted and less balmy qualities of a wine this densely packed.  Enjoy with the heartiest of summer dishes but probably best with some slow smoked sausage or those meats right off the grill.

"Almost never has such an unexpected blend delivered such a classic flavor profile. The components are Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, and Carignan, but it drinks like young Bordeaux, despite the absence of all Bordeaux varietals. This guy is big and rich, but never over-the-top, showing raisins, cassis, fig, toast, and rounded out by dried flowers and savory herbals that linger on through the finish. A great, off-the-beaten-path candidate for your cellar (5-7 more years ought to do it).

"The Roman from Marietta is one of my favorite Zinfandels in the store. This bottle has what all zin should have, plenty of wild brambly fruit and excellent balancing acidity. I can't wait to pair this with a big rack of pork ribs smoked in the backyard or even sausages cooked over the campfire. If you love zin, but can do without monstrous alcohol and residual sugar, this is a must try!
",Zinfandel
"Very bright, clean and juicy with tons of mixed berries and spice in the middle.  this is pure, fresh and savory with meaty notes on the long, focused finish.  This middleweight wine tastes the way Zin use to taste before the invasion of new oak barrels.  Lip smacking, mouthwatering and palate cleansing.

"Zinfandel that is done in a classic, “not over-the-top” style is hard to find these days. The Dashe is just lovely. Lots of red fruits flavors and blackberries explode from the glass! They are followed by a lively, spicy finish that lingers on for minutes. This is excellent food wine that will not tire your palate out. It kind of reminds me of older J Swan Zinfandels that I grew up loving!
",Zinfandel
"You could attribute it to the dry farming methods, the old/perfectly located vines, or the careful and meticulous production, but either way, this wine shows some of the most elegant depth I have ever tasted. Blueberries, blackberries, and black cherries are carried by a white pepper spice throughout a long, enjoyable finish.
",Zinfandel
"Dry Creek Valley is always noted for its slightly cooler climate lending to brighter, more high-toned red fruit and spice notes and the Cortina is a classic Dry Creek Zin with its beautiful aromatics of sweet savory herbs matched by the presence of black raspbery, red plum and licorice. Accompanying the lifted black and red fruit on the nose is an assortment of subtle szechuan peppercorn, sweet bramble and savory baking spices.
",Zinfandel
"The base for this wine comes from a Dry Creek Valley vineyard planted in 1972. Since this was a year before I was born, I think even by French standards this is considered “old vines.”  Deliciously fresh and juicy, the Cortina Zinfandel glides across the palate with grace and ease. There is a wonderfully purity to the fruit in this wine. It is not heavy or overbearing but still a ripe, full-bodied wine.  Alcohol is under 15%.
",Zinfandel
"This highly rated Zinfandel is mouthwatering, luscious and clean, with a thread of gorgeous acidity. The fruit is grown in Chen Vineyard in Dry Creek Valley, which is known for gravelly soil and breezes that contribute to the high-toned red fruit on the palate. Notes of juicy raspberry, grilled Asian plum, nectarine and blackberry waft in and out, and with its medium-bodied, yet condensed and vibrant mouthfeel, you'll want more than just one glass.
",Zinfandel
"In Ridge's 50th year, they are still proving why they are considered some of the best Zin producers in California. The Geyserville (70% Zinfandel, 15% Carignane, 12% Petite Sirah, and 3% Alicante Bouschet) is a gorgeously dark and balanced example of what they do so well, showing warm baking spice, black and white pepper, and melted licorice on the nose, while the velvety strawberry and blackberry flavors coat the palate. The tannins are sweet but not without grip, and there is a vein of mouth-watering acidity that keeps things lifted. Incredible value.
",Zinfandel
"The 2015 Geyserville is a quintessential example of how great a vineyard and how amazing this wine has been for the last 50 years. Expressive notes of dark red berry and blackberry, clean bramble and savory baking spice explode on the nose but that's what you should expect from any zin-based field blend. The Geyserville is leagues above the rest with its rich, full bodied yet structured and lifted palate. It has fruit and texture while also being simultaneously savory and salty. And the final kicker of this already fabulous wine is the bright, quenching acidity on the finish that lets you know how well this elegant and structured wine will age.
",Zinfandel
"If anyone has ever asked themselves what is Great California Zinfandel ? Here is the answer . The Geyserville 50th is beautiful a dark purple and has dark fruit flavor with some bramble and earth. Lush & smooth with lift. drink now or lay down
",Zinfandel
"Ridge is without a doubt one of the best producers of Zinfandel in California and every year the Geyserville bottling is may favorite. This year proved that once again that pound for pound the Geyserville is my favorite Zinfandel in the store. What I love about this bottling is that there is always a beautiful acid core that drives this wine forward. This year shows lovely cool red fruit with notes of red berry and some spice. The 2015 vintage has excellent structure and like all of Ridge should age but is drinking so well right now it is hard to think about aging when you just want to start drinking.
",Zinfandel
"It's Geyserville's 50th anniversary, and the wine is everything you love about Geyserville. Always one of my favorite Zinfandel bottlings from Ridge, Geyserville is full, rich and luscious, without being flabby or sweet. The 2015 is already fairly open and expressive, with boisterous black fruit and subtle pepper spice. I can't wait to see where this vintage goes with a little time, though. There is plenty of structure and elegance here that will certainly make for great aging.
",Zinfandel
"I've been really excited about the new wave of Zinfandel producers that are finally getting their time in the spotlight these days. Focused on lighter, acid driven styles and concentrating their efforts on historic old vines, winemakers like Morgan Twain-Peterson of Bedrock and Mike Officer of Carlisle are shedding new light on one of California's oldest wines. This Valdez Zin fits perfectly into this new wave of producers. The St. Peter's Church Vineyard in Alexander Valley was planted in the 1880's and the average vine age on this wine is 90+. Light and spicy, lifted and yet structured, this is a great wine for anyone who looking for a monumental California Zinfandel that will definitely appreciate with age. .
",Zinfandel
"These guys are always impressing me with their restrained touch and cohesive structure. Whereas most Zinfandel from Central Coast exhibits jammy, over-ripe, and alcoholic inconsistencies, this one walks the line deftly and ends up sporting flavors of raisin, raspberry, licorice, and warm spices. The tannins are pronounced but velvety while a ribbon of fresh acidity threads from start to finish.
",Zinfandel
"Not over ripe, jammy or too high in alcohol, this is a beautifully balanced Zinfandel.  Cassis, figs, plums, berries and baking spice coat your palate with juicy acidity and soft, rich texture.  This is elegant Paso Zin!
",Zinfandel
"A beautiful Zinfandel, with all the exuberant notes one expect from this variety, but at the same time with an incredible sense of balance on the palate. Plums, blackberry and black cherries go side by side with dark chocolate and violets. The fresh acidity plays an essential role here. This is an elegant, fresh and incredibly food-friendly wine.
",Zinfandel
"I’ve always been a fan of Ancient Peaks, so I was excited to hear about another great collaboration. Classic Zinfandel flavors of plum, dark berry, and even some dried fruit are front and center, but balanced with lively baking spice, surprisingly solid acidity, and a soft finish. Fragrant and food-friendly, this is a great option for big red lovers who appreciate some subtlety.
",Zinfandel
"Balance is the name of the game here. This collaboration zinfandel between Ancient Peaks and K&L is an ideal example of how a slightly cooler climate zinfandel can reach those heights of showcasing a unique terroir all the while  being loaded with tons of  ripe wild berries and spice. Straight out of the glass you get intense bramble and vine ripened black berries and a slight hint of black pepper. With such a strong showing on the nose, you would expect a massive chewy fruit bomb but this is were the balance comes into play. Yes, there's the classic zin fruit that one would expect but it's so harmoniously supported by the fresh, crisp acidity. I love zins that ride that fine line between being terroir driven while staying true to the fruity, playful variety and Brick and the team at AP has made me fall in love with zin all over again.
",Zinfandel
"We have been anxiously awaiting the return of the Ancient Peak's / K&L zinfandel, and this second iteration absolutely lives up the hype! It is on the refreshingly lighter, prettier side of  zin, with fresh picked plum and blackberry, lively acidity, and light tannin on the finish. Beautifully balanced and easy drinking, this wine should easily find it's way to the front of your mid week and weekend selections.
",Zinfandel
"Ancient Peaks burst on the scene about a decade ago with one of the highest rated, inexpensive, Zinfandels to ever come out of California by Wine Spectator’s standards. I was intrigued by the winery wondering if they were just a tank farm somewhere down in Paso, or a legitimate producer that we needed to watch out for. In visiting them the following year I realized that they couldn’t be more in the latter camp. Their sizable estate vineyard has to be seen to be believed, with it impeccable vineyard management, incredible diversity of soil types and singular microclimate that betrays the notion of Paso Robles’s intense heat. Since that visit I have touted their wares and we’ve have sung the wineries praises to anyone that will listen. A few years back, on our initial round of co-branded wines with specific producers, we blended a delicious Zinfandel from Ancient Peaks. Many customers since then have asked us to make another so we obliged this year and we think this will bring back pleasant memories of that wine with its delicate juiciness and wealth of spice. This year this was the most difficult blend we put together. The winemaker and I kept fine tuning the wine trying to get the balance of fruit, ripeness, spice and mouth feel just right but I really believe that our hard work paid off. Blended from numerous different blocks aged in both neutral, newer (2nd & 3rd use barrels) and new oak this has already really integrated incredibly well. Intense and powerful on the nose this screams “I am ZIN!!!” with its mix of briary berry fruits and cracked black peppercorn. On the palate this turns a touch coating and creamy, but never feels heavy or has any residual sugar, and rides a high line of resonating boysenberry, cassis and dried sage flavors all coated in a fine dust of white pepper. The finish has some typical chewy tannins and adds a ton of power, and ultimately longevity, with additions of cocoa powder, black cherry and flowering lavender. If you weren’t a believer before this just might turn the tide, if you were a believer then be ready to become a fanatic.
",Zinfandel
"Every now and again I ask myself: why don't I drink more zinfandel? Then I buy a bottle of something that's too ripe, too sweet, and too high in alcohol and I remember. But tasting this beautifully balanced offering from Ancient Peaks, I'm reminded of all the things I really love about zin: the juicy, mouthwatering fruit, the fleshy berries that coat my palate, the supple and soft mouthfeel that washes down the finish. It's all happening here in this K&L cuvee, but all the elements are harmonic. It's a zinfandel you drink again and again.
",Zinfandel
"Gobs of black plum, dark cherry fruit and a plush, spicy finish.  Oh, all for less than twenty five bucks? Count me in.  Pair this wine with your next round of grilled tri-tip or ribs.  This co-branded Zin is easily my top value-red coming out of the Paso Robles.
",Zinfandel
"This is a Zinfandel for those who know their Zins, a sophisticated and beautifully lifted elixir with a full, liquidy palate and aromas of wild cherry, candied raspberry and hibiscus, all you would expect from Dry Creek Old Vine Zinfandel. The real kicker is the surprising herbaceous midpalate, which differs from the 2015, which is more fruit driven and restrained. Notes of star anise and white mushroom peek through the fruit laden suspension with a bright and refreshing acidity.
",Zinfandel
"Mount Peak's Rattlesnake Zinfandel is gorgeous and packs a real punch with concentration and high quality fruit. The majority of this wine comes from the Monte Rosso Vineyard, a renowned site in the Mayacamas Range with bright-red, volcanic soils and 100+ year old vines. This wine is loaded with dark berries, pepper, oaky spice and a rich, full-bodied, silky finish. A perfect match for the classic California Zinfandel lover!
",Zinfandel
"Having been the spirits buyer at K&L for almost a decade, I'm quite familiar with the idea of reopening ""lost"" distilleries, as well as the return of old brands that has been quite the fad over the last few years. However, I had yet to hear about an ancient California wine producer coming back to life until tasting the new releases from Mount Peak, a ""ghost"" winery that has been resurrected by Gallo (who have been busy in the boutique world, nabbing historic brandy CA producer Germain-Robin as well). While I was surprised by the history behind Mount Peak, I have to admit I was more surprised by the combination of power, potency, and finesse in all of the wines. Normally 15+% ABV wines are not my cup of tea, but these babies had gusto. The Rattlesnake zinfandel is bursting with berries, vibrant spice, and a silky, softly-textured body that coats the palate with massive concentration.

"This is an elegant, yet concentrated interpretation of a Sonoma County Zinfandel, a varietal that is commonly understood to be somewhat of an exhibitionist. Valravn is brought to us by the folks at Banshee, who are known for crafting quality wines from exceptionally good fruit, at smart price points. The 2014 Valravn Old Vine Zinfandel is right in line with the Banshee philosophy, made from Dry Creek and Sonoma vines, some of which have seen over 100 years on this planet. Let them tell you their story!
",Zinfandel
"Made from the same folks who produce Banshee (one of  my favorite California producers), this Zinfandel has made me a convert.  I'm typically not one to pick up a bottle of Zinfandel, but this is one that surprised me.  It's got lift and freshness.  There are a lot darker fruit notes such as plum compote and stewed black cherries along with some complexity coming from baking spice, pepper and cocoa to make things interesting.  This is the wine you want for BBQ's this summer!
",Zinfandel
"A Zinfandel that truly surprises. Classic in expression with notes of ripe plum, strawberry jam, raspberry, and violets. On the palate, the wine is full bodied with an elevated acidity that is certainly welcome. Flavors of dark cherry and dried berries intermingle with subtle hints of cocoa, cinnamon and sweet tobacco. For under $20, this is a steal.
",Zinfandel
"I recall a winemaker once explaining how difficult Zinfandel could be to grow since the grape clusters tend to ripen unevenly, with some grapes still mostly green while others had started to raisin. I have always thought that the best California Zins seem to capture the essence of this phenomenon, being both tart and richly sweet all at once. The new 2014 Valravn Old Vine Sonoma County Zinfandel hits all the marks with lively acidity and rich, sweet dark fruit. Superb varietal typicity here and an absolutely delicious bottle of wine.
",Zinfandel
"This is a Zinfandel that is worth every penny. Strawberries and raspberries are layered with chocolate and a hint of coffee, just for fun. A full bodied and rich wine that would go great with BBQ or roasted vegetables.
",Zinfandel
"A fantastically rich, energetic, complex, and bright CA classic through and through. Our close friends over at Banshee Wines have given us another huge value driven Zinfandel to enjoy all year. Fresh strawberry and mountain berry flavors, amazing concentration with a nice cocoa/nutmeg note and texture. The balance, generosity, and great floral scented nose make this my new go-to Zinfandel.
",Zinfandel
"Born and bottled in the heart of the Sonoma Valley, this rustic, dry-farmed ancient vine Zinfandel reminds me of why I moved to California almost forty years ago, in search of those intangible truths that can only be found in the cultivated company of rare friends over a good bottle of wine. Zinfandel is and always will be a grape that expresses itself with passionate intensity and it’s such a pleasure to discover that some folks (the Banshee guys) are still making it like I remember it from the 1970s, those special wines of character, purity and harmony that leave their imprint on the mind as well as the palate. And reading up on the mythological origins of the 'Valravn' can chill one's bones, as it depicts a monstrous raven who scours the bloody battlefields of Danish lore in search of  fresh meat. Never thee mind, all this delicious wine does is slay your mortal thirst, my ravenous friends!
",Zinfandel
"A bright and spicy style of Zin.  Full and rich on the palate but with pop and lift that you don't always see from the varietal.

"Absolutely new project from the guys over at Banshee Wines. 100% Zinfandel sourced from a number of historic vineyards throughout Sonoma County. Lush dark fruit, spice and soft tannins round out this elegant wine.
